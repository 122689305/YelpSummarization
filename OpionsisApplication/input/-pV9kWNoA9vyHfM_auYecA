This/DT place/NN used/VBD to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorites/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT last/JJ time/NN I/PRP was/VBD there/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB disappointing/JJ ./.
The/DT menu/NN was/VBD much/RB smaller/JJR than/IN it/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB ,/, and/CC an/DT old/JJ favorite/JJ (/NN Cobb/NNP Caesar/NNP )/NNP was/VBD subpar/NN :/: salty/NN ,/, rubbery/NN chicken/NN ,/, not/RB as/IN many/JJ vegetables/NNS ,/, smaller/JJR portion/NN overall/NNS and/CC no/DT presentation/NN ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP they/PRP improve/VBP soon/RB !/.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT eggs/NNS Benedict/NNP ./.

Yuck/NNP !/.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN around/IN they/PRP were/VBD perfect/NN ./.

Ham/NNP too/RB thick/RB ,/, but/CC still/RB tasty/NN ./.
Super/NNP yummy/NNP homemade/NN english/JJ muffin/NN ./.
Rustic/JJ to/TO say/VB the/DT least/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD start/VB by/IN saying/NNP there/NNP is/VBZ much/JJ to/TO like/NN about/IN this/DT restaurant/NN from/IN a/DT location/NN and/CC aesthetics/NNS standpoint/NN ./.
It/PRP really/RB drew/VBD us/PRP in/IN ./.
The/DT night/NN we/PRP ate/VBP there/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD really/RB busy/JJ and/CC we/PRP sat/VBP outside/VBN with/IN a/DT view/NN of/IN the/DT capitol/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD kind/NN of/IN forgotton/NN about/IN and/CC had/VBD to/TO wait/VB a/DT really/RB long/JJ time/NN for/IN all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP gluten/VBN free/JJ and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ reason/NN I/PRP am/VBP writing/VBG this/DT review/NN ./.
I/PRP find/VBP reviews/NNS of/IN how/WRB restaurants/NNS handle/NN those/DT who/WP eat/NN this/DT way/NN ,/, for/IN whatever/JJR reason/NN ,/, so/RB helpful/JJ ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN has/VBZ a/DT GF/NNP menu/NN (/NN I/PRP have/VBP celiac/JJ )/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT huge/JJ bonus/NN ./.
However/RB my/JJ soup/NN which/WDT I/PRP ordered/VBD off/RP the/DT GF/NNP menu/NN came/VBD out/RP with/IN a/DT huge/JJ slice/NN of/IN sourdough/JJ laying/VBG on/IN the/DT soup/JJ spoon/NN ./.
Not/RB a/DT huge/JJ deal/NN to/TO get/VB another/DT spoon/NN but/CC made/VBD me/PRP nervous/JJ as/IN to/TO how/WRB aware/JJ they/PRP really/RB were/VBD ./.
Then/RB the/DT wait/NN for/IN our/PRP$ entrees/NNS took/VBD so/RB long/RB I/PRP had/VBD to/TO leave/NNS with/IN my/JJ 2/NN year/NN old/JJ daughter/NN because/IN she/PRP had/VBD run/VBN out/IN of/IN patience/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ great/VBN on/IN less/JJR busy/NN nights/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT experience/NN that/IN night/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB to/TO try/VB the/DT food/NN but/CC I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT beer/NN selection/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN meaning/VBG to/TO try/VB the/DT stuff/JJ out/NN of/IN Surly/NNP 's/POS and/CC this/DT was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ chance/NN ./.
Pro-tip/NN :/: have/VBP a/DT few/JJ and/CC go/VB wander/NN around/IN inside/NN the/DT state/NN capitol/NN building/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB outside/JJ ,/, quite/JJ beautiful/JJ ,/, and/CC is/VBZ extra/JJ nice/NN with/IN a/DT buzz/NN ./.
Pork/NNP Belly/NNP Mac/NNP ./.
Best/NNP thing/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
Great/NNP beer/NN selection/NN too/RB ./.
The/DT mussels/NNS are/VBP good/JJ too/RB !/.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ always/RB busy/NN and/CC takes/VBZ no/DT reservations/NNS ./.
The/DT upstairs/NNS room/NN has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN open/JJ when/WRB we/PRP go/VBP ,/, do/VBP n't/RB know/VB of/IN anyone/NN else/NN has/VBZ had/VBN that/IN experience/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP new/JJ to/TO Madison/NN and/CC was/VBD hoping/JJ to/TO find/VB ``/`` my/NN ''/'' bar/NN ;/: I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ it/PRP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB try/VB thee/JJ food/NN but/CC the/DT couple/NN next/JJ to/TO me/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT appetizer/NN they/PRP were/VBD eating/VBG ./.
The/DT bartender/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC let/JJ me/NNS have/VBP a/DT taste/JJ test/NN of/IN a/DT stout/NN when/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD how/WRB it/PRP compared/VBN to/TO Guinness/NN ./.
Very/NNP good/JJ bar/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ beer/NN selection/NN and/CC better/JJR than/IN average/JJ food/NN ./.
The/DT fish/JJ fry/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ,/, featuring/VBG three/CD large/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN haddock/NN ,/, plenty/NN of/IN fries/NNS ,/, malt/NN vinegar/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT shot/NN glass/NN of/IN tartar/NN ./.
The/DT coleslaw/NN was/VBD subaverage/NN and/CC boring/NN ./.
Brussels/NNS sprouts/VBZ salad/NN was/VBD a/DT surprise/NN standout/NN ,/, with/IN real/JJ bacon/NN bits/NNS ,/, a/DT lightly/RB applied/VBN but/CC heavy/JJ cream/NN sauce/NN ,/, and/CC excellent/JJ blue/JJ cheese/NN ./.
The/DT sprouts/NNS were/VBD served/VBN cold/JJ but/CC perfectly/RB cooked/VBD ./.
Croutons/NNS were/VBD inexplicably/RB bland/JJ --/: they/PRP were/VBD little/RB more/JJR than/IN over/IN toasted/VBN bread/NN with/IN no/DT seasoning/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT salad/JJ itself/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Poutine/NNP is/VBZ decent/JJ ;/: it/PRP 's/VBZ all/DT well/RB executed/VBN local/JJ ingredients/NNS but/CC tastes/VBZ nothing/NN like/IN the/DT rendition/NN I/PRP had/VBD in/IN Montreal/NNP ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ where/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ off/RP ,/, perhaps/RB the/DT gravy/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ still/RB decadent/JJ and/CC tasty/JJ ,/, if/IN not/RB authentic/JJ ./.
During/VBG peak/NN hours/NNS they/PRP cram/VBP people/NNS in/IN a/DT bit/NN too/RB closely/RB for/IN my/PRP$ taste/NN ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP practically/RB on/IN top/NN of/IN your/PRP$ neighbor/NN here/RB ./.
In/IN off/JJ hours/NN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT comfortable/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/NN and/CC have/VBP a/DT drink/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT bar/NN stools/NNS are/VBP surprisingly/RB comfortable/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
Some/DT friends/NNS and/CC I/PRP went/VBD to/TO Cooper/NNP 's/POS Tavern/NNP for/IN lunch/NN recently/RB while/IN I/PRP was/VBD in/IN town/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD immediately/RB impressed/VBN by/IN the/DT simple/JJ yet/NN good/JJ looking/NN menu/NN ,/, and/CC had/VBD a/DT tough/JJ time/NN deciding/VBG between/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT salads/NNS and/CC the/DT veggie/NN sandwich/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT sandwich/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
They/PRP give/VBP you/PRP practically/RB an/DT entree/NN mixed/NN greens/NNS salad/JJ along/IN with/IN the/DT sandwich/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB filling/JJ ,/, and/CC tasty/NN ./.
My/NNP friends/VBZ enjoyed/VBN their/PRP$ burgers/NNS ./.
What/WP I/PRP was/VBD especially/VBN impressed/VBN by/IN ,/, however/RB ,/, were/VBD the/DT appetizers/NNS ./.
We/PRP got/VBD frites/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ favorite/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT pretzel/beer/NN cheese/NN app/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD great/JJ ./.
We/PRP also/RB had/VBD great/VBN service/NN and/CC found/VBD it/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT nice/JJ atmosphere/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD see/VB returning/NN for/IN some/DT beer/NN one/CD night/NN !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO Cooper/NNP 's/POS a/DT lot/NN and/CC have/VBP always/RB been/VBN happy/NN !/.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN brunch/NN and/CC had/VBD the/DT daily/JJ quiche/NN -/NN glazed/VBN carrots/NNS ,/, arugula/NN ,/, and/CC feta/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
We/PRP got/VBD to/TO sit/NN in/IN the/DT private/JJ room/NN in/IN the/DT back/NN that/IN is/VBZ connected/VBN to/TO the/DT bar/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ my/VBG favorite/JJ place/NN to/TO sit/NN ./.
The/DT waiter/NN takes/VBZ your/PRP$ order/NN and/CC gives/VBZ you/PRP your/VBP food/NN through/IN a/DT window/NN from/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
The/DT room/NN is/VBZ very/RB intimate/JJ and/CC quiet/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ great/JJ for/IN groups/NNS of/IN 5-8/JJ people/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP also/RB been/VBN here/RB for/IN dinner/NN a/DT few/JJ times/NNS ,/, and/CC loved/VBD it/PRP every/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB affordable/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT location/NN is/VBZ really/RB convenient/JJ ./.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT huge/JJ selection/NN of/IN beers/NNS and/CC wines/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP come/VBP at/IN night/NN on/IN a/DT weekend/NN ,/, they/PRP open/VBP the/DT upstairs/NNS room/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ another/DT bar/NN area/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB with/IN a/DT big/JJ group/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD a/DT large/JJ table/JJ that/IN could/MD fit/VB all/DT of/IN us/PRP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP coming/VBG here/RB ,/, and/CC highly/RB recommend/VB it/PRP !/.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP ate/VBP here/RB last/JJ night/NN as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT Madison/NNP Fair/NNP Share/NNP fundraiser/NN dinner/NN and/CC my/PRP$ group/NN was/VBD very/RB excited/JJ ./.
We/PRP paid/VBD $/$ 50/CD for/IN our/PRP$ tickets/NNS which/WDT included/-NONE- 3/VBZ courses/NNS -/JJ each/DT paired/VBN with/IN a/DT beer/NN from/IN One/CD Barrel/NNP Brewing/NNP ./.
What/WP could/MD be/VB better/RBR than/IN a/DT menu/NN that/WDT is/VBZ hand/JJ crafted/VBN from/IN local/JJ ingredients/NNS that/WDT were/VBD grown/VBN and/CC brewed/VBD around/IN Madison/NNP ,/, right/NN ?/.
Well/NNP ,/, unfortunately/RB for/IN us/PRP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT huge/JJ disappointment/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD an/DT appetizer/NN that/IN consisted/JJ of/IN shredded/JJ cucumber/NN ,/, a/DT rich/NN buttery/NN sauce/NN ,/, and/CC nice/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN bread/JJ ./.
Very/NNP delicious/JJ and/CC refreshing/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ course/NN was/VBD braised/VBN rabbit/JJ served/VBN on/IN a/DT bed/VBN of/IN RPs/NNS fettuccine/VBP with/IN a/DT creamy/NN mushroom/NN and/CC beer/NN sauce/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD really/RB delicious/JJ ,/, especially/RB whatever/JJR crispy/NN things/NNS they/PRP put/VBP on/IN top/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD ,/, at/IN best/JJS ,/, lukewarm/NN when/WRB we/PRP received/VBP it/PRP ./.
The/DT beer/NN was/VBD very/RB delicious/JJ -/NN an/DT American/JJ Pale/NNP Ale/NNP ./.
The/DT second/JJ course/NN was/VBD where/WRB things/NNS went/VBD wrong/JJ ./.
Strangely/RB enough/RB ,/, they/PRP served/VBD us/PRP salad/RB after/IN the/DT main/JJ course/NN ./.
It/PRP consisted/VBD of/IN a/DT pile/NN of/IN pickled/JJ vegetables/NNS ,/, including/VBG pickled/VBN morel/NN mushrooms/NNS ,/, rhubarb/NN ,/, radish/JJ ,/, and/CC asparagus/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD served/VBN on/IN a/DT bed/VBN of/IN greens/NNS with/IN an/DT ipa/NN vinaigrette/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD very/RB excited/JJ about/IN this/DT dish/JJ at/IN first/JJ -/JJ I/PRP LOVE/NNP pickled/VBD stuff/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT idea/NN of/IN pickled/JJ morels/NNS was/VBD very/RB exciting/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, everything/NN about/IN the/DT dish/JJ was/VBD absolutely/RB overwhelming/JJ and/CC rather/RB cringe/JJ worthy/NN ./.
The/DT vinaigrette/NN mixed/NN with/IN the/DT pickling/VBG brine/NN made/VBD our/PRP$ eyes/NNS water/NN ,/, the/DT anise/NN was/VBD confusing/JJ and/CC disgusting/JJ (/NN admittedly/RB ,/, this/DT may/MD be/VB a/DT personal/JJ preference/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP all/DT disliked/VBN it/PRP )/-NONE- ,/, and/CC the/DT greens/NNS were/VBD overshadowed/VBN by/IN all/DT of/IN this/DT ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP this/DT had/VBD been/VBN A./VBN served/VBN before/IN the/DT main/JJ dish/NN ,/, B./NNP had/VBD fewer/JJR pickles/NNS OR/IN a/DT less/JJR intense/JJ vinaigrette/NN ,/, and/CC C./NNP had/VBD more/RBR greens/NNS to/TO even/RB it/PRP all/DT out/NN ./.
The/DT beer/NN with/IN this/DT one/NN was/VBD also/RB a/DT loser/NN for/IN us/PRP -/JJ but/CC we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/IN IPA/NNP ,/, so/RB that/IN is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO gauge/NN ./.
The/DT third/JJ and/CC final/JJ course/NN was/VBD a/DT dessert/NN consisting/NN of/IN a/DT strawberry/JJ and/CC rhubarb/JJ sauce/NN ,/, a/DT key-lime/JJ curd/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT rather/RB odd/JJ white/JJ puffy/JJ thing/NN resembling/VBG a/DT cham/NN tort/NN ./.
None/NN of/IN us/PRP finished/VBD it/PRP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD insanely/RB sweet/JJ ,/, the/DT white/JJ puffy/JJ thing/NN was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN gross/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB not/RB satisfying/VBG ./.
The/DT beer/NN served/VBD with/IN this/DT was/VBD really/RB rather/RB ghastly/RB as/RB well/RB -/JJ it/PRP was/VBD a/DT wheat/JJ beer/NN and/CC it/PRP seriously/RB tasted/VBD like/IN cigarette/NN ash/NN ./.
We/PRP each/VBP managed/VBN to/TO take/VB 2/NN or/CC 3/NN sips/NNS to/TO try/NNS and/CC figure/VB out/RP what/WP it/PRP was/VBD we/PRP were/VBD tasting/VBG ,/, but/CC after/IN that/DT could/MD n't/RB take/VB another/DT drink/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD rather/RB drink/VB budweiser/NN or/CC old/JJ milwaukee/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ just/RB about/IN the/DT worst/NN insult/NN I/PRP can/MD give/VB to/TO a/DT beer/NN ./.
Final/JJ comments/NNS :/: I/PRP had/VBD a/DT really/RB delicious/JJ old/JJ fashioned/VBN (/NN brandy/NN ,/, sweet/JJ )/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD really/RB great/JJ ./.
The/DT wait/NN staff/NN were/VBD really/RB on/IN top/NNS of/IN things/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT owner/NN was/VBD out/IN there/RB busting/VBG his/PRP$ butt/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
I/PRP will/MD consider/VB going/VBG back/RB for/IN their/PRP$ regular/JJ food/NN some/DT day/NN ,/, I/PRP just/RB hope/VBP this/DT poorly/RB executed/VBN menu/NN was/VBD a/DT fluke/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT norm/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, it/PRP helped/VBD support/VB a/DT group/NN I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ doing/VBG really/RB great/JJ things/NNS and/CC I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ I/PRP did/VBD it/PRP ,/, I/PRP just/RB wish/VBP it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN a/DT little/JJ better/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
Had/IN the/DT chicken/NN thigh/JJ pot/NN pie/NN and/CC Belgium/NN frites/NNS ./.
Absolutely/RB perfect/JJ ./.
The/DT drink/NN menu/NN had/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN everything/NN ./.
Sat/NNP upstairs/NNS because/IN the/DT downstairs/NNS was/VBD packed/VBN and/CC had/VBD a/DT great/JJ time/NN ./.
Staff/NNP was/VBD attentive/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
A/DT 45/NN minute/NN wait/NN turned/VBD into/IN a/DT 70/JJ minute/NN wait/NN ./.
No/DT exaggeration/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD adequate/JJ but/CC nothing/JJ spectacular/NN ./.
Menu/NNP is/VBZ very/RB limited/JJ ./.
Beer/NNP list/NNP was/VBD vast/RB ,/, but/CC so/RB are/VBP the/DT beer/NN lists/NNS elsewhere/RB ./.
Far/NNP too/RB small/JJ for/IN large/JJ groups/NNS ./.
Couples/NNS should/MD have/VB no/DT problems/NNS but/CC groups/NNS of/IN 4/NN or/CC more/JJR will/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB forever/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
Very/NNP loud/VBD ,/, probably/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT cramped/JJ environment/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP stand/RB out/IN a/DT little/NN from/IN the/DT normal/JJ Food/NNP Fight/NNP establishment/NN but/CC I/PRP doubt/VBP I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP love/JJ this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
Tonight/NNP though/NNP ,/, the/DT kids/NNS '/POS meals/NNS left/VBD much/RB to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ./.
The/DT skewered/VBD chicken/NN ,/, while/IN abundant/JJ ,/, was/VBD very/RB dry/JJ ./.
My/NNP daughter/NN tried/VBD to/TO eat/VB it/PRP ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP thought/VBD my/PRP$ Brussels/NNS sprouts/VBZ salad/RB would/MD be/VB a/DT warm/NN addition/NN of/IN pan/JJ seared/JJ sprouts/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD only/RB okay/JJ ./.
At/IN least/JJS we/PRP started/VBP with/IN my/PRP$ fav/NN ,/, the/DT frites/NNS with/IN the/DT vinegar/NN mayo/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT kids/NNS meals/NNS need/VBP work/NN ./.

Service/NNP was/VBD excellent/JJ as/IN always/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT limited/JJ review/NN ,/, very/RB limited/JJ ./.
We/PRP stopped/VBD at/IN The/DT Cooper/NNP 's/POS Tavern/NNP for/IN drinks/NNS on/IN a/DT whim/JJ because/IN we/PRP have/VBP some/DT time/NN before/IN our/PRP$ dinner/NN reservation/NN and/CC thought/VBD we/PRP 'd/MD check/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
Since/IN it/PRP was/VBD before/IN dinner/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN cocktails/NNS ./.
In/IN retrospect/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD have/VB went/VBN with/IN something/NN from/IN the/DT well-stocked/JJ beer/NN list/NN instead/RB ./.
Both/DT my/NN wife/NN and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT vodka/NN gimlet/NN ./.
When/WRB it/PRP finally/RB arrived/VBD (/NN through/IN no/DT fault/NN of/IN the/DT server/NN ,/, the/DT bartender/NN was/VBD just/RB pfaffing/VBG around/IN and/CC talking/VBG to/TO other/JJ drinkers/NNS while/IN he/PRP should/MD have/VB been/VBN also/RB making/VBG drinks/NNS )/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD disappointed/VBN ./.
The/DT drinks/VBZ seemed/NN to/TO be/VB largely/RB composed/VBN of/IN ice/NN and/CC rose/VBD 's/POS lime/NN juice/NN ;/: vodka/NN was/VBD in/IN short/JJ supply/NN and/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT lime/NN wedge/NN ./.
Lame/NNP ,/, just/RB lame/NN ./.
We/PRP sat/VBD at/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT tables/NNS in/IN the/DT front/NN of/IN the/DT house/NN ,/, the/DT one/NN 's/POS made/NN from/IN a/DT barrel/NN with/IN a/DT tabletop/NN ./.

The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT decor/NN seems/VBZ a/DT bit/NN confused/VBN (/NN rustic/JJ bar/NN on/IN one/CD side/NN ,/, pseudo-modern/JJ restaurant/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, barrel/NN tables/NNS up/IN front/JJ )/NN ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB stay/VB to/TO eat/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB speak/VB to/TO that/DT ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ if/IN we/PRP 'll/VBP return/NN for/IN dinner/NN or/CC not/RB ,/, but/CC if/IN we/PRP do/VBP ,/, it/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB soon/RB ./.
It/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN Food/NNP Fight/NNP restaurants/NNS have/VBP a/DT rather/RB quick/JJ aging/VBG curve/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT food/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP never/RB super/JJR impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
The/DT last/JJ time/NN I/PRP went/VBD I/PRP got/VBD a/DT grilled/JJ chicken/NN sandwich/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD the/DT texture/NN of/IN a/DT chicken/NN patty/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD very/RB excited/JJ to/TO try/NN coops/NNS ,/, many/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ work/NN friends/NNS had/VBD tried/VBN it/PRP and/CC had/VBD nothing/NN but/CC good/JJ things/NN to/TO say/VB ./.
With/IN that/DT in/IN mind/NN I/PRP went/VBD in/IN with/IN rather/RB high/JJ expectations/NNS ./.

Despite/IN this/DT mediocre/NN experience/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP optimistic/JJ that/IN the/DT place/NN has/VBZ more/VBN to/TO offer/NN and/CC can/MD redeem/VB itself/PRP ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT mafia-like/JJ Madison/NN restaurant/VB junta/NN known/NNS as/IN Food/NNP Fight/NNP ./.

The/DT actual/JJ building/NN that/IN Cooper/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ in/IN used/NN to/TO house/VB a/DT two-story/JJ McDonald/NNP 's/POS ,/, hooray/NN ./.
You/PRP figure/VBP that/IN getting/JJ rid/NN of/IN one/CD McDonald/NNP 's/POS ,/, in/IN the/DT grand/NN scheme/NN of/IN things/NNS ,/, probably/RB does/VBZ n't/RB do/VB much/RB ./.

The/DT man/NN suggested/VBD going/VBG to/TO Coopers/NNP instead/NNP and/CC I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ choice/NN ,/, at/IN first/JJ ./.
They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP an/DT expansive/JJ beer/NN selection/NN and/CC though/IN I/PRP am/VBP far/RB from/IN a/DT beer/NN connoisser/NN I/PRP found/VBD a/DT rasberry/JJ one/NN that/IN I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBD ./.
The/DT food/NN at/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ meh/NN though/IN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD an/DT egg/NN roll/NN dish/JJ with/IN mash/JJ potatoes/NNS and/CC roast/NN beef/NN that/WDT was/VBD okay/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD deep/JJ fried/JJ and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN deep/JJ fried/JJ ./.

The/DT mac/NN :/: Sauce/NNP was/VBD awful/JJ ./.
The/DT dubliner/NN cheddar/NN in/IN the/DT sauce/JJ made/NN for/IN a/DT grainy/NN texture/NN with/IN very/RB little/JJ flavor/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN at/IN many/JJ times/NNS the/DT dominant/JJ taste/NN was/VBD flour/JJ .../: someone/NN evidently/RB needs/VBZ to/TO work/VB on/IN their/PRP$ roux/NN ./.

My/NNP next/NNP visit/NN ,/, I/PRP got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN :/: Rubbery/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ,/, tough/NN on/IN the/DT outside/JJ but/CC with/IN no/DT sear/NN whatsoever/NN on/IN this/DT ``/`` pan-seared/JJ ''/'' chicken/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB even/RB sure/JJ how/NN to/TO achieve/VB this/DT texture/NN .../: steaming/VBG ?/.

Half/NNP inch/NN thick/NN slices/NNS of/IN hard/JJ ,/, toasted/VBN bread/JJ saturated/VBN with/IN butter/NN or/CC some/DT kind/NN of/IN oil/NN ./.

The/DT roof/NN of/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN thanks/NNS you/PRP in/IN advance/NN ./.
The/DT accoutrements/NNS :/: While/IN technically/RB there/RB ,/, the/DT bacon/NN ,/, avocado/NN ,/, butter/NN lettuce/NN and/CC cheddar/NN toppings/NNS were/VBD not/RB present/JJ in/IN sufficient/JJ quantity/NN to/TO contribute/VB anything/NN to/TO the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT sandwich/JJ ,/, really/RB unfortunate/JJ ;/: it/PRP was/VBD this/DT combination/NN of/IN toppings/NNS that/WDT actually/RB drew/VBD me/PRP to/TO the/DT sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT chipotle/NN mayo/NN added/VBD a/DT nice/JJ hint/NN of/IN smokiness/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD the/DT only/JJ positive/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT experience/NN ./.
DESPITE/NNP the/DT truly/NN mediocre/NN food/NN ,/, the/DT service/NN has/VBZ been/VBN fantastic/JJ here/RB every/DT time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP gone/NN ./.
The/DT servers/NNS seem/VBP genuinely/RB apologetic/JJ about/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC very/RB knowledgeable/JJ about/IN the/DT beers/NNS they/PRP DO/RB have/VBP that/DT might/MD be/VB SIMILAR/RB to/TO what/WP I/PRP actually/RB wanted/VBD ./.
Suffice/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, I/PRP likely/VBP wo/MD n't/RB go/VB back/RB here/RB again/RB ./.

Came/NN here/RB for/IN Sunday/NNP brunch/NN because/IN the/DT Old/NNP Fashioned/NNP was/VBD too/RB busy/JJ ./.
The/DT decor/NN sets/VBZ one/CD 's/POS mind/JJ back/NN to/TO a/DT rustic/JJ 1980/CD 's/POS bar/NN with/IN modern/JJ TVs/NNS ./.
The/DT actual/JJ setup/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ awkward/NN and/CC tailored/VBD more/RBR to/TO a/DT bar/NN than/IN a/DT resteraunt/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ called/VBN Cooper/NNP 's/POS Tavern/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD decent/JJ with/IN a/DT few/JJ minor/NN execution/NN errors/VBZ (/RB too/RB much/JJ cayenne/NN ,/, over/IN and/CC under/IN poached/VBN eggs/NNS ,/, way/NN too/RB much/JJ salt/NN )/NN ./.
Did/NNP find/VBD a/DT hair/NN in/IN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ plates/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ though/NN ./.
Overall/IN an/DT average/JJ place/NN with/IN average/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD imagine/VB it/PRP is/VBZ better/VBG for/IN the/DT bar/NN scene/NN
Matilda/NNP on/IN tap/NN ./.
Hennepin/NNP on/IN tap/NN ./.
Beer/NNP cheese/NN and/CC pretzels/NNS and/CC pouitine/NN were/VBD phenomenal/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ our/VBG go/NN to/TO place/NN ./.
Plenty/NN of/IN comfort/NN food/NN for/IN those/DT cold/NN nights/NNS and/CC a/DT nice/JJ beer/NN collection/NN on/IN tap/NN ./.
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN an/DT anniversary/JJ dinner/NN with/IN friends/NNS before/IN a/DT show/NN at/IN the/DT Overture/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD the/DT second/JJ time/NN we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN here/RB ,/, and/CC thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO go/VB with/IN our/PRP$ friends/NNS ./.
We/PRP started/VBD out/RP with/IN the/DT poutine/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
For/IN the/DT main/JJ ,/, I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT sweet/JJ corn/NN Caesar/NN salad/NN ,/, which/WDT sounded/JJ amazing/VBG ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, this/DT was/VBD not/RB the/DT case/NN ./.
The/DT corn/NN relish/NN was/VBD seemingly/RB non-existent/JJ ./.
Corn/NNP was/VBD in/IN the/DT salad/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB seem/VB like/IN it/PRP was/VBD part/NN of/IN a/DT relish/JJ ./.
The/DT dressing/NN was/VBD a/DT poblano-caesar/JJ dressing/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB taste/VB the/DT poblano/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, this/DT was/VBD just/RB a/DT mediocre/NN salad/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC a/DT friend/NN each/DT had/VBD the/DT turkey/NN sandwich/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT actual/JJ slices/NNS of/IN turkey/NN breast/NN ,/, and/CC thought/VBD the/DT sandwich/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Our/NNP friend/NN 's/POS husband/NN had/VBD the/DT Reuben/VBN sandwich/NN ./.
When/WRB the/DT server/NN set/VBD it/PRP on/IN the/DT table/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN to/TO see/VB how/WRB dark/JJ the/DT rye/NN was/VBD ,/, although/IN the/DT description/NN did/VBD say/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT black/JJ rye/NN ./.
The/DT description/NN was/VBD correct/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT blackness/NN was/VBD due/JJ to/TO it/PRP being/VBG burnt/NN ./.
How/NNP this/DT got/NN past/VBD anyone/NN as/IN being/VBG acceptable/JJ to/TO serve/NN is/VBZ beyond/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT server/NN said/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB taken/VBN off/RP the/DT bill/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP this/DT place/NN is/VBZ OK/IN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG for/IN happy/JJ hour/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ beer/NN list/NN and/CC good/JJ appetizers/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB we/PRP 'll/MD go/VB here/RB again/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP much/JJ better/NN choices/NNS in/IN Madison/NNP and/CC on/IN the/DT square/NN ./.
Edit/NN :/: they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB take/VB the/DT sandwich/JJ off/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, just/RB the/DT one/CD beer/NN that/IN he/PRP drank/VBD ./.
Again/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB ./.

Especially/RB with/IN the/DT frites/NNS (/NN and/CC that/IN aioli/NN ?/VBD !/NNP )/NNP
and/CC the/DT southwestern/JJ Caesar/NNP salad/NN -/NN it/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN guacamole/NN and/CC a/DT Caesar/NNP salad/JJ mixed/NN together/NN ./.
Amazing/VBG ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ always/RB attentive/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ ,/, too/RB ;/: I/PRP got/VBD a/DT great/JJ ,/, filling/JJ lunch/NN with/IN a/DT friend/NN for/IN $/$ 10/CD each/CD ./.
Tonight/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD down/RB on/IN state/NN street/NN and/CC I/PRP googled/VBD ``/`` reuben/VB sandwich/JJ Madison/NNS ,/, WI/NNP ./. ''/''

And/CC let/IN me/PRP tell/VBP you/PRP ,/, the/DT divine/JJ direction/NN of/IN the/DT Google/NNP gods/NNS did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB this/DT girl/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT reuben/NN sandwich/JJ with/IN Belgian/NNP frites/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN and/CC magner/NN 's/POS apple/NN cider/NN on/IN tap/NN ./.
The/DT reuben/NN is/VBZ as/RB good/JJ as/IN they/PRP say/VBP ./.
The/DT flavors/NNS of/IN corned/JJ beef/NN ,/, swiss/NN ,/, sauerkraut/NN ,/, and/CC dressing/VBG blend/NN to/TO perfectly/RB proportioned/VBN perfection/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ mellow/NN ,/, smokey/NN ,/, heaven/VBN on/IN toasted/VBN rye/NN bread/NN ./.
Here/NNP 's/POS the/DT clincher/NN :/: the/DT sauerkraut/NN is/VBZ marinated/VBN in/IN scotch/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 'll/MD order/VB the/DT Magner/NNP 's/POS again/NN ./.
Just/NNP not/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
On/IN ambiance/NN :/: it/PRP 's/VBZ long/RB ,/, narrow/NN ,/, warmly/RB lit/NN with/IN candles/NNS ./.
Everyone/NNP is/VBZ seated/VBN close/JJ together/NN ./.
Due/NNP to/TO the/DT sandwich/NN being/VBG so/RB yummy/RB ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP sufficiently/RB distracted/VBN from/IN the/DT guy/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN yelling/VBG like/IN a/DT caveman/NN at/IN the/DT Reds/NNP game/NN ./.
The/DT meals/NNS are/VBP a-ok/JJ but/CC some/DT wines/NNS that/IN I/PRP 'd/MD see/VB in/IN wine/NN shops/NNS on/IN the/DT drink/NN menu/NN are/VBP a/DT bit/NN over/IN price/NN or/CC just/RB a/DT half/NN full/JJ glass/NN ./.
So/RB one/CD day/NN while/IN here/RB in/IN Madison/NNP ,/, My/NNP Brazilian/NNP friend/NN Jessica/NNP and/CC I/PRP went/VBD there/RB for/IN dinner/NN and/CC the/DT one/CD thing/NN that/IN did/NN help/VB the/DT place/NN was/VBD the/DT service/NN for/IN the/DT host/NN at/IN the/DT door/NN making/VBG some/DT room/NN for/IN the/DT two/CD of/IN us/PRP ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB recall/VB his/PRP$ name/NN by/IN he/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB nice/JJ guy/NN and/CC hope/NN he/PRP is/VBZ get/VBG an/DT better/NN position/NN there/RB soon/RB ./.
But/CC when/WRB he/PRP ask/VBP us/PRP after/IN we/PRP sat/VBP down/RB what/WP he/PRP can/MD get/VB us/PRP ,/, we/PRP explain/VB to/TO him/PRP what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBP and/CC he/PRP told/VBD the/DT waiter/NN our/VBD drinks/NNS orders/NNS and/CC that/DT is/VBZ where/WRB it/PRP took/VBD a/DT turn/NN for/IN slow/JJ and/CC confuse/JJ waiter/NN service/NN ./.
The/DT waiter/NN after/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS came/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC ask/JJ what/NN can/MD I/VB start/IN you/PRP with/IN ?/.
By/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT male/JJ not/RB female/JJ waiter/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP reply/VBP back/RB and/CC told/VBD him/PRP we/PRP already/RB order/VBP when/WRB the/DT Host/NNP told/VBD you/PRP our/PRP$ drinks/NNS ./.
Then/IN he/PRP realize/VBD our/PRP$ drinks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN sitting/VBG at/IN the/DT bar/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN now/RB ./.
The/DT beer/NN was/VBD so/RB so/RB flat/JJ and/CC the/DT red/VBN was/VBD good/JJ doe/NN Jessica/NNP ./.
Now/RB when/WRB it/PRP come/VBD to/TO food/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT mussels/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN ,/, some/DT of/IN the/DT mussels/NNS under-cook/NN and/CC some/DT felt/NNS like/IN there/NNS were/VBD over/IN cooked/JJ ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ they/PRP mix/VBP one/CD order/NN with/IN another/DT because/IN they/PRP do/VBP that/IN kind/NN of/IN thing/NN in/IN a/DT kitchen/NN to/TO make/VB up/RP time/NN ./.
But/CC speaking/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, food/NN times/NNS were/VBD about/RB 20/JJ minute/JJ wait/NN for/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT couple/NN sitting/VBG next/JJ to/TO us/PRP that/IN were/VBD there/RB before/IN us/PRP just/RB waiting/VBG on/IN their/PRP$ food/NN and/CC we/PRP got/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN first/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN why/NN I/PRP said/VBD someone/NN mix/NN overcooked/VBN mussels/NNS with/IN undercooked/JJ mussels/NNS ./.
But/CC back/RB to/TO the/DT story/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP was/VBD saying/VBG before/RB ,/, we/PRP got/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN first/RB then/RB they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB receive/VB their/PRP$ food/NN until/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS after/IN we/PRP received/VBD our/PRP$ dinner/NN which/WDT means/IN the/DT same/JJ waiter/NN ca/MD n't/RB handle/VB pressure/NN in/IN a/DT fast/NN moving/VBG restaurant/NN ./.
Jessica/NNP and/CC I/PRP felted/VBD so/RB bad/JJ and/CC was/VBD concern/NN about/IN food/NN because/IN she/PRP was/VBD n't/RB really/RB happy/VB with/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN food/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB either/JJ but/CC trial/JJ and/CC error/JJ right/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP 'd/MD tip/VB over/IN 25/CD %/NN to/TO the/DT service/NN but/CC that/IN does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB I/PRP did/VBD that/IN for/IN the/DT waiter/NN ./.
he/PRP was/VBD slow/JJ and/CC only/RB return/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ just/RB twice/NN ,/, one/CD to/TO order/CD food/NN and/CC once/RB we/PRP had/VBD our/VBN meal/NN finish/JJ to/TO ask/VB us/PRP how/WRB was/VBD the/DT food/NN and/CC I/PRP spoke/VBP the/DT truth/NN ./.
So/RB So/RB this/DT can/MD use/VB more/RBR of/IN this/DT and/NN that/IN ./.
So/IN I/PRP went/VBD the/DT next/JJ time/NN with/IN a/DT friend/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT difference/NN in/IN food/NN and/CC time/NN to/TO see/VB if/IN there/NN was/VBD another/DT cook/NN in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO try/VB something/NN out/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD difference/VBN after/IN eating/VBG the/DT salmon/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC much/RB less/JJR wait/JJ time/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB busy/JJ ./.
I/PRP just/RB did/VBD n't/RB want/VB that/DT say/NN waiter/NN again/RB ./.

The/DT list/NN of/IN drafts/NNS was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC I/PRP found/VBD a/DT new/JJ favorite/JJ here/RB .../: .Weinstephaner/NNP Vitus/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT oldest/JJS brewery/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/RB place/NN in/IN Wisconsin/NNP the/DT Vitus/NNP brew/NN is/VBZ served/VBN on/IN tap/NN .../: and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ amazing/VBG !/.
Our/PRP$ wait/NN was/VBD about/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS which/WDT was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP got/VBD a/DT great/JJ table/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ loud/JJ in/IN here/RB but/CC full/JJ of/IN energy/NN ,/, maybe/NN do/VBP n't/RB bring/VB your/PRP$ grandma/NN !/.
We/PRP had/VBD their/PRP$ version/NN of/IN a/DT reuben/NN and/CC the/DT macaroni/NN and/CC cheese/NN and/CC both/DT were/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
We/PRP also/RB started/VBD with/IN the/DT pretzels/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP could/MD have/VB skipped/VBN but/CC they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB horrible/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ service/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ and/CC the/DT ambiance/NN is/VBZ cozy/JJ and/CC bustling/NN !/.
Definitely/RB looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO going/VB back/RB !/.
After/IN a/DT recent/JJ bad/JJ experience/NN ,/, the/DT owner/NN of/IN The/DT Coopers/NNP Tavern/NNP reached/VBD out/RP to/TO me/PRP via/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
He/PRP invited/VBD me/PRP back/RB to/TO give/VB them/PRP another/DT chance/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT house/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD BLOWN/NNP AWAY/NNP by/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC their/PRP$ level/NN of/IN service/NN the/DT second/JJ time/NN around/IN ./.

What/NN 's/VBZ more/JJR ,/, every/DT time/NN someone/NN needed/VBD to/TO get/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT space/NN to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT bathroom/NN ,/, those/DT at/IN the/DT table/JJ between/IN them/PRP and/CC the/DT entrance/NN to/TO the/DT snug/NN needed/VBD to/TO get/VB up/RP and/CC step/NN outside/IN the/DT space/NN ,/, then/RB repeat/VB when/WRB they/PRP returned/VBP ./.
What/WP a/DT bad/JJ concept/NN !/.
Service/NN :/: The/DT bartender/NN ,/, who/WP served/VBN us/PRP through/IN a/DT window/NN in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT walls/NNS ,/, seemed/VBD to/TO rely/RB on/IN charm/NN rather/RB than/IN knowledge/NN or/CC good/JJ service/NN ./.
I/PRP indicated/VBD that/IN I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG about/IN having/VBG the/DT reisling/NN with/IN my/PRP$ dinner/NN and/CC asked/VBD if/IN he/PRP thought/VBD that/DT was/VBD a/DT good/JJ pairing/NN ./.

His/PRP$ recommendations/NNS of/IN items/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN seemed/VBD entirely/RB based/VBN upon/IN telling/VBG us/PRP about/IN the/DT awards/NNS that/IN the/DT pub/NN had/VBD gotten/VBN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, being/VBG served/VBN through/IN a/DT window/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT table/JJ meant/NN that/IN all/DT food/NN and/CC drinks/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO be/VB passed/VBN down/RP the/DT table/JJ to/TO those/DT of/IN us/PRP at/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN ;/: the/DT same/JJ with/IN dirty/JJ dishes/glasses/NNS ./.
Annoying/VBG ./.
I/PRP was/VBD SO/NNP glad/CD to/TO leave/VB that/IN noisy/JJ ,/, crowded/JJ ,/, and/CC poorly/RB served/VBN place/NN ./.
I/PRP felt/VBD like/IN I/PRP was/VBD bursting/VBG into/IN freedom/NN as/IN I/PRP left/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
A/DT good/JJ piece/NN of/IN chicken/NN does/VBZ not/RB make/VB up/RP for/IN the/DT unplesantness/NN ./.
Worst/NNP experience/VBD ever/RB tonight/NN !/.
Came/NN here/RB for/IN dinner/NN at/IN 9/CD p.m./NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN the/DT late/JJ night/NN menu/NN started/VBD a/DT bit/NN early/RB ,/, which/WDT we/PRP found/VBD acceptable/JJ ./.

As/IN of/IN right/NN now/RB ,/, 10:25/CD p.m./NN ,/, we/PRP still/RB have/VBP no/DT food/NN ./.

I/PRP tried/VBP their/PRP$ coopers/NNS burger/NN ,/, the/DT combination/NN of/IN beef/NN ,/, pork/NN belly/NN and/CC cheddar/NN is/VBZ really/RB creative/JJ and/CC gives/VBZ it/PRP a/DT nice/JJ finish/JJ ./.

HUGE/NNP noise/NN level/NN on/IN Friday/NNP night/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP a/DT terrific/JJ on/IN tap/NN and/CC drink/NN menu/NN ./.
So/RB many/JJ options/NNS that/IN the/DT only/RB bad/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP simply/RB ca/VBP n't/RB try/VB them/PRP all/DT !/.
After/IN drinks/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ waitress/NN helped/VBD me/PRP decide/VB what/WP I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO get/VB ./.

And/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB reasonably/RB priced/VBN for/IN the/DT quality/NN ./.
Would/NNP recommend/NN taking/VBG advantage/NN of/IN their/PRP$ beer/NN samples/NNS as/IN they/PRP have/VBP a/DT diverse/JJ mix/NN that/WDT are/VBP hard/JJ to/TO find/VB other/JJ places/NNS ./.
Definitely/RB worth/IN the/DT stop/NN !/.
I/PRP love/VBP Cooper/NNP 's/POS Tavern/NNP and/CC always/RB have/VBP ./.
I/PRP am/VBP disappointed/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB the/DT same/JJ reputation/NN that/IN it/PRP used/VBD to/TO on/IN here/RB because/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB feel/VB that/IN the/DT quality/NN has/VBZ changed/VBN ./.

The/DT pretzel/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ burnt/NN on/IN the/DT top/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT sauces/NNS that/WDT were/VBD served/VBN on/IN the/DT side/NN made/VBD up/RP for/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB asking/NN for/IN both/DT the/DT beer/NN cheese/NN and/CC mustard/NN sauce/NN --/: They/PRP are/VBP both/DT worth/JJ trying/VBG ./.
My/NNP salad/VBD was/VBD yummy/JJ and/CC pretty/RB filling/JJ but/CC not/RB over/IN the/DT top/NN ./.
The/DT goat/NN cheese/NN medallions/NNS that/WDT came/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN were/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
Finally/RB ,/, my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN finished/VBD his/PRP$ fried/JJ chicken/NN sandwich/NN before/IN I/PRP could/MD even/RB ask/VB for/IN a/DT bite/NN ./.

Solid/JJ food/NN ,/, solid/JJ menu/NN ,/, good/JJ beer/NN selection/NN ,/, soccer/NN on/IN TV/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB amazing/VBG but/CC it/PRP never/RB disappoints/VBZ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ like/IN your/PRP$ friend/NN who/WP is/VBZ very/RB trustworthy/JJ but/CC not/RB crazy/NN ./.
Supposing/NNP ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, that/IN this/DT friend/NN is/VBZ English/RB ./.

I/PRP was/VBD here/RB a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN ,/, and/CC had/VBD an/DT overall/JJ good/JJ experience/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT Reuben/VBN sandwich/JJ which/WDT was/VBD done/VBN pretty/RB well/RB ./.

The/DT interior/NN is/VBZ really/RB small/JJ ,/, crowded/JJ ,/, and/CC loud/NN ./.
I/PRP purposely/RB avoid/VBP the/DT place/NN when/WRB they/PRP have/VBP live/VBN Irish/JJ music/JJ because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ completely/RB deafening/VBG and/CC makes/VBZ it/PRP impossible/JJ to/TO talk/NN to/TO anyone/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG with/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN friends/NNS ,/, see/VBP if/IN you/PRP can/MD use/VB the/DT snug/NN ;/: it/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN a/DT tiny/NN bar-within-a-bar/NN that/WDT 's/POS walled-in/NN and/CC much/JJ quieter/NN with/IN seating/NN for/IN up/RB to/TO about/IN 8/CD people/NNS ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT tiny/NN window/NN that/WDT opens/NNS onto/VBD the/DT bar/NN ,/, making/VBG it/PRP really/RB easy/JJ to/TO place/NN drink/NN orders/NNS with/IN a/DT bartender/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN wine/NN or/CC mixed/VBN drinks/NNS here/RB ,/, though/IN ;/: the/DT beer/NN selection/NN is/VBZ always/RB too/RB tempting/VBG to/TO pass/VB up/RP ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ really/RB hit-or-miss/JJ ./.
The/DT Belgian/NNP frites/VBZ with/IN malt/NN vinegar/NN aioli/NNS are/VBP crispy/NN and/CC hot/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ hit/NN of/IN salt/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT aioli/NN is/VBZ a/DT perfect/JJ compliment/NN of/IN acidity/NN with/IN a/DT smooth/NN edge/NN ./.
The/DT poutine/NN ,/, although/IN very/RB salty/JJ ,/, is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ winter/NN dish/VB ,/, but/CC far/RB too/RB heavy/JJ for/IN a/DT summer/NN evening/NN ./.
The/DT roasted/VBN bone/NN marrow/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB rich/NN ./.
The/DT overriding/NN taste/NN is/VBZ just/RB pure/JJ fattiness/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP fat/JJ as/RB much/JJ as/IN the/DT next/JJ person/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/NN for/IN more/JJR bread/JJ because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO eat/NN in/IN large/JJ quantities/NNS at/IN once/RB ./.
It/PRP works/VBD better/JJR as/IN a/DT shared/JJ dish/NN ./.
The/DT mussels/NNS du/VBP jour/NN are/VBP a/DT crap/NN shoot/NN ,/, since/IN they/PRP are/VBP prepared/VBN differently/RB every/DT day/NN ./.
I/PRP steer/VBP clear/JJ of/IN the/DT days/NNS when/WRB they/PRP 're/VBP steamed/VBN in/IN beer/NN (/NN especially/RB Guinness/NN )/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP taste/VBP extremely/RB sour/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.

The/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS in/IN the/DT salad/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ and/CC the/DT dressing/NN was/VBD the/DT right/NN amount/NN ./.

I/PRP like/VBP going/VBG to/TO places/NNS where/WRB there/NNS are/VBP n't/RB 25+/JJ things/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
The/DT select/NN menu/NN lists/NNS items/VBP that/IN have/VBP been/VBN perfected/VBN and/CC are/VBP served/VBN fresh/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD there/RB only/RB for/IN beer/NN ./.

The/DT tables/NNS are/VBP small/JJ and/CC very/RB close/JJ together/NN so/IN you/PRP can/MD hear/VB all/PDT the/DT conversations/NNS around/IN you/PRP ./.
The/DT lunch/NN menu/NN was/VBD pretty/RB small/JJ just/RB maybe/JJ 7/NN appetizers/NNS ,/, 10/CD entrees/NNS (/IN all/DT sandwiches/NNS and/CC burgers/NNS )/RB ,/, and/CC some/DT soup/salads/NNS ./.
The/DT price/NN was/VBD pretty/RB fair/JJ for/IN lunch/NN (/NN ~10/CD +/NNS tip/IN )/JJ I/PRP got/VBD the/DT wagyu/NN sliders/NNS because/IN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN wanting/VBG to/TO try/NNP wagyu/NNP beef/NN but/CC honestly../NN its/PRP$ alright../NN
I/PRP like/VBP the/DT bun/NN which/WDT is/VBZ pretzel/NN and/CC it/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT salad/JJ with/IN vingrette/NN dressing/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN with/IN chips/NNS and/CC the/DT portion/NN was/VBD huge/JJ with/IN that/DT ./.

I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB try/VB the/DT beer/NN or/CC drinks/VBZ because/IN it/PRP was/VBD lunch/NN ./.

For/IN me/PRP ,/, that/IN worked/JJ out/NN even/RB better/JJR ./.
Despite/IN being/VBG known/NNS for/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ pub/JJ status/NN ,/, I/PRP actually/RB enjoy/VBP the/DT food/NN more/JJR than/IN the/DT brews/NNS at/IN this/DT locale/NN ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN for/IN dinner/NN and/CC brunch/NN ,/, and/CC both/DT have/VBP tasty/JJ food/NN offerings/NNS ./.

First/NNP ,/, the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN chili/NN was/VBD the/DT perfect/JJ balance/NN of/IN sweet/JJ and/CC spicy/NN for/IN a/DT mid-morning/JJ fix/NN ./.
I/PRP secretly/RB wished/VBD that/IN I/PRP had/VBD just/RB ordered/VBN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN that/DT for/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN ,/, until/IN the/DT poutine/NN came/VBD ./.
The/DT poutine/NN benedict/NN offered/VBD a/DT unique/JJ ,/, vegetarian/JJ spin/NN on/IN a/DT dish/JJ that/NN is/VBZ normally/RB drenched/VBN in/IN gravy/NN ./.
Instead/RB ,/, this/DT place/NN throws/VBZ two/CD poached/VBN eggs/NNS on/IN top/JJ and/CC drizzles/VBZ hollandaise/NN over/IN the/DT fries/NNS ./.
Genuis/NNP !/.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ for/IN any/DT occasion/NN ,/, but/CC personally/RB I/PRP 'd/MD recommend/VB brunch/NN for/IN your/PRP$ first/JJ time/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Monday/NNP evening/NN and/CC enjoyed/VBD a/DT good/JJ Irish/NNP dinner/NN and/CC excellent/JJ music/JJ provided/NN by/IN a/DT traditional/JJ Irish/NNP band/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT pubs/NNS in/IN Ireland/NNP are/VBP laid/JJ back/NNS and/CC casual/JJ just/RB like/IN this/DT and/CC it/PRP brought/VBD back/RB great/JJ memories/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ pub/NN experience/NN in/IN Dublin/NNP ./.
Had/NNP heard/VBD a/DT lot/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, but/CC was/VBD not/RB that/IN good/JJ ./.
Outdoor/NNP seating/VBG seemed/NN exciting/VBG because/IN of/IN capital/NN view/NN but/CC seats/NNS were/VBD uncomfortable/JJ with/IN no/DT back/NN support/NN and/CC kept/VBD bouncing/VBG when/WRB someone/NN got/VBD up/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT busy/NN day/NN so/RB service/NN was/VBD not/RB good/JJ !/.
They/PRP undercooked/VBD our/PRP$ burger/NN and/CC had/VBD to/TO overdo/NN (/NNS never/RB asked/VBD us/PRP how/WRB we/PRP like/IN it/PRP in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN )/NN ./.
You/PRP can/MD probably/RB guess/VB how/WRB much/JJ extra/NN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB !/.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/IN I/PRP keep/VBP trying/VBG ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN the/DT substandard/NN relationship/NN that/WDT wo/MD n't/RB quit/VB ./.
Their/NNP beer/NN selection/NN is/VBZ outstanding/JJ ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ alright/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT food/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT three/CD occasions/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN it/PRP ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN very/RB disappointing/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD not/RB recommend/VB the/DT pretzel/NN breadsticks/VBZ ,/, the/DT reuben/NN (/NN salty/NN and/CC dry/JJ )/NNS ,/, or/CC the/DT poutine/NN (/VBD neither/DT authentic/JJ or/CC good/JJ )/NN ./.

Lesson/NNP :/: Stick/NNP to/TO the/DT beers/NNS ./.

That/DT thing/NN is/VBZ kinda/NN good/NN ./.
4/DT Stars/NNS for/IN the/DT Beer/NNP Options/NNPS ./.

Food/NNP and/CC beer/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ ,/, staff/JJ leaves/NNS something/NN to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ./.
Coopers/NNS is/VBZ always/RB crowded/VBN and/CC noisy/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO ignore/NN when/WRB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.

I/PRP got/VBD the/DT goat/NN cheese/NN polenta/NN -/JJ the/DT veggies/NNS were/VBD doused/VBN in/IN grilling/NN oil/NN and/CC the/DT polenta/NN was/VBD .../: nothing/NN special/NNS ./.

The/DT pork/NN belly/RB --/: it/PRP sounded/VBD wrong/JJ to/TO begin/NN with/IN ,/, but/CC I/PRP thought/VBD ``/`` OK/NNP it/PRP could/MD be/VB brilliant/JJ ''/'' --/: was/VBD really/RB at/IN odds/NNS with/IN the/DT mac/NN ./.
AND/NNP my/NNP mac'n'cheese/NN is/VBZ way/NN better/NN ./.
BUT/NNP ,/, that/DT being/NNP said/VBD .../: Coop/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ a/DT way-cool/JJ place/NN to/TO hang/VB out/RP ./.
:/:
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO like/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP really/RB did/VBD ./.
We/PRP decided/VBD to/TO visit/NN after/IN seeing/VBG that/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT unique/JJ take/NN on/IN different/JJ meals/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD okay/NN and/CC the/DT prices/NNS were/VBD decent/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD very/RB packed/VBN and/CC a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT ``/`` packed/JJ like/IN sardines/NNS ''/'' side/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD again/RB just/RB okay/JJ but/CC I/PRP really/RB expected/VBN more/JJR ./.
The/DT beer/NN selection/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT deal/NN breaker/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT mild/JJ food/NN poisoning/NN that/IN the/DT two/CD out/NNS of/IN the/DT 3/NN of/IN us/PRP received/VBD ./.
The/DT other/JJ guest/NN received/VBD a/DT pretty/JJ bad/JJ case/NN of/IN it/PRP (/-NONE- they/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT fish/JJ and/CC chips/NNS fyi/VBP )/RB My/JJ suggestion/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO stick/NN with/IN the/DT beer/NN or/CC not/RB go/VB at/IN all/DT ./.
Went/NNP to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN on/IN the/DT day/NN after/IN thanksgiving/VBG when/WRB all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ choices/NNS were/VBD closed/VBN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD in/IN ,/, and/CC while/IN seated/VBN right/NN away/RB ,/, took/VBD 15/CD minutes/NNS and/CC us/PRP asking/VBD the/DT waitress/NN 3/CD times/NNS before/IN we/PRP even/RB got/VBD water/NN ./.
The/DT couple/NN that/IN came/NN in/IN 30/CD min/NN after/IN us/PRP got/VBD food/NN and/CC drinks/VBZ before/IN us/PRP ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD poor/JJ ,/, and/CC slow/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB okay/JJ ./.
Edited/VBN on/IN 3/11/12/CD -/JJ gave/NN it/PRP a/DT second/JJ chance/NN -/JJ raised/NN it/PRP to/TO 3/VB stars/NNS instead/RB of/IN two/CD ./.
This/DT time/NN is/VBZ was/VBD much/RB ,/, much/RB better/JJR service/NN ,/, but/CC still/RB 'good/okay/JJ '/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD more/RBR impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT beer/NN list/NN this/DT time/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP consider/JJ going/VBG again/RB for/IN drinks/NNS ./.

So/RB incredibly/RB lucky/JJ to/TO stumble/JJ upon/IN this/DT place/NN our/VBD very/RB first/JJ night/NN in/IN Madison/NNP for/IN work/NN !/.

The/DT plate/NN was/VBD so/RB big/JJ ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB believe/VB I/PRP ate/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD sooooo/RB good/JJ ./.
And/CC did/VBD mention/NN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT regular/JJ menu/NN item/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT special/JJ ?/.
