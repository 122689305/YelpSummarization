The/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB fresh/JJ ,/, but/CC depending/VBG on/IN what/WP you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN .../: .../: it/PRP 's/VBZ more/JJR asian/JJ than/IN vegetarian/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT vegetarian/NN 's/POS restaurant/NN ./.
For/IN a/DT meat/NN eater/NN ,/, not/RB so/RB much/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP wanted/VBD fresh/JJ veggies/NNS so/IN I/PRP thought/VBP I/PRP would/MD finally/RB check/VB out/RP the/DT joint/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT spring/NN rolls/NNS and/CC Pad/NNP Thai/NNP ./.
Love/NNP the/DT spring/NN rolls/NNS !/.
Fresh/JJ veggies/NNS with/IN tofu/NN wrapped/VBD in/IN rice/NN paper/NN and/CC cut/NN into/IN nice/NN pieces/NNS which/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP easy/-NONE- to/TO eat/VB ./.
The/DT peanut/NN sauce/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
Pad/NNP Thai/NNP came/VBD out/RP steaming/VBG hot/NN !/.
However/RB ,/, taste/NN wise/NN I/PRP prefer/VBP a/DT Thai/NNP pad/NN thai/NN ,/, meaning/VBG spicy/NN !/.
Spicy/NNP missing/NN from/IN the/DT noodle/JJ dish/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD still/RB good/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ ,/, and/CC perfectly/RB cooked/VBD veggies/NNS however/RB ,/, it/PRP needed/VBD a/DT kick/NN !/.
Not/RB bad/JJ ,/, I/PRP will/MD still/RB try/VB another/DT dish/JJ there/NN another/DT lunch/NN time/NN ,/, the/DT pho/NN looked/VBD good/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.

I/PRP enjoy/VBP going/VBG here/RB for/IN lunch/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ relatively/RB quick/JJ ,/, conveniently/RB located/VBN and/CC very/RB consistent/JJ ./.
Look/NNP .../: Service/NNP is/VBZ not/RB their/PRP$ strong/JJ suit/NN ,/, good/JJ food/NN is/VBZ ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP could/MD give/VB them/PRP all/DT five/CD stars/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP appears/VBZ the/DT owner/NN takes/VBZ care/NN of/IN everyone/NN himself/NN ./.
When/WRB the/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ full/JJ the/DT service/NN suffers/VBZ a/DT bit/NN ./.
He/PRP makes/VBZ up/RP for/IN it/PRP with/IN a/DT pleasant/JJ demeanor/NN and/CC knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN though/IN so/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ I/PRP would/MD change/VB a/DT thing/NN ./.
My/NNP favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT spring/NN rolls/NNS ./.

Any/NNP of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN are/VBP a/DT home/NN run/NN though/IN ./.
Like/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, overall/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC I/PRP enjoy/VBP it/PRP ./.
Worth/NNP a/DT visit/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN your/PRP$ not/RB vegetarian/JJ ./.
It/PRP definitely/RB crosses/VBZ over/IN to/TO all/DT palates/NNS ./.
Amazing/VBG !/.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN lunch/NN yesterday/NN and/CC returned/NN today/NN (/NNS next/JJ day/NN )/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT fancy/NN place/NN but/CC is/VBZ very/RB clean/JJ ,/, linen/JJ covered/VBN tables/NNS and/CC warm/NN customer/NN service/NN ./.
My/NNP first/JJ experience/NN was/VBD the/DT Green/NNP Mango/NNP salad/NN ./.
Simply/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS things/NNS I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN eaten/JJ ./.

For/IN dinner/NN ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBP Kung/JJ Pao/NNP as/IN my/PRP$ entree/NN and/CC Cucumber/NNP Rolls/NNP for/IN an/DT appetizer/NN ./.
First/NNP ,/, the/DT Cucumber/NNP Rolls/NNP were/VBD insane/NN !/.
I/PRP could/MD have/VB eaten/VBN another/DT order/NN or/CC two/CD !/.
Kung/NNP Pao/NNP is/VBZ their/PRP$ most/JJS popular/JJ dish/JJ and/CC I/PRP can/MD see/VB why/NN ./.
Loved/NNP all/VBD the/DT super/NN fresh/JJ vegetables/NNS ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN !/.
After/IN pondering/VBG whether/NNS or/CC not/RB I/PRP should/MD try/VB this/DT place/NN based/VBN on/IN mixed/NN reviews/NNS I/PRP 'd/MD heard/VB ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO go/VB for/IN it/PRP today/NN !/.
I/PRP am/VBP usually/RB not/RB too/RB into/IN Asian/JJ food/NN (/NN except/IN thai/NNP !/.
)/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD interested/JJ in/IN this/DT completely/JJ vegetarian/JJ place/NN ./.
My/NNP mom/NN did/VBD n't/RB really/RB want/VB to/TO go/VB but/CC she/PRP was/VBD hungry/JJ and/CC we/PRP were/VBD in/IN the/DT area/NN so/RB she/PRP gave/VBD in/IN haha/NN ./.
But/CC she/PRP ended/VBD up/RP loving/VBG it/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP even/RB more/RBR so/RB than/IN I/PRP did/VBD !/.
I/PRP do/VBP have/VBP a/DT few/JJ complaints/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD nothing/VBN too/RB bad/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD very/RB very/RB slow/JJ ./.
Three/JJ people/NNS working/NN and/CC not/RB very/RB many/JJ customers/NNS and/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/NN for/IN quite/RB a/DT bit/NN ./.
Also/RB every/DT single/JJ soda/NN was/VBD out/RP ,/, except/IN diet/JJ coke/NN ./.
Luckily/RB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB drink/VB soda/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT only/JJ thing/NN my/NN mom/NN wanted/NN was/VBD diet/JJ coke/NN !/.
We/PRP seated/VBD ourselves/NNS but/CC a/DT server/NN came/VBD to/TO take/VB our/RP order/NN pretty/RB quickly/RB ./.
Restaurant/NNP was/VBD clean/JJ but/CC nothing/JJ fancy/NN ./.
I/PRP started/VBD off/RP with/IN a/DT jasmine/NN iced/VBN tea/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD tasty/JJ ./.
Subtle/NNP flavor/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD it/PRP ,/, the/DT glass/NN it/PRP came/VBD in/IN was/VBD cool/JJ ,/, almost/RB like/IN a/DT beer/NN glass/NN haha/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN food/NN I/PRP got/VBD the/DT vegetable/JJ curry/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT huge/JJ fan/NN of/IN mock/JJ meat/NN and/CC my/PRP$ mom/NN is/VBZ n't/RB either/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP had/VBD other/JJ options/NNS luckily/RB !/.
My/NNP curry/NN came/VBD with/IN tofu/NN ,/, potatoes/NNS ,/, sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS ,/, I/PRP think/VBP carrots/NNS ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD a/DT side/NN of/IN brown/JJ rice/NN with/IN more/JJR vegetables/NNS ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT vegetables/NNS mixed/VBN with/IN the/DT rice/NN were/VBD almost/RB like/IN cold/NN ,/, was/VBD weird/JJ ./.
Rice/NNP was/VBD n't/RB the/DT best/JJS either/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT curry/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
The/DT perfect/NN amount/NN of/IN spice/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
Plus/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP obsessed/VBN with/IN sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS so/IN that/DT helps/NNS ./.
My/NNP mom/NN got/VBD some/DT kind/NN of/IN dish/JJ that/IN had/VBD eggroll/JJ type/NN things/NNS on/IN top/JJ of/IN noodles/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD both/DT obsessed/VBN with/IN the/DT noodles/NNS and/CC could/MD n't/RB stop/VB eating/JJ them/PRP ./.
We/PRP both/VBP left/VBN feeling/VBG very/RB full/JJ ,/, but/CC glad/JJ to/TO have/VB had/VBN a/DT relatively/RB healthy/JJ meal/NN with/IN lots/NNS of/IN fresh/JJ veggies/NNS and/CC great/JJ flavor/NN ./.

Everything/NN is/VBZ incredibly/RB fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT lemongrass/NN curry/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.

As/IN a/DT vegan/JJ the/DT food/NN is/VBZ spectacular/JJ ,/, the/DT rolls/NNS ,/, the/DT soup/NN the/DT vegan/NN pepper/NN steak/JJ mmmmmm/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP must/MD admit/VB the/DT service/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB awful/JJ expect/NN to/TO wait/VB and/CC wait/VB and/CC wait/VB ./.
Expect/NNP to/TO get/VB thirsty/NN because/IN getting/VBG a/DT drink/NN let/NN alone/VBD a/DT refill/NN is/VBZ nearly/RB impossible/JJ ./.
If/IN the/DT owner/NN is/VBZ working/VBG he/PRP tries/VBZ but/CC always/RB seems/JJ overwhelmed/VBN ./.
If/IN the/DT waitress/NN they/PRP have/VBP is/VBZ working/VBG you/PRP should/MD bring/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ drink/NN and/CC do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB anything/NN more/JJR than/IN a/DT head/NN nod/NN ./.

The/DT staff/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
The/DT server/NN had/VBD great/VBN suggestions/NNS for/IN entrees/NNS ./.

I/PRP gave/VBD it/PRP 2/RB stars/VBZ out/IN of/IN respect/NN for/IN the/DT Yelpers/NNPS that/IN think/NNP it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB great/JJ ,/, but/CC actually/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD rather/RB give/VB it/PRP one/CD ./.
Vegetarian/JJ does/VBZ not/RB have/VB to/TO be/VB bland/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ ./.
Rarely/RB will/MD I/VB write/VBP a/DT negative/JJ review/NN but/CC my/PRP$ experience/NN tonight/NN at/IN Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP makes/VBZ it/PRP necessary/-NONE- ./.
I/PRP have/VBP dined/VBN here/RB three/CD times/NNS prior/RB ,/, all/DT during/IN relatively/RB quiet/JJ hours/NNS ./.
Tonight/NNP ,/, when/WRB dining/JJ with/IN my/NNP family/NN ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD slammed/VBN ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP a/DT small/JJ ,/, family-run/JJ joint/NN ,/, but/CC something/NN 's/POS got/NN ta/NN give/NN !/.
My/NNP gripe/NN is/VBZ not/RB with/IN the/DT food/NN but/CC with/IN the/DT service/NN and/CC the/DT owner/NN 's/POS poor/JJ attitude/NN ./.
During/VBG previous/JJ visits/NNS ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN able/JJ to/TO run/VB the/DT dining/NN room/NN on/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, but/CC tonight/NN he/PRP was/VBD completely/RB in/IN the/DT weeds/NNS ./.
To/TO start/NNS ,/, they/PRP were/VBD out/RB of/IN their/PRP$ imperial/JJ rolls/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP really/RB enjoy/VBP ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD apologetic/JJ but/CC was/VBD also/RB completely/RB harried/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ other/JJ tables/NNS and/CC could/MD barely/RB finish/VB a/DT sentence/NN without/IN being/VBG called/VBN to/TO another/DT set/NN of/IN patrons/NNS ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT last/JJ minute/NN addition/NN to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ when/WRB another/DT family/NN member/NN called/VBD to/TO say/VB he/PRP 'd/MD be/VB joining/VBG us/PRP ./.
We/PRP placed/VBP orders/NNS for/IN appetizers/NNS and/CC soup/VB until/IN he/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO make/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT owner/NN seemed/VBD annoyed/VBN with/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ anyway/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD also/RB a/DT large/JJ party/NN in/IN the/DT dining/JJ room/NN from/IN what/WP seemed/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT radio/NN show/NN that/WDT advertises/NNS for/IN this/DT restaurant/NN (/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT hosts/NNS interrupted/VBD our/PRP$ meal/NN to/TO give/VB us/PRP a/DT flyer/NN about/IN it/PRP )/-NONE- and/CC those/DT patrons/NNS were/VBD loud/VBN and/CC after/IN finishing/VBG their/PRP$ meals/NNS ,/, hovered/VBD other/JJ tables/NNS to/TO chit-chat/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ distracting/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN is/VBZ tremendously/RB loud/JJ and/CC they/PRP play/VBP upbeat/JJ music/NN from/IN the/DT 50/NNP 's/POS and/CC 60/NNP 's/POS ./.
This/DT soundtrack/NN would/MD be/VB fine/VBN during/IN a/DT lunch/NN rush/JJ but/CC not/RB when/WRB people/NNS are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT quiet/JJ dinner/NN with/IN their/PRP$ families/NNS ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ adequate/JJ ./.
A-OK/NNP ,/, even/RB ./.
But/CC the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP outlandish/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ unpleasant/JJ ./.
We/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB returning/VBG as/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ fine/NN ,/, veg-friendly/JJ establishments/NNS in/IN the/DT city/NN deserving/VBG of/IN our/PRP$ business/NN ./.
Delicous/NNP ,/, original/JJ and/CC quaint/JJ ./.
Small/JJ business/NN run/VBZ makes/IN it/PRP feel/VBD personal/JJ ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP it/PRP to/TO anyone/VB looking/NN for/IN cheaply/RB priced/JJ ,/, 100/CD %/NN vegetarian/NN or/CC vegan/NN ,/, Asian/JJ style/JJ food/NN ./.
Double/NNP thumbs/VBZ up/RP !/.

The/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC always/RB quick/JJ !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB 'eaten/VBN in/IN '/NN so/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB speak/VB to/TO that/DT ,/, but/CC quickly/RB becoming/VBD one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ to-go/NN lunch/NN places/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT plant/NN based/VBN eater/NN ,/, or/CC gluten/VB free/JJ ,/, and/CC enjoy/JJ Vietnamese/NNP fare/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN ./.
Side/NNP note-/JJ sometimes/RB this/DT plaza/NN sucks/VBZ to/TO park/NN in/IN ,/, the/DT lanes/NNS legitimately/RB go/VBP certain/JJ ways/NN so/RB make/JJ sure/JJ you/PRP pay/VBP attention/NN to/TO that/DT when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP parking/VBG !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN hit/VBN by/IN 2/CD cars/NNS in/IN that/DT lot/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ 6/CD months/NNS ./.
Their/NNP food/NN is/VBZ normally/RB very/RB good/JJ and/CC I/PRP really/RB like/IN this/DT place/NN a/DT lot/NN ./.
Their/NNP food/NN is/VBZ all/DT vegetarian/JJ and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN it/PRP is/VBZ vegan/JJ or/CC can/MD be/VB made/VBN vegan/JJ ./.
Their/NNP kung/NNP pao/NN soy/NN chicken/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG and/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP gotten/VBN it/PRP more/JJR than/IN once/RB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD there/RB tonight/NN and/CC got/VBD their/PRP$ chow/NN mein/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB gross/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT bowl/NN of/IN water/NN with/IN some/DT sauce/JJ mixed/NN in/IN and/CC noodles/NNS and/CC veggies/NNS ./.
It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN really/RB good/JJ if/IN the/DT bowl/NN was/VBD n't/RB filled/VBN with/IN water/NN ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT waiter/NN if/IN he/PRP could/MD drain/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT water/NN out/NN and/CC he/PRP asked/VBD if/IN I/PRP meant/VBP the/DT sauce/NN ./.
Definitely/RB would/MD n't/RB recommend/VB that/DT dish/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB a/DT while/NN ago/NN and/CC forgot/NN to/TO write/VB a/DT review/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD ok/JJ but/CC not/RB great/JJ ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN was/VBD very/RB sterile/JJ ,/, food/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC service/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD glad/JJ we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB in/IN a/DT rush/JJ as/IN the/DT service/NN definitely/RB was/VBD n't/RB fast/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB again/RB and/CC give/VB it/PRP another/DT try/NN ./.
Eek/NNP !/.
Methinks/NNP not/RB ,/, indeed/RB !/.
Okay/NNP ,/, I/PRP never/RB usually/RB give/VB a/DT place/NN a/DT 1/NN star/NN because/IN I/PRP have/VBP this/DT moral/JJ dilemma/NN with/IN it/PRP .../:
BUT/NNP ,/, I/PRP also/RB never/RB usually/RB walk/VB out/RP of/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN ,/, was/VBD awkwardly/RB greeted/VBN ,/, and/CC told/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT seat/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD lunch/JJ time/NN ,/, so/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD full/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB overflowing/VBG with/IN stressed/VBN out/RP customers/NNS ./.
In/IN all/DT honesty/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT typical/JJ lunchtime/NN scenario/NN inside/NN ./.
*I/NNP 'd/NNP also/RB like/IN to/TO note/NN that/IN I/PRP read/VBP reviews/NNS for/IN slower/JJR than/IN average/JJ service/NN ,/, so/IN I/PRP was/VBD prepared/VBN to/TO wait/VB a/DT little/JJ extra/NN to/TO try/VB the/DT food*/NN Once/IN I/PRP sat/VBP down/RB ,/, I/PRP noticed/VBD the/DT server/NN bringing/VBG menus/NN over/IN to/TO the/DT patrons/NNS that/WDT entered/VBN immediately/RB before/IN me/PRP ,/, but/CC he/PRP never/RB came/VBD over/IN with/IN one/CD for/IN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO patiently/RB wait/VB for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD minutes/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ when/WRB I/PRP started/VBP overhearing/VBG the/DT conversation/NN at/IN the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO me/PRP ,/, and/CC to/TO sum/VB it/PRP up/IN :/: I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN we/PRP can/MD stay/VB and/CC eat/VB ,/, we/PRP might/MD have/VB to/TO get/VB it/PRP to/TO go../VB We/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN waiting/VBG a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
Again/NNP ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB verbatim/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ exactly/RB along/IN those/DT lines/NNS ./.
I/PRP figured/VBD the/DT reviews/NNS were/VBD right/RB about/IN the/DT food/NN prep/NN times/NNS ,/, and/CC continued/VBD to/TO wait/NN ./.
After/IN a/DT few/JJ more/RBR minutes/NNS passed/VBD by/IN ,/, another/DT couple/NN walked/VBD in/IN ,/, were/VBD acknowledged/JJ and/CC seated/JJ ,/, and/CC after/IN a/DT minute/NN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD given/VBN menus/NNS (/RB This/DT is/VBZ about/IN 8-10/CD minutes/NNS in/IN )/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD then/RB that/IN the/DT server/NN came/VBD over/RP with/IN water/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ couple/NN that/WDT had/VBD walked/VBN in/IN before/NNP me/NNP ./.
He/PRP then/RB walked/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT drink/NN area/NN and/CC brought/VBD out/RP two/CD more/JJR glasses/NNS of/IN water/NN for/IN the/DT couple/NN that/IN came/NN in/IN almost/RB ten/VBN minutes/NNS after/IN me/PRP ./.
With/IN no/DT menu/NN ,/, water/NN or/CC sense/NN of/IN appreciation/NN for/IN wanting/NN to/TO spend/VB my/JJ money/NN at/IN Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP ,/, I/PRP got/VBD up/RP and/CC walked/VBD out/RP ./.
A/DT good/JJ way/NN to/TO lose/VB a/DT customer/NN is/VBZ to/TO not/RB serve/VB them/PRP ./.
With/IN service/NN complaints/NNS since/IN 2008/CD on/IN Yelp/NNP ,/, I/PRP really/RB think/VBP something/NN needs/NNS to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.
That/DT was/VBD unbelievably/RB insulting/VBG ./.
Probably/RB my/VBD favorite/JJ vegan/JJ friendly/RB place/NN in/IN all/DT of/IN Phoenix/NNP right/NN now/RB ./.
Very/NNP very/RB clean/JJ ,/, nice/JJ looking/NN restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT owners/NNS were/VBD so/RB sweet/JJ and/CC catering/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP Pho/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN and/CC was/VBD just/RB blown/JJ away/NN ./.
Everything/IN else/RB I/PRP ordered/VBP was/VBD also/RB amazing/VBG like/IN the/DT fried/JJ bananas/NN and/CC Thai/NNP tea/NN ./.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO come/VB back/RB

I/PRP usually/VBP like/IN my/PRP$ salad/JJ served/VBN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN lettuce/NN and/CC enough/RB other/JJ junk/NN to/TO qualify/VB it/PRP as/IN not/RB so/RB healthy/JJ (/NN hello/NN ,/, blue/JJ cheese/NN !/NN )/NN ./.
This/DT salad/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB leave/VB me/PRP missing/JJ anything/NN ./.
The/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP was/VBD n't/RB as/RB spicy/JJ as/IN I/PRP usually/RB like/IN ,/, but/CC the/DT broccoli/NN on/IN top/JJ made/VBN up/RP for/IN it/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB asian/JJ no/DT other/JJ choices/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP vegetarian/JJ as/IN I/PRP do/VBP occasionally/RB eat/VB eggs/NNS and/CC cheese/NN but/CC this/DT place/NN did/VBD not/RB impress/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT kabobs/NNS and/CC they/PRP were/VBD saturated/VBN in/IN a/DT thick/NN sauce/NN that/WDT smelled/VBD burnt/JJ as/IN if/IN they/PRP scalded/VBD it/PRP while/IN cooking/NN ./.

The/DT name/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ mint/NN however/RB I/PRP did/VBD not/RB see/VB many/JJ mint/NN items/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD in/IN a/DT hurry/NN and/CC got/VBD a/DT to/TO go/VB order/NN off/IN the/DT $/$ 8/CD lunch/NN menu/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN has/VBZ many/JJ options/NNS for/IN traditional/JJ veggie/NN favorites/VBZ to/TO some/DT with/IN fake/NN meat/NN ./.

Brown/NNP rice/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN (/VBD a/DT nice/JJ no/DT charge/NN up/IN grade/NN )/NN and/CC a/DT small/JJ salad/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP was/VBD all/DT sort/NN of/IN lackluster/NN and/CC boring/NN ./.
It/PRP just/RB seemed/VBD like/IN something/NN you/PRP could/MD get/VB anywhere/RB ./.
Cute/NNP little/VBD place/NN !/.
The/DT owner/NN serves/VBZ you/PRP himself/PRP and/CC everything/NN is/VBZ made/VBN fresh/JJ to/TO order/NN ./.

The/DT service/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB enough/RB and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ Yummers/NNS but/CC my/PRP$ gripe/NN is/VBZ the/DT pricing/NN :/: p/VB $/$ 14/CD for/IN a/DT veggie/NN hot/NN pot/NN ?/. ?/.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, ca/MD n't/RB complain/VB but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB hard/JJ to/TO see/VB where/WRB they/PRP justify/VBP this/DT kind/NN of/IN pricing/NN ./.

I/PRP call/VBP in/IN to/TO make/VB an/DT order/NN for/IN pickup/NN so/IN I/PRP can/MD quickly/RB grab/VB it/PRP and/CC go/VB back/RB to/TO work/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT cucumber/NN rolls/NNS and/CC the/DT lotus/NN salad/NN ./.
The/DT lady/NN on/IN the/DT phone/NN told/VBD me/PRP it/PRP would/MD take/VB about/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
So/IN I/PRP drove/VBP 15/JJ minutes/NNS to/TO the/DT location/NN to/TO find/VB that/IN they/PRP never/RB started/VBD on/IN my/PRP$ order../NN okay/NN no/DT big/JJ deal/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB easy/JJ thing/NN to/TO prepare/NN ./.

I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP being/VBG there/RB for/IN almost/RB 30/CD minutes/NNS ./.
While/IN the/DT staff/NN argued/VBD back/RB and/CC forth/RB about/IN what/WP my/PRP$ order/NN actually/RB was/VBD ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB until/IN the/DT woman/NN who/WP took/VBD my/NN order/NN finally/RB told/VBD them/PRP what/WP it/PRP was/VBD ./.
So/RB after/IN all/DT that/IN I/PRP received/VBD my/PRP$ order/NN ./.

The/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP is/VBZ awesome/JJ and/CC everyone/NN 's/POS right/NN -/NN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB miss/VB the/DT chicken/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT veg-head/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP enjoy/RB a/DT good/JJ tofu/NN dish/VB ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN brown/JJ rice/NN ,/, huge/JJ plus/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB the/DT slow/NN service/NN nor/CC the/DT ghetto/NN salad/NN ./.

Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP offers/VBZ a/DT very/RB consistent/JJ product/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT vegetarian/JJ restaurant/NN with/IN a/DT Kosher/NNP designationl/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ Asian/JJ ,/, with/IN traditional/JJ dishes/NNS served/VBN with/IN tofu/NN or/CC just/RB veggies/NNS ./.
The/DT tofu/NN is/VBZ flavored/shaped/VBN as/IN with/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ more/JJR traditional/JJ dish/JJ (/NN i.e/NN ./.
Kung/NNP Poa/NNP has/VBZ chicken-flavored/VBN tofu/NN ,/, Beef/NNP dishes/VBZ taste/JJ more/RBR like/IN beef/NN )/NN ./.
Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP prefer/VBP plain/NN tofu/NN over/IN flavored/VBN and/CC they/PRP will/MD substitute/VB to/TO your/PRP$ taste/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, for/IN GF'ers/NNS ,/, they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP some/DT dishes/NNS that/WDT are/VBP GF/NNP (/NNP no/DT soy/NN sauce/NN --/: such/JJ as/IN curries/NNS )/NNS ./.
No/DT upcharges/NNS for/IN any/DT subs/NNS or/CC even/RB brown/JJ rice/NN .../: At/IN lunch/NN ,/, hardly/RB a/DT seat/NN is/VBZ available/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ more/RBR crowded/JJ than/IN the/DT fast/NN food/NN joint/NN that/WDT is/VBZ closer/NN to/TO the/DT street/NN ./.
A/DT slight/NN tention/NN can/MD be/VB felt/VBN for/IN the/DT business/NN of/IN the/DT staff/NN ;/: however/RB ,/, this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ consistant/JJ every/DT time/NN .../: it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ trying/VBG folks/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD compelled/VBN to/TO try/VB Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP based/NN on/IN its/PRP$ healthy/JJ and/CC appetizing/VBG menu/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO report/NN that/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
While/IN the/DT pictures/NNS on/IN the/DT internet/NN led/VBD me/PRP to/TO believe/VB the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD more/JJR upscale/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT clean/JJ and/CC cozy/JJ space/NN located/VBD in/IN one/CD of/IN Scottsdale/NNP 's/POS many/JJ strip/NN malls/NNS ./.
I/PRP started/VBD off/RP dinner/NN with/IN an/DT appetizer/NN of/IN cucumber/JJR rolls/NNS -/JJ light/NN and/CC tasty/NN ./.
For/IN my/PRP$ entree/NN ,/, I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT curry/JJ apple/NN tofu/NN with/IN brown/JJ rice/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD flavorful/JJ and/CC filling/JJ ./.
The/DT portion/NN size/NN was/VBD just/RB right/RB ./.
Against/RB my/VBD better/RBR judgment/NN (/NN as/IN I/PRP mentioned/VBD ,/, the/DT entree/NN was/VBD filling/VBG )/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD in/IN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
The/DT coconut/NN mango/NN tapioca/NN could/MD have/VB been/VBN skipped/VBN ./.
The/DT flavor/NN was/VBD okay/JJ but/CC the/DT consistency/NN was/VBD runny/JJ for/IN my/PRP$ tastes/NNS ./.
Overall/IN ,/, I/PRP found/VBD Fresh/JJ Mint/NNP delightful/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD extremely/RB attentive/JJ and/CC personable/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB return/VB when/WRB I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN town/NN ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP is/VBZ calling/VBG my/PRP$ name/NN and/CC I/PRP shall/MD answer/VB yet/RB again/RB !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN there/RB numerous/JJ times/NNS and/CC everything/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN has/VBZ been/VBN wonderful/JJ !/.
My/NNP favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT green/JJ papaya/NN salad/NN ,/, mmm/NN crunchy/NN peanut-y/JJ scrumptiousness/NN !/.
Very/NNP tasty/NN ./.
A/DT bit/JJ pricey/NN for/IN the/DT portion/NN sizes/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ n't/RB unusual/JJ for/IN this/DT neighborhood/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN a/DT little/JJ casual/JJ placer/NN like/IN this/DT ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT only/RB vegan/JJ restaurant/NN on/IN this/DT side/NN of/IN town/NN so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP craving/VBG a/DT fresh/JJ ,/, non-meaty/JJ treat/NN ./.
Best/NNP veg/VBD food/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP -/NNP my/NNP boyfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP are/VBP addicted/VBN to/TO the/DT five/CD spice/NN noodle/JJ soup/NN !/.

The/DT owner/NN is/VBZ always/RB kind/JJ and/CC gracious/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ super/NN fresh/NN ,/, and/CC feels/NNS good/JJ to/TO eat/NN ./.
Mint/NNP tomatoes/NNS was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
Summer/NNP roles/NNS were/VBD ok./RB And/CC the/DT island/NN salad/NN was/VBD soaked/VBN in/IN dressing/NN and/CC missing/NN 2/NN of/IN the/DT few/JJ ingredients/NNS (/VBP candied/VBN walnuts/NNS and/CC dried/VBD cranberries/NNS )/RB ./.

Nice/NNP place/NN ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD a/DT teeny/NN bit/NN less/JJR than/IN expected/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT price/NN was/VBD fair/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Very/NNP nice/NNP man/NNP served/VBD us/PRP and/CC kept/VBD the/DT refills/NNS comin/VBP '/NN ./.
Every/NNP potential/VBD new/JJ favorite/JJ vegan/NN place/NN is/VBZ worth/VBG a/DT shot/NN as/IN far/JJ as/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP concerned/VBN ,/, and/CC Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB ./.
Healthy/NNP and/CC delicious/JJ does/VBZ n't/RB always/RB go/VB together/RB but/CC at/IN the/DT Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP it/PRP describes/VBZ most/RBS if/IN not/RB all/DT of/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Rainbow/NNP Veggies/NNPS with/IN brown/JJ rice/NN along/NN with/IN the/DT sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ soup/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD scrumptious/JJ ./.

When/WRB I/PRP finally/RB made/VBD it/PRP there/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD slightly/VBN surprised/VBN by/IN what/WP I/PRP found/VBP ./.
The/DT ambiance/NN is/VBZ somewhat/JJ odd/JJ ,/, and/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT ``/`` odd/JJ but/CC quirky/JJ and/CC cool/NN ''/'' sense/IN you/PRP get/VBP from/IN other/JJ vegan/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBN kind/NN of/IN a/DT strip/NN mall/NN chic/NN feel/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, and/CC the/DT fifties/NNS music/JJ playing/NN in/IN the/DT background/NN made/VBD me/PRP feel/IN like/IN I/PRP got/VBD dropped/RB in/IN some/DT bizarro/NN ``/`` Back/NNP to/TO the/DT Future/NN ''/'' scene/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC the/DT couple/NN that/IN owns/VBZ the/DT place/NN was/VBD really/RB friendly/RB !/.
I/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Tuesday/NNP evening/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD the/DT only/RB one/CD there/NN --/: the/DT place/NN was/VBD dead/JJ ./.
It/PRP gave/VBD me/PRP pause/VB at/IN first/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT appetizer/NN I/PRP ordered/VBP (/JJ Fried/JJ Imperial/NNP Rolls/NNP )/NNP was/VBD excellent/JJ ,/, although/IN the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD small/JJ ./.
The/DT vegetarian/JJ dipping/NN sauce/NN (/NN whatever/NN that/WDT is/VBZ )/NN was/VBD especially/RB good/JJ ./.
For/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN I/PRP ordered/VBP Golden/VBN Soy/NNP Chicken/NNP --/: and/CC although/IN it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN the/DT same/JJ rubbery/NN soy/NN chicken/NN substitute/NN you/PRP might/MD buy/VB at/IN the/DT grocery/NN store/NN ,/, it/PRP actually/RB tasted/VBD like/IN chicken/NN !/.
The/DT scrumptious/JJ citrusy/NN ginger/NN flavor/NN of/IN the/DT sauce/JJ really/NN made/VBD the/DT dish/JJ ,/, though/IN ./.
The/DT veggies/NNS seemed/VBD a/DT bit/NN more/RBR for/IN garnish/JJ than/IN for/IN actual/JJ consumption/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD ok/JJ ,/, too/RB ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN I/PRP give/VBP 4/JJ stars/NNS instead/RB of/IN 5/CD ?/.
You/PRP pay/VBP too/RB much/RB for/IN the/DT size/NN portions/NNS you/PRP get/VB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD an/DT appetizer/NN and/CC an/DT entree/NN and/CC I/PRP still/RB left/VBD not/RB quite/JJ full/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP thinking/VBG I/PRP 'll/MD have/VB to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN for/IN lunch/NN sometime/NN ,/, since/IN I/PRP work/VBP only/RB right/RB down/IN the/DT road/NN ./.
We/PRP literally/RB live/VBP around/IN the/DT corner/NN and/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO LOVE/NNP this/DT place/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO just/RB like/IN it/PRP ./.
You/PRP definitely/RB get/VBP a/DT mix/NN of/IN great/JJ cooked/JJ food/NN or/CC ok/NN bland/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ what/WP you/PRP order/NN ,/, or/CC who/WP 's/POS cooking/NN ,/, or/CC maybe/NN when/WRB you/PRP go/VBP ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP a/DT bit/JJ inconsistent/NN ./.
When/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ on/IN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN IS/VBD a/DT little/JJ funny/NN ,/, and/CC since/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ such/JJ a/DT small/JJ place/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO deal/NN with/IN a/DT personality/NN ./.
Just/NNP roll/NN with/IN it/PRP .../VBD service/NN is/VBZ always/RB good/JJ when/WRB someone/NN means/VBZ well/RB !/.
I/PRP still/RB go/VBP regularly/RB ,/, but/CC always/RB with/IN a/DT ``/`` we/PRP 'll/MD see/VB what/WP we/PRP get/VBP ''/'' feeling/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ never/RB bad/JJ ,/, so/RB I/PRP disagree/VBP with/IN the/DT 1star/CD review/NN ./.

Another/DT gripe/NN is/VBZ with/IN price/NN and/CC vegetarian/JJ spots/NNS in/IN general/JJ ./.
Usually/RB meat/NN is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS expensive/JJ item/NN in/IN a/DT dish/JJ ./.
If/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT meat/NN then/RB the/DT restaurants/NNS costs/NNS are/VBP lower/JJR (/NNS not/RB to/TO mention/NN storage/NN and/CC handling/NN savings/NNS )/VBP so/RB this/DT should/MD be/VB passed/VBN on/IN to/TO the/DT consumer/NN ./.

(/IN Speaking/NN of/IN the/DT chef/NN ,/, she/PRP 's/VBZ Vietnamese/NNP and/CC makes/VBZ a/DT killer/NN Pho/NNP )/NNP But/CC really/NNP ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ smoothies/NNS and/CC coffee/NN are/VBP so/RB worth/RB ./.

Even/RB though/IN no/DT one/CD cares/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ personal/JJ favorite/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ pad/JJ thai/NN and/CC vegetable/JJ spring/NN rolls/NNS :/: )/JJ
It/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ expensive/JJ (/NN $/$ 60/CD with/IN tip/NN for/IN two/CD for/IN lunch/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT cucumber/NN rolls/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, they/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT really/RB tasty/JJ peanut/NN sauce/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT main/JJ dishes/NNS were/VBD a/DT disappointment/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN ,/, not/RB very/RB flavorful/JJ ,/, something/NN I/PRP could/MD whip/VB up/RP at/IN home/NN on/IN a/DT week/NN day/NN ./.

Surprisingly/RB good/JJ ./.
Never/NNP had/VBD a/DT piece/NN of/IN soy/NN with/IN so/RB much/JJ flavor/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP a/DT large/JJ gluten/NN free/JJ menu/NN that/IN I/PRP was/VBD very/RB impressed/VBN with/IN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT autumn/NN roll/NN ,/, sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ soup/NN ,/, lemongrass/NN curry/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT coconut/NN tapioca/NN for/IN desert/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD GREAT/NNP !/.
My/NNP favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT soup/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN at/IN around/IN 6:30pm/CD ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD n't/RB full/JJ but/CC had/VBD a/DT good/JJ amount/NN of/IN people/NNS ./.

After/IN that/DT ,/, the/DT service/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP quickly/RB and/CC the/DT server/NN was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ./.
To/TO be/VB fair/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD person/NN taking/VBG the/DT orders/NNS and/CC another/DT running/VBG the/DT food/NN ./.
Definitely/NNP will/MD be/VB coming/VBG back/RB here/RB because/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB top/JJ notch/NN ./.

Went/NNP for/IN some/DT vegan/JJ food/NN ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ entirely/RB vegan/JJ except/NN for/IN the/DT two/CD dessert/NN cakes/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB eating/VBG dessert/NN ,/, the/DT entire/JJ menu/NN was/VBD vegan/JJ ./.
No/DT animal/JJ products/NNS enter/VBP the/DT kitchen/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT kung/NN pao/NN chicken/NN and/CC soy/JJ beef/NN and/CC both/DT were/VBD absolutely/RB amazing/JJ ,/, with/IN the/DT only/JJ criticism/NN being/VBG that/IN they/PRP were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ salty/NN ./.

The/DT pad/NN thai/RB had/VBD nice/JJ fresh/JJ veggies/NNS and/CC was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT curry/NN was/VBD much/JJ better/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ spicy/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP like/IN ,/, and/CC was/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB a/DT coconut/NN milk/NN curry/JJ (/NN or/CC had/VBD very/RB little/JJ )/NN so/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ different/NN from/IN most/JJS Thai/NNP green/NNP curries/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ,/, but/CC I/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB clear/JJ they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB enough/JJ staff/NN to/TO handle/VB everything/NN effectively/RB ./.
In/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT ambience/NN ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD n't/RB super/JJ clean/NN ./.

The/DT furniture/NN and/CC decor/NN were/VBD pretty/RB outdated/VBN too/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN tasted/VBD great/JJ and/CC I/PRP actually/RB would/MD return/VB because/IN it/PRP really/RB was/VBD good/JJ ./.

Not/RB the/DT biggest/JJS portions/NNS ,/, especially/RB since/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB on/IN the/DT lunch/NN menu/NN ,/, cost/VBD $/$ 11.95/CD ,/, and/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB enough/VBN for/IN left/VBN overs/NNS ./.
My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT kung/NN pao/NN soy/NN chicken/NN which/WDT was/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ ./.

They/PRP are/VBP from/IN Hawaii/NNP and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN is/VBZ a/DT warm/NN ,/, friendly/RB ,/, welcoming/VBG environment/NN for/IN everyone/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD high/JJ quality/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN reasonable/JJ prices/NNS and/CC was/VBD very/RB filling/JJ ./.
I/PRP eat/VBP ALOT/RB so/RB that/IN was/VBD imporatant/JJ to/TO me/PRP as/IN I/PRP sometimes/VBP leave/JJ vegan/NN restaurants/NNS still/RB hungry/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD also/RB feel/VB very/RB comfortable/JJ taking/IN all/DT of/IN my/PRP$ carnivore/NN friends/NNS to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN as/IN I/PRP believe/VBP they/PRP would/MD be/VB unable/JJ to/TO tell/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN the/DT delicious/JJ vegan/NN protien/NN (/VBD faux/NN meat/NN )/NN and/CC the/DT real/JJ thing/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP will/MD be/VB hosting/VBG our/PRP$ carnivore/NN friends/NNS for/IN Thanksgiving/NNP and/CC offering/NNP prepared/NNP food/NN from/IN this/DT restaurant/NN as/IN an/DT option/NN at/IN dinner-/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN tasty/NN !/.
The/DT chef/NN 's/POS husband/NN personally/RB delivered/JJ our/JJ food/NN ,/, was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC initiated/VBD very/RB nice/JJ conversation/NN with/IN my/PRP$ partner/NN and/CC I/PRP ./.
We/PRP truly/VBP felt/JJ welcomed/JJ and/CC will/MD be/VB returning/VBG weekly/RB unless/IN something/NN can/MD beat/VB this/DT !/NN
It/PRP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP very/RB little/JJ time/NN on/IN here/RB to/TO write/VB reviews/NNS and/CC specifically/RB joined/VBD this/DT site/NN because/IN I/PRP felt/VBP so/RB strongly/RB about/IN promoting/VBG this/DT restaurant/NN through/IN an/DT online/NN review/NN that/IN I/PRP created/VBD an/DT account/NN !/.
Give/NNP it/PRP a/DT try/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB disappointed/VBN !/.
A/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP had/VBD asked/VBN me/PRP to/TO go/VB to/TO a/DT vegetarian/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB laughed/VBN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB dragged/JJ ,/, I/PRP went/VBD willingly/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP ./.
The/DT flavors/NNS were/VBD wonderful/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT combination/NN of/IN seasonings/NNS in/IN the/DT various/JJ dishes/NNS we/PRP tried/VBP were/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
We/PRP also/RB split/VBD the/DT Banana/NNP desert/NN ,/, delicious/JJ ./.
Go/NNP for/IN a/DT change/NN of/IN pace/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB unique/JJ
Vegans/NNS and/CC Vegetarians/NNS alike/VBP should/MD find/VB plenty/NN of/IN options/NNS here/RB !/.
My/NNP daughter/NN and/CC I/PRP shared/VBD a/DT large/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lemongrass/NNP Soup/NNP plus/VBZ an/DT order/NN of/IN Pad/NNP Thai/NNP ./.
Both/DT were/VBD beautifully/RB presented/JJ ,/, generous/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB next/JJ time/NN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN Phoenix/NNP !/.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN coming/VBG here/RB a/DT long/JJ time/NN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB comfortable/JJ returning/NN because/IN I/PRP am/VBP put/VBN off/RP by/IN the/DT owners/NNS harsh/JJ demeanor/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB time/VBN to/TO deal/NN with/IN his/PRP$ nasty/JJ attitude/NN ./.
The/DT wife/NN is/VBZ so/RB lovely/RB and/CC sweet/JJ but/CC her/PRP husband/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO run/VB this/DT business/NN into/IN the/DT ground/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT real/JJ shame/NN because/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ and/CC healthy/JJ even/RB though/IN the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB outrageous.There/RB just/RB are/VBP n't/RB enough/RB healthy/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP he/PRP would/MD take/VB these/DT reviews/NNS about/IN the/DT bad/JJ customer/NN service/NN into/IN consideration/NN and/CC change/NN his/PRP$ attitude/NN or/CC hire/VB a/DT manager/NN if/IN he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB like/VB working/NN in/IN the/DT service/NN industry/NN ./.
Attitude/NN is/VBZ everything/NN and/CC although/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ descent/JJ I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO have/VB to/TO feel/NNS like/IN i/NN am/NN burdening/NN someone/NN to/TO take/VB my/NN order/NN ./.
Sorry/NNP guys/VBZ I/PRP hope/VBP you/PRP fire/VB your/PRP$ husband/NN or/CC the/DT business/NN will/MD fail/VB ./.
Having/VBG heard/NN many/JJ fantastic/JJ reviews/NNS ,/, I/PRP was/VBD eager/JJ to/TO make/VB the/DT 40/NN minute/NN trek/NN from/IN Old/NNP Town/NNP to/TO Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP for/IN some/DT delicious/JJ vegetarian/JJ food/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, after/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD confidently/RB say/VB that/IN I/PRP would/MD n't/RB come/VB back/RB to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN even/RB if/IN it/PRP were/VBD 5/VBN minutes/NNS away/RB ./.
To/TO begin/NNS ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD empty/NN and/CC our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD sitting/VBG at/IN a/DT table/JJ reading/NN a/DT book/NN when/WRB we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN ./.
She/PRP seemed/VBD peeved/VBN that/IN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, and/CC dropped/VBD the/DT menus/NN on/IN the/DT table/JJ without/IN a/DT single/JJ greeting/NN ./.
After/IN taking/JJ our/NNS order/NN (/VBZ pad/JJ thai/NN and/CC colorful/JJ vegetables/NNS )/IN she/PRP went/VBD behind/IN the/DT counter/NN and/CC played/VBN on/IN her/PRP phone/NN for/IN the/DT entire/JJ duration/NN of/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN ./.
Not/RB fantastic/JJ service/NN ./.
In/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT food/NN :/: The/DT sauce/NN in/IN both/DT dishes/NNS was/VBD too/RB sweet/JJ to/TO eat/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB bland/JJ and/CC lacked/JJ flavor/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO yell/JJ across/IN the/DT restaurant/NN to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ server/NN 's/POS attention/NN for/IN sriacha/NN ,/, and/CC when/WRB she/PRP brought/VBD it/PRP to/TO the/DT table/JJ ,/, there/EX was/VBD only/RB a/DT teaspoon/NN of/IN sriacha/NN in/IN the/DT ramekin/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, I/PRP frequent/VBD many/JJ restaurants/NNS and/CC I/PRP myself/VBP work/NN in/IN the/DT industry/NN ,/, so/RB I/RB know/VBP what/WP good/JJ food/NN and/CC good/JJ service/NN is/VBZ ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP lacked/VBD in/IN both/DT of/IN these/DT areas/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT shame/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP into/IN healthy/JJ ,/, vegetarian/JJ &/CC vegan/JJ food/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ most/RBS definitely/RB your/PRP$ spot/NN !/.
The/DT ingredients/NNS are/VBP always/RB fresh/JJ ,/, seasoned/JJ well/RB ,/, and/CC cooked/VBD to/TO perfection/NN ./.
It/PRP could/MD use/VB a/DT facelift/NN &/CC some/DT better/RBR decor-/JJ especially/RB if/IN we/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG by/IN N./NNP Scottsdale/NNP standards-/NN but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB find/VB any/DT fault/NN with/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
Faves/NNS :/: Summer/NNP rolls/NNS (/VBP the/DT peanut/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ TO/NNP DIE/NNP FOR/NNP )/NNP ,/, soy/JJ lemongrass/NN beef/NN ,/, pad/RB thai/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT imperial/JJ rolls/NNS are/VBP absolutely/RB delish/JJ !/.
Ca/NNP n't/RB recommend/VB this/DT place/NN enough/RB !/.
Very/NNP nice/NNP and/CC reasonable/JJ place/NN !/.
Food/NNP is/VBZ made/VBN fresh/JJ and/CC they/PRP can/MD accomodate/VB my/PRP$ no/DT onion/no/NN garlic/NN diet/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ rare/JJ ./.
Good/NNP size/NNP portions/NNS and/CC quick/NN service/NN
Kosher/NNP and/CC vegetarian/JJ ./.
A/DT definite/JJ plus/NN ./.
The/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP delicious/JJ and/CC the/DT staff/NN are/VBP very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
The/DT servings/NNS though/RB ,/, in/IN comparison/NN to/TO their/PRP$ price/NN ,/, are/VBP quite/JJ small/JJ and/CC disappointing/JJ ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBD an/DT appetizer/NN for/IN $/$ 6/CD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN as/IN 6/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN raw/NN vegetables/NNS with/IN a/DT small/JJ cup/NN of/IN peanut/NN sauce/NN ./.
Main/NNP dish/JJ servings/NNS are/VBP approximately/RB a/DT heaping/JJ cup/NN of/IN food/NN ./.
For/IN a/DT small/JJ break/NN ,/, try/VBD the/DT lunch/NN menu/NN for/IN an/DT array/NN of/IN their/PRP$ popular/JJ dishes/NNS for/IN $/$ 8/CD each/CD ./.
Servings/NNS are/VBP still/RB small/JJ ./.
Great/NNP place/NNP !/.
Really/RB good/JJ food/NN that/WDT tastes/NNS like/IN authentic/JJ meat/NN and/CC friendly/RB staff/VBD with/IN great/JJ service/NN !/.
As/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT group/NN (/IN 5/JJ people/NNS )/IN we/PRP each/VBP ordered/VBN different/JJ dishes/NNS and/CC from/IN the/DT appetizers/NNS and/CC soups/NNS to/TO the/DT mains/NNS .../: each/DT of/IN us/PRP were/VBD impressed/VBN not/RB only/RB with/IN the/DT flavors/NNS but/CC also/RB the/DT plating/NN ./.
Presentation/NNP was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC not/RB at/IN all/DT what/WP we/PRP expected/VBP from/IN a/DT place/NN in/IN a/DT strip/NN mall/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD good/JJ not/RB great/JJ but/CC they/PRP were/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC so/RB I/PRP would/MD rather/RB focus/VB on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT willingness/NN they/PRP had/VBD to/TO deliver/NN great/JJ meals/NNS ./.
At/IN one/CD point/NN we/PRP ordered/VBP another/DT autumn/NN roll/NN and/CC they/PRP immediately/RB got/VBD that/IN out/IN so/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB end/VB up/RP with/IN mains/NNS and/CC that/IN .../: we/PRP all/DT agreed/NN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB back/RB to/TO ./.
Even/RB the/DT meat/NN eaters/NNS loved/VBD the/DT selection-/NN
I/PRP absolutely/RB love/JJ this/DT place/NN ,/, and/CC would/MD recommend/VB it/PRP to/TO anyone/VB !/.
It/PRP is/VBZ Vegan/NNP ,/, and/CC everything/NN I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN has/VBZ been/VBN excellent/JJ at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN !/.
4/DT stars/NNS for/IN :/: healthy/JJ ,/, vegan/JJ ,/, TONS/NNP of/IN options/NNS ,/, something/NN for/IN the/DT noodle/JJ person/NN and/CC something/NN for/IN the/DT salad/JJ person/NN ,/, lunch/NN special/NN options/NNS and/CC a/DT gluten-free/JJ menu/NN ./.
Mostly/RB for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ vegan/JJ and/CC does/VBZ n't/RB do/VB all/DT crappy/NN vegan/JJ processed/VBN food/NN .../:
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB twice/JJ and/CC both/DT times/NNS ordered/VBD carry/VB out/RP -/JJ first/JJ time/NN was/VBD so/RB long/RB ago/IN that/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB recall/VB what/WP I/PRP had/VBD besides/VBZ a/DT thai/NN iced/VBN tea/NN ./.
Today/IN I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN their/PRP$ Fresh/JJ Mint/NNP Salad/NNP (/VBD $/$ 8/CD )/CD ,/, and/CC I/PRP wanted/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB more/RBR traditional/JJ Vietnamese/NN so/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP vermicelli/JJ noodles/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN (/VBD $/$ 3-4/CD )/CD ./.
I/PRP was/VBD hoping/VBG the/DT salad/NN would/MD be/VB a/DT bit/NN more/RBR 'shredded/JJ '/NN rather/RB than/IN diced/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
The/DT flavors/NNS are/VBP somewhat/JJ bland/NN --/: they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB use/VB too/RB many/JJ spices/NNS ,/, herbs/NNS ,/, (/RB NO/NNP MSG/NNP )/NNP etc/NN but/CC I/PRP was/VBD really/RB needing/VBG a/DT good/JJ ,/, clean/JJ ,/, light/JJ taste/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD their/PRP$ thai/NN iced/VBD tea/NN (/NNS made/VBD with/IN coconut/NN milk/NN )/VBD -/JJ $/$ 4/CD ./.
Their/NNP thai/NNP iced/VBD teas/NNS are/VBP PHENOMENAL/NNP ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP pricey/JJ comparatively/RB (/JJ which/WDT is/VBZ FINE/NNP BY/NNP ME/NNP !/.
as/RB long/RB as/IN I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ vegan/JJ and/CC not/RB made/VBD with/IN crappy/NN condensed/VBD milk/NN )/NNS ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT -/JJ the/DT food/NN is/VBZ healthy/JJ and/CC light/JJ -/NN but/CC do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB robust/rich/salty/greasy/oily/RB tastes/VBZ as/IN you/PRP would/MD expect/VB in/IN your/PRP$ local/JJ Chinese/Asian/NNP veggie/NN stir/NN fry/NN ./.
(/IN Hey/NNP guys/NNS ,/, that/IN means/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ better/JJR for/IN you/PRP )/VBP ./.
Their/NNP noodle/stir/NN fry/NN may/MD be/VB different/JJ altogether/RB ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT vibe/NN I/PRP got/VBD ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT bit/NN pricier/JJR than/IN the/DT average/JJ lunch/NN if/IN you/PRP order/VBP off/RP the/DT regular/JJ menu/NN --/: otherwise/NN they/PRP have/VBP $/VBN 8/CD lunch/NN specials/NNS (/VBP but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ vegan/JJ and/CC healthy/JJ --/: to/TO me/PRP that/IN 's/POS worth/JJ it/PRP )/-NONE- ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP like/IN to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC try/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT lunch/NN specials/NNS or/CC entrees/NNS ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD it/PRP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB LOVE/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'd/MD come/VB back/RB ./.
Psst/RB ,/, they/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ menu/NN !/.
YAY/NNP ./.
Cons/NNS :/: I/PRP wish/VBP they/PRP 'd/VBP stop/VBN using/VBG styrofoam/NN containers/NNS and/CC plastic/JJ bags/NNS ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN I/PRP ordered/VBD the/DT tomato/NN stuffed/VBD with/IN tofu/NN ,/, veggies/NNS and/CC herbs/NNS ./.
The/DT meal/NN was/VBD mostly/RB delicious/JJ but/CC I/PRP am/VBP dinging/VBG a/DT star/NN because/IN I/PRP asked/VBD him/PRP (/IN the/DT owner/NN was/VBD our/VBN server/NN )/NNS if/IN they/PRP could/MD possibly/VB not/RB put/VBN sauce/NN on/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC he/PRP insisted/VBD that/IN the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD integrated/VBN into/IN the/DT meal/NN and/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB impossible/JJ NOT/NNP to/TO sauce/VB it/PRP ./.
Then/RB the/DT meal/NN arrived/VBD and/CC the/DT sauce/NN had/VBD been/VBN poured/VBN on/IN top/NNS in/IN copious/JJ amounts/NNS .../: .but/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB integrated/VBN into/IN the/DT meal/NN at/IN all/DT so/RB there/EX was/VBD no/DT reason/NN for/IN him/PRP to/TO have/VB denied/VBN my/PRP$ request/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN was/VBD sweet/JJ ,/, and/CC gross/VBZ (/RB I/PRP hate/VB sweet/JJ sauces/NNS !/VBP )/.
and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP irked/VBN that/IN he/PRP ruined/VBD an/DT otherwise/NN excellent/JJ vegan/JJ meal/NN ./.
But/CC he/PRP was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC nice/RB and/CC he/PRP tried/VBD to/TO help/VB us/PRP select/VB our/PRP$ meals/NNS (/IN it/PRP was/VBD our/VBN first/JJ time/NN there/EX )/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB return/VB and/CC try/VB some/DT less/JJR saucy/NN things/NNS ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD in/IN Phoenix/NNP for/IN a/DT conference/NN and/CC asked/VBD Yelp/NNP for/IN help/NN on/IN a/DT good/JJ vegetarian/JJ restaurant/NN ./.

We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT spring/NN rolls/VBZ (/IN I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD the/DT Afghan/JJ rolls/NNS .../: ca/MD n't/RB quite/VB remember/NN )/NNS and/CC they/PRP were/VBD better/JJR than/IN average/JJ ./.
We/PRP shared/VBD two/CD entrees/NNS ./.
Pho/NNP and/CC the/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP Chicken/NNP ./.
The/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP Chicken/NNP was/VBD astonishing/VBG good/JJ and/CC just/RB this/DT dish/JJ will/MD give/VB this/DT restaurant/NN a/DT 5-star/JJ rating/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN ./.
It/PRP may/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT top/JJ 5/NN dishes/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD at/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD high/JJ hopes/NNS for/IN the/DT Yellow/NNP Curry/NNP and/CC the/DT Lemongrass/NNP soup/NN ./.
Sadly/RB ,/, both/DT were/VBD tasteless/NN ./.
The/DT soup/NN tasted/VBD like/IN water/NN ./.
Really/RB no/DT sense/NN of/IN lemongrass/NN in/IN the/DT spoonful/JJ of/IN soup/NN ./.
The/DT curry/JJ smelled/JJ abd/NN looked/VBN beautiful/JJ ./.
Again/NN ,/, not/RB any/DT flavor/NN detected/VBD ./.
My/NNP daughter/NN had/VBD a/DT noodle/NN in/IN her/PRP$ lemonade/NN ans/NNS I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN a/DT new/JJ spoon/NN twice/NN ./.
Very/NNP dirty/NN utensils/NNS and/CC dishes/NNS

I/PRP sat/VBP next/JJ to/TO the/DT kitchen/NN and/CC saw/VBD beautiful/JJ plate/NN after/IN plate/NN being/VBG made/NN ./.

I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB like/VB vegan/JJ places/NNS that/WDT try/NN to/TO make/VB vegetable/JJ look/NNS like/IN real/JJ meat/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO admit/VB ,/, Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP does/VBZ the/DT best/JJS job/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT places/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP visited/VBN ./.

I/PRP 'll/VBP admit/JJ .../: the/DT thought/NN of/IN going/VBG to/TO a/DT vegan/JJ restaurant/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ scary/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.

One/CD funny/JJ thing/NN that/IN happened/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT nightly/RB thing/JJ or/CC not/RB .../: but/CC they/PRP gave/VBD us/PRP a/DT stuffed/JJ animal/NN when/WRB we/PRP paid/VBP (/VBN weird/JJ lookin/NN '/'' thing/NN )/NNS ./.
The/DT guy/NN that/IN gave/JJ it/PRP to/TO us/PRP actually/RB said/VBD 'Guys/NNS get/VB the/DT check/NN ,/, girls/VBZ get/VB a/DT doll/NN '/POS ./.
Odd/NNP ./.
Pretty/NNP solid/JJ place/NN ,/, although/IN for/IN the/DT setting/decor/NN it/PRP does/VBZ seem/VB a/DT tad/NN pricier/JJR than/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.
Give/NNP this/DT place/NN a/DT shot/NN !/.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT BEST/NNP vegetarian/JJ food/NN in/IN town/NN ,/, bar/NN none/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB miss/VBZ it/PRP ./.
The/DT good/NN :/: the/DT food/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
We/PRP will/MD return/VB but/CC not/RB during/IN the/DT day/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT heat/NN ./.
The/DT bad/NN :/: the/DT temperature/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD over/IN 80/CD degrees/NNS ./.
The/DT two/CD owners/NNS were/VBD sitting/VBG down/IN having/NN lunch/NN so/IN we/PRP seated/VBD ourself/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD awhile/NN for/IN the/DT owner/NN to/TO deliver/VB menus/NNS in/IN an/DT unfriendly/JJ manner/NN ./.
Obviously/RB ,/, we/PRP interrupted/VBD his/PRP$ lunch/NN ./.
We/PRP felt/VBD as/IN though/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB welcome/JJ ./.
Lunch/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ though/IN a/DT bit/NN expensive/NN ./.
He/PRP finally/RB warned/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT smile/NN after/IN delivering/VBG the/DT check/NN ./.
We/PRP would/MD try/VB it/PRP again/RB but/CC we/PRP would/MD not/RB go/VB out/IN of/IN our/PRP$ way/NN ./.
My/NNP mom/NN and/CC I/PRP drove/VBP up/RP from/IN Chandler/NNP to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT try/NN ./.
When/WRB ever/RB she/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN town/NN we/PRP try/VBP a/DT veggie/NN restaurant/NN we/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN to/TO before/IN ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP was/VBD well/RB worth/IN the/DT drive/JJ !/NN
We/PRP arrived/VBD around/IN 2:30/CD pm/NN and/CC were/VBD greeted/VBN immediately/RB by/IN the/DT owner/NN ./.
He/PRP told/VBD us/PRP to/TO take/VB a/DT seat/NN where/WRB ever/RB we/PRP wanted/RB and/CC he/PRP 'd/VBD bring/NNP menus/NN and/CC silverware/NN ./.
We/PRP sat/VBP outside/RB ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT spring/NN rolls/VBZ to/TO start/NNS and/CC my/PRP$ mom/NN got/VBD the/DT Pho/NNP ./.
The/DT spring/NN rolls/VBZ came/VBD out/RP quickly/RB and/CC were/VBD oh/JJ so/RB good/JJ !/.
My/NNP moms/NNS soup/RB came/VBD out/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS later/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ large/JJ for/IN the/DT small/JJ ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RP sharing/VBG it/PRP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD also/RB really/RB good/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT pepper/NN steak/NN and/CC the/DT hot/NN pot/NN .../: both/DT to/TO share/NN ./.
The/DT pepper/NN steak/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
The/DT veggies/NNS were/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/NN and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD pure/JJ yumminess/NN ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN some/DT roasted/VBN potatoes/NNS that/WDT were/VBD crispy/NN on/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC buttery/NN soft/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD never/RB had/VBD a/DT hot/NN pot/NN before/IN ./.
I/PRP really/RB did/VBD n't/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO expect/NNS ./.
At/IN first/JJ I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT pepper/NN steak/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/VBZ because/IN it/PRP was/VBD in/IN fact/NN ,/, extremely/RB hot/NN (/NNS temperature/VBP hot/NN )/NNS and/CC that/IN took/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT flavor/NN ./.
As/IN it/PRP cooled/VBD down/IN though/NN ,/, the/DT flavors/NNS came/VBD through/IN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD every/VBN bit/NN as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT pepper/NN steak/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ other/JJ dishes/NNS I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO try/NNS ./.
Great/NNP service/NN ,/, great/JJ food/NN ./.
Looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO going/VB back/RB ./.
for/IN a/DT vegan/JJ place/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ decent/JJ ./.
their/PRP$ menu/NN is/VBZ a/DT combination/NN of/IN thai/NN and/CC vietnanese/NN inspired/VBD cuisine/NN ./.
my/PRP$ only/JJ complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN their/PRP$ portions/NNS relatively/RB small/JJ and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ pricier/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ legendary/JJ !/.
Back-story/NN :/: So/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN desperately/RB needed/VBD a/DT break/NN from/IN taking/VBG care/NNS of/IN my/JJ father/NN who/WP just/RB had/VBD a/DT total/JJ knee/NN replacement/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO take/VB her/PRP out/IN to/TO lunch/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, my/PRP$ mom/NN is/VBZ a/DT picky/JJ eater/NN and/CC generally/RB only/RB goes/VBZ to/TO the/DT same/JJ three/CD restaurants/NNS for/IN lunch/NN and/CC dinner/NN ,/, so/IN when/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD her/PRP where/WRB she/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO go/NNS and/CC she/PRP deferred/VBD the/DT question/NN back/RB to/TO me/PRP ,/, I/PRP responded/VBD in/IN a/DT sarcastic/JJ tone/NN ``/`` Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP ,/, its/PRP$ a/DT vegan/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT is/VBZ pretty/RB amazing/VBG ,/, ''/'' thinking/NNP she/PRP would/MD ignore/VB the/DT suggestion/NN and/CC say/VB ``/`` let/NNP 's/POS go/NN to/TO Chili/NNP 's/POS ''/'' ./.
Well/NNP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB know/NNS if/IN she/PRP was/VBD high/JJ on/IN my/NNP Dad/NNP 's/POS Vicodin/NNP or/CC the/DT world/NN is/VBZ indeed/VBN ending/VBG in/IN December/NNP of/IN 2012/CD ,/, but/CC she/PRP actually/RB agreed/VBD and/CC off/IN we/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT strip/NN mall/NN on/IN Thunderbird/NNP and/CC Scottsdale/NNP ./.
Restaurant-story/JJ :/: The/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, but/CC because/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT walls/NNS are/VBP glass/VBG windows/VBZ it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB give/VB you/PRP a/DT claustrophobic/JJ feel/NN and/CC somehow/VB the/DT neon/NN green/NN and/CC bright/NN purple/NN walls/NNS (/IN which/WDT had/VBD a/DT giant/JJ metal/NN mint/NN leaf/NN on/IN it/PRP )/VBD help/VB out/RP as/RB well/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP three/CD booths/NNS ,/, which/WDT could/MD sit/VB four/CD (/NNS skinny/JJ people/NNS )/VBP comfortably/RB ,/, four/CD four-top/JJ tables/NNS ,/, and/CC four/CD two-top/JJ tables/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT few/JJ tables/NNS outside/IN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN immediately/RB by/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT co-owners/NNS (/VBP the/DT husband/NN )/NN who/WP let/-NONE- us/VBP choose/NN where/WRB we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO sit/VB (/JJ there/NN was/VBD only/RB one/CD table/JJ occupied/JJ )/NN and/CC handed/VBD us/PRP our/PRP$ menus/NN ./.
My/NNP mother/NN ordered/VBD a/DT plain/NN iced/VBN tea/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO mix/VB it/PRP up/IN and/CC go/VB with/IN their/PRP$ Thai/NNP iced/VBD tea/NN ./.
This/DT deliciousness/NN consists/NNS of/IN Thai/NNP tea/NN ,/, a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN sugar/NN ,/, and/CC coconut/NN milk/NN ./.
I/PRP found/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB super/NN sweet/NN and/CC rich/NN that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB considered/VBN a/DT dessert/NN as/IN opposed/NN to/TO a/DT routine/NN drink/NN with/IN meals/NNS ./.
The/DT portions/NNS here/RB are/VBP a/DT decent/JJ size/NN and/CC the/DT lunch/NN time/NN prices/NNS are/VBP perfect/RB ./.
We/PRP split/VBD the/DT Fresh/NNP Autumn/NNP Rolls/NNP (/VBD $/$ 6/CD )/CD ,/, Fresh/NNP Island/NNP Green/NNP Salad/NNP (/VBD $/$ 9/CD )/CD ,/, and/CC the/DT Steamed/NNP Veggies/NNPS served/VBN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN peanut/NN sauce/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD so/RB fresh/JJ tasting/NN and/CC even/RB my/VB mother/NN enjoyed/VBD everything/NN !/.
She/PRP actually/RB said/VBD she/PRP would/MD come/VB back/RB to/TO this/DT place/NN for/IN lunch/NN anytime/NN ,/, leaving/NNP Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP legendary/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN !/.
This/DT time/NN I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT sweet/NN and/CC sour/JJ soup/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
I/PRP still/RB had/VBD to/TO wait/VB 30/CD min/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD worth/IN it/PRP this/DT time/NN ./.
Amazing/VBG flavors/NNS and/CC spices/NNS !/.
I/PRP also/RB tried/VBD the/DT soy/JJ beef/NN (/NNS do/VBP n't/RB know/VB exact/JJ name/NN )/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD actually/RB great/JJ but/CC wish/JJ there/NN was/VBD more/RBR meat/JJ to/TO veggie/NN to/TO rice/NN ratio/NN ./.
Will/NNP be/VBD back/RB !/.
Having/VBG lived/VBD in/IN San/NNP Francisco/NNP ,/, where/WRB I/PRP used/VBP to/TO go/VB to/TO vegetarian/Asian/JJ restaurants/NNS I/PRP expected/VBN something/NN with/IN a/DT more/JJR flavor/NN ./.
Ordered/NNP Golden/NNP Curry/NNP for/IN lunch/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB bland/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT slight/NN rancid/NN oil/NN taste/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
No/DT coconut/NN milk/NN or/CC curry/JJ flavor/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
There/NNS were/VBD only/RB two/CD small/JJ cubes/NNS of/IN tofu/NN in/IN this/DT serving/NN ./.
The/DT brown/NN rice/NN was/VBD OK/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT salad/JJ average/NN ./.
The/DT wait/NN for/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD long/RB ,/, and/CC also/RB to/TO get/VB the/DT check/NN ./.
It/PRP would/MD help/VB to/TO have/VB some/DT ready/NN made/VBD food/NN for/IN the/DT lunch/NN hour/NN ,/, but/CC according/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ website/JJ they/PRP prepare/VBP everything/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT order/NN ./.
This/DT might/MD be/VB good/JJ for/IN many/JJ other/JJ dishes/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT curry/JJ gets/NNS better/RBR when/WRB prepared/JJ beforehand/NN ,/, and/CC sits/VBZ a/DT little/JJ bit/NN to/TO deliver/VB more/JJR flavor/NN .../: .../:
The/DT autumn/NN rolls/NNS and/CC pho/NN were/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
The/DT time/NN before/IN we/PRP tried/VBP the/DT summer/NN rolls/NNS which/WDT were/VBD okay/NN ,/, but/CC needed/VBD something/NN more/RBR like/IN fresh/JJ pineapple/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD just/RB cabbage/NN in/IN a/DT rice/NN paper/NN roll/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ healthy/JJ ,/, tasty/JJ options/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP must/MD say/VB the/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ really/RB lacking/VBG and/CC reminded/VBD me/NN of/IN a/DT kid/NN 's/POS playroom/NN with/IN the/DT fluorescent/JJ green/JJ walls/NNS and/CC the/DT giant/JJ purple/NN mint/NN leave/NN on/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.
Despite/IN this/DT with/IN limited/NN vegan/NN and/CC vegetarian/JJ options/NNS in/IN Scottsdale/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB !/.
I/PRP am/VBP breaking/VBG a/DT personal/JJ rule/NN and/CC reviewing/VBG this/DT after/IN the/DT first/JJ visit/NN !/.
My/NNP housemates/NNS and/CC I/PRP went/VBD and/CC we/PRP ate/VBP half/DT of/IN the/DT items/NNS listed/VBP on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD like/IN visiting/VBG several/JJ times/NNS ./.
We/PRP had/VBD imperial/JJ rolls/NNS for/IN starters/NNS ./.
Lemongrass/NNP soy/NNP beef/NN noodles/NNS ,/, papaya/NN salad/NN ,/, hotpot/NN ,/, stuffed/VBD tomatoes/NNS ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP special/NNP lemonades/VBZ for/IN our/PRP$ drink/NN ./.
Then/RB we/PRP finished/VBP with/IN mango/NN tapioca/NN and/CC banana/NN fritters/NNS ./.
After/IN a/DT debauched/VBN weekend/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD this/DT might/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO get/VB back/RB on/IN track/NN and/CC eat/VB a/DT healthy/JJ ,/, nice/JJ vegetarian/JJ meal/NN ./.
As/IN you/PRP can/MD tell/VB from/IN what/WP we/PRP ordered/VBP ,/, the/DT debauchery/NN continued/VBD !/.
The/DT imperial/JJ rolls/NNS were/VBD amazing/VBG for/IN not/RB having/VBG any/DT meat/NN in/IN it/PRP !/.
No/DT loss/NN of/IN flavor/NN whatsoever/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD notice/VB a/DT difference/NN in/IN texture/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB bothersome/JJ ./.
The/DT papaya/NN salad/RB had/VBD to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS dishes/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
It/PRP had/VBD the/DT right/JJ amount/NN of/IN crunch/NN on/IN the/DT fruit/NN ./.
The/DT dressing/NN was/VBD also/RB well/RB balanced/VBN and/CC was/VBD not/RB too/RB spicy/JJ with/IN chili/NN ,/, or/CC salty/NN with/IN fish/JJ sauce/NN or/CC sour/JJ with/IN lemon/NN ,/, and/CC just/RB the/DT hint/NN of/IN sweetness/NN ./.
The/DT addition/NN of/IN Thai/NNP basil/NN gave/VBD it/PRP a/DT refreshing/NN finish/JJ ./.
Just/NNP wondering/VBG though/IN ,/, if/IN they/PRP used/VBP fish/JJ sauce/NN at/IN all/DT .../: being/VBG vegetarian/JJ .../: hmmm/NN ./.
My/NNP next/NNP favorite/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT hotpot/NN ./.
A/DT super/NN hot/NN ceramic/JJ bowl/NN filled/VBD with/IN sizzling/VBG brown/VBN rice/NN and/CC vegetables/NNS with/IN a/DT sauce/NN that/WDT just/RB imparts/VBZ flavor/NN without/IN being/VBG obnoxiously/RB present/JJ ./.
The/DT vegetables/NNS were/VBD not/RB overcooked/VBN ,/, the/DT rice/NN was/VBD starting/VBG to/TO crust/NN at/IN the/DT bottom/NN and/CC the/DT sauce/JJ brought/NN it/PRP all/DT together/NN ./.
You/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB and/CC taste/VB for/IN yourself/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ./.
At/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN ,/, Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP was/VBD staffed/VBN by/IN a/DT father-daughter/JJ team/NN ,/, with/IN daughter/NN at/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT house/NN ./.

My/NNP rec/NN is/VBZ to/TO go/VB with/IN friends/NNS who/WP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB sharing/NN ,/, and/CC order/NN tons/NNS of/IN food/NN ./.
Everything/IN we/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN has/VBZ been/VBN delicious/JJ ,/, reasonably/RB priced/RB ,/, and/CC beautifully/RB presented/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ favorite/JJ spot/NN for/IN us/PRP and/CC worth/VB the/DT drive/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP vegan/VBN pho/NN !/.

This/DT place/NN was/VBD solidly/RB good/JJ ./.
My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP ate/VBP here/RB when/WRB passing/NN through/IN Scottsdale/NNP ./.
We/PRP actually/RB saw/VBD the/DT sign/NN and/CC pulled/VBD over/RP because/IN we/PRP realized/VBD how/WRB hungry/JJ we/NNS were/VBD ./.
We/PRP shared/VBD autumn/RB rolls/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD cut/VBN up/RP like/IN sushi/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD quite/JJ fresh/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
We/PRP each/VBP had/VBD an/DT item/NN from/IN the/DT lunch/NN express/NN menu/NN ./.

The/DT eggplant/NN was/VBD wonderfully/RB tender/JJ and/CC the/DT dressing/NN on/IN the/DT salad/NN was/VBD tasty/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ downsides/NNS were/VBD that/IN service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ slow/NN (/NN though/IN quite/JJ friendly/JJ )/NN and/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN thought/VBD the/DT water/NN had/VBD a/DT bad/JJ smell/taste/NN and/CC he/PRP could/MD n't/RB drink/VB it/PRP ./.

I/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB surprised/VBN at/IN the/DT wonderful/JJ reviews/NNS on/IN yelp/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP guess/VBZ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP vegan/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO find/VB anywhere/RB to/TO eat/NN ./.
So/IN myself/NN being/VBG a/DT meateater/NN ,/, I/PRP give/VBP it/PRP only/RB 3/RB stars/NNS ./.

But/CC if/IN you/PRP love/VBP vegan/JJ food/NN like/IN I/PRP do/VBP ,/, try/VB green/JJ or/CC loving/VBG hut/NN !/.

They/PRP are/VBP friendly/RB ,/, chatty/NN and/CC genuinely/RB warm/NN and/CC welcoming/VBG ./.
Nothing/NN is/VBZ ever/RB a/DT problem/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ wonderful/JJ and/CC they/PRP do/VBP very/RB creative/JJ things/NNS with/IN meat/NN substitutes/NNS ./.

A/DT tip/NN 'o/IN the/DT hat/NN for/IN that/DT .../:
Upon/NNP entering/VBG the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, it/PRP just/RB had/VBD a/DT weird/JJ energy/NN ./.
It/PRP sort/NN of/IN felt/NNS like/IN things/NNS were/VBD just/RB thrown/VBN together/RB ./.
Anybody/NNP else/RB notice/VBD the/DT bad/JJ chi/NN ?/.
I/PRP still/RB decided/VBD to/TO order/NN food/NN ,/, but/CC takeout/JJ instead/NN of/IN dining/NN in/IN because/IN of/IN the/DT vibe/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT kung/NN pao/NN chicken/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD absolutely/RB imagine/VB some/DT vegans/vegetarians/NNS not/RB being/VBG able/JJ to/TO stomach/VB the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT faux/NN meat/NN here/RB ./.
I/PRP can/MD only/RB imagine/VB all/DT of/IN the/DT processing/NN they/PRP do/VBP to/TO turn/VB the/DT soy/NN into/IN what/WP they/PRP serve/VBP ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP kind/NN of/IN pact/NN they/PRP made/VBD with/IN the/DT meat/NN gods/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP have/VBP the/DT texture/NN and/CC look/NN down/IN to/TO a/DT science/NN ./.
Literally/RB ./.
It/PRP made/VBD me/PRP wonder/JJR what/WP kind/NN of/IN graduated/VBN cylinders/NNS ,/, Bunsen/NNP burners/NNS and/CC potions/NNS they/PRP have/VBP in/IN the/DT back/NN ,/, with/IN some/DT evil/JJ scientist/NN ,/, er/NN ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP chef/NN at/IN the/DT helm/NN ./.
The/DT array/NN of/IN vegetables/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ entree/NN looked/VBD and/CC tasted/VBN fresh/NN and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC added/VBD with/IN a/DT light/JJ hand/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP appreciate/VBP ./.
The/DT portions/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC NOT/NNP for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
My/NNP meal/NN was/VBD $/$ 13/CD !/.
No/DT drink/NN ,/, no/DT salad/NN ,/, no/DT dessert/NN ./.
Er/NNP .../: Do/NNP you/PRP know/VB how/WRB many/JJ burrito/NN bowls/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ ?/VBG !/.
Just/NNP saying/VBD .../: All/NN in/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD steer/VB away/RB from/IN the/DT faux/NN meat/NN and/CC focus/NN on/IN the/DT salads/NNS (/VBP and/CC the/DT prices/NNS !/.
)/NN ./.
Thank/NNP you/PRP ,/, Yelpers/NNS ,/, for/IN steering/JJ me/NN to/TO yet/VB another/DT great/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT valley/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD worried/VBN about/IN taking/CD my/NNS parents/JJ here/RB -/JJ especially/RB my/VBN father/NN as/IN he/PRP has/VBZ a/DT limited/VBN palate/NN and/CC prefers/NNS standard/VBP meat/NN &/CC potato/NN dishes/NNS ,/, but/CC flavor/NN and/CC presentation/NN of/IN everything/NN quickly/RB quelled/VBD those/DT fears/NNS ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN appetizers/NNS -/JJ summer/NN rolls/NNS with/IN peanut/NN sauce/NN (/VBD quite/RB tasty/JJ )/NN ,/, vegetable/JJ soup/NN with/IN mint/JJ (/NNS I/PRP did/VBD not/RB try/VB this/DT but/CC my/PRP$ father/NN said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ )/NN and/CC BBQ/NNP peanut/NN veggie/NN shiskebabs/NNS ./.

Oh/NNP so/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT golden/NN curry/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN a/DT small/JJ handful/NN of/IN gluten-free/JJ dishes/NNS here/RB ./.
(/IN The/DT lemongrass/NN curry/NN is/VBZ also/RB GF/NNP ;/: will/MD be/VB trying/VBG that/IN next/JJ time/NN )/NN ./.
Abundant/JJ with/IN flavor/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD way/RB different/JJ than/IN the/DT usual/JJ Vietnamese/NNP yellow/NN curry/NN dishes/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.
This/DT was/VBD sweeter/JJ and/CC there/EX was/VBD a/DT particular/JJ spice/NN used/VBD that/IN tasted/VBN almost/RB Indian/JJ ./.
Cardamom/NNP ,/, perhaps/RB ?/.
My/NNP father/NN ordered/VBD the/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP soy/JJ chicken/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/RB much/RB heat/VB for/IN him/PRP ,/, but/CC he/PRP ate/VB it/PRP anyway/RB because/IN it/PRP was/VBD so/RB tasty/JJ ./.
He/PRP kept/VBD remarking/VBG throughout/IN the/DT meal/NN how/WRB colorful/JJ the/DT food/NN was/VBD ./.

Obviously/RB ,/, vegetables/NNS are/VBP not/RB part/NN of/IN my/NNP father/NN 's/POS standard/JJ fare/NN ./.
My/NNP mom/NN had/VBD a/DT basic/JJ stir-fry/JJ (/NN Rainbow/NNP something/NN ?/. )/.
which/WDT she/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ impressed/VBN by/IN ./.
Portions/NNS were/VBD ample/JJ as/IN other/JJ reviewers/NNS have/VBP stated/VBN ,/, with/IN the/DT owner/NN telling/VBG us/PRP he/PRP did/VBD not/RB want/VB people/NNS to/TO leave/VB hungry/NN ./.
For/IN a/DT table/JJ of/IN 4/CD ,/, with/IN appetizers/NNS ,/, entrees/NNS and/CC a/DT pot/NN of/IN tea/NN ,/, our/PRP$ bill/NN came/VBD to/TO $/$ 76/CD ./.
This/DT was/VBD the/DT other/JJ standout/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.
As/IN my/PRP$ father/NN was/VBD getting/VBG out/IN his/PRP$ wallet/NN ,/, he/PRP was/VBD told/VBG not/RB to/TO bother/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT pad/JJ Thai/NNP and/CC would/MD definitely/RB get/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
I/PRP loved/VBD that/IN everything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN was/VBD vegan/JJ besides/NNS two/CD items/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD no/DT idea/NN what/WP I/PRP was/VBD getting/VBG myself/NN into/IN when/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD into/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB wanted/VBD to/TO test/NN out/IN what/WP the/DT vegan/NN and/CC vegetarian/JJ scene/NN was/VBD like/IN in/IN Arizona/NNP while/IN vacationing/NN ./.
Initially/RB when/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN ,/, no/DT one/CD greeted/JJ me/NN and/CC I/PRP walked/VBD to/TO the/DT counter/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD directed/VBN to/TO a/DT table/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT same/JJ guy/NN who/WP directed/VBN me/PRP there/RB came/VBD back/RB to/TO take/VB my/NN order/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN started/VBD off/RP a/DT bit/NN shaky/NN ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD him/PRP what/WP exactly/RB was/VBD the/DT soy/JJ fish/JJ made/VBD out/IN of/IN ./.
His/PRP$ response/NN ,/, ``/`` A/DT soy/JJ product/NN ./. ''/''
I/PRP was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO get/VB specifics/NNS :/: tempeh/JJ ?/.

TVP/NNP ?/.
For/IN all/DT I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP could/MD 've/VB been/VBN made/VBN of/IN seitan/JJ ./.
I/PRP ignored/VBD the/DT vague/JJ response/NN and/CC ordered/VBD the/DT meal/NN ./.
The/DT moment/NN I/PRP tasted/VBD the/DT first/JJ bite/NN ,/, I/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP ./.

That/DT Soy/NNP Fish/NNP in/IN a/DT Clay/NNP Pot/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ downside/NN was/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB a/DT good/JJ dessert/NN option/NN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP vegan/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ real/JJ dairy/NN cake/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN tapioca/NN pudding/VBG ,/, especially/RB with/IN mandarin/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP gave/VBP it/PRP a/DT shot/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ okay/NN ./.

It/PRP looks/VBZ like/IN snot/NN to/TO me/PRP ,/, but/CC it/PRP tastes/VBZ all/DT right/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD a/DT Vietnamese/NNP Pho/NNP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD made/VBN with/IN veggie/NN broth/NN which/WDT made/VBN me/PRP nervous/JJ because/IN does/VBZ veggie/VB broth/JJ really/RB taste/VBP good/JJ ?/.
Surprisingly/RB it/PRP did/VBD and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT take/JJ out/NN and/CC the/DT packaging/NN was/VBD nicely/RB presented/JJ ,/, with/IN the/DT noodles/NNS and/CC veggies/NNS and/CC side/NN sauces/NNS in/IN one/CD container/NN ,/, in/IN different/JJ compartments/NNS and/CC the/DT soup/NN in/IN a/DT separate/JJ container/NN ,/, thus/RB preventing/VBG the/DT noodles/NNS from/IN overcooking/NN and/CC getting/VBG too/RB mushy/JJ ./.

What/WP a/DT disappointment/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD extremely/RB bland/JJ and/CC lacking/JJ in/IN distinctive/JJ flavor/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD four/CD dishes/NNS :/: (/JJ 1/CD )/CD kung/NN pao/NN ``/`` chicken/NN ./. ''/''
The/DT fake/NN chicken/NN was/VBD very/RB chewy/JJ and/CC did/VBD n't/RB have/VB any/DT chicken/VBN flavor/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD no/DT heat/NN (/IN spice/NN )/NNS whatsoever/NN in/IN the/DT dish/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN vegetarian/JJ chicken/VBN kung/NN pao/NN elsewhere/RB that/IN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
This/DT was/VBD not/RB ./.
(/RB 2/CD )/NNS Eggplant/JJ with/IN basil/NN and/CC tofu/NN ./.
Small/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN tofu/NN that/IN looked/JJ like/IN crinkle/NN cut/NN fries/NNS ./.
Minimal/NNP basil/NN flavor/NN ./.
Minimal/NNP spice/NN ./.
(/IN 3/CD )/NNS Mushroom/RB wonder/JJR ./.
This/DT dish/NN was/VBD a/DT tad/JJ better/NN ./.
Meaty/NNP mushrooms/NNS and/CC sauteed/VBD onions/NNS along/IN with/IN the/DT vegetables/NNS ./.
The/DT ``/`` special/JJ ''/'' sauce/NN was/VBD somewhat/JJ sweet/NN and/CC not/RB at/IN all/DT special/NNS ./.
(/IN 4/CD )/CD Vegetable/JJ chow/NN mein/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN opted/VBD for/IN the/DT soft/NN noodles/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD essentially/RB soup/RB ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB understand/VB how/WRB chow/JJ mein/NN can/MD come/VB out/RP in/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN broth/NN ./.
She/PRP did/VBD seem/VB to/TO like/IN it/PRP ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD pronounced/VBN it/PRP bland/NN ./.
Also/RB the/DT food/NN did/VBD not/RB come/VB out/RP particularly/RB hot/NN and/CC got/VBD cold/NN very/RB quickly/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT coconut/NN tapioca/NN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN it/PRP before/IN so/RB ca/MD n't/RB compare/VB it/PRP to/TO other/JJ versions/NNS but/CC it/PRP was/VBD ok/JJ ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, the/DT food/NN is/VBZ expensive/JJ for/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP but/CC I/PRP would/MD gladly/RB pay/VB it/PRP if/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
This/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB worth/JJ your/JJ time/NN or/CC money/NN unless/IN you/PRP will/MD only/RB eat/VB at/IN a/DT vegan/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC insist/NN on/IN going/VBG out/NNS ./.
Decent/NNP Vegan/NNP food/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD give/VB points/NNS for/IN consistency/NN ,/, quality/NN ,/, and/CC variety/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP that/IN I/PRP can/MD get/VB good/JJ healthy/JJ food/NN here/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB not/RB my/VB first/JJ choice/NN for/IN vegan/JJ food/NN ./.
Few/NNP ingredients/NNS such/JJ as/IN their/PRP$ soy/JJ based/NN meat/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, they/PRP can/MD really/RB work/VB on/IN improving/VBG overall/JJ taste/NN of/IN their/PRP$ entrées/NNS ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT entrées/NNS I/PRP tried/MD have/VB pretty/RB much/JJ same/JJ type/NN of/IN base/NN sauce/NN ,/, and/CC same/JJ type/NN of/IN vegetables/NNS ./.
some/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP loaded/VBN with/IN raw/JJ boiled/JJ vegetables/NNS (/VBP broccoli/NN ,/, zucchini/NNP is/VBZ standard/JJ in/IN all/DT )/NNS ,/, which/WDT kind/NN of/IN offsets/NNS the/DT taste/NN ./.
A/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN seasoning/NN or/CC sautéed/JJ vegetables/NNS may/MD work/VB better/RBR ./.
their/PRP$ spring/NN rolls/NNS are/VBP amazing/VBG ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ tapioca/NN pudding/VBG dessert/NN is/VBZ great/JJ too/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD really/RB excited/VBN to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN but/CC I/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
First/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT bathroom/NN had/VBD no/DT soap/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO wash/VB my/PRP$ hands/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN seemed/VBD really/RB frazzled/VBN that/IN he/PRP had/VBD just/RB stocked/VBN the/DT soap/NN in/IN there/NNP and/CC maybe/JJ someone/NN stole/NN it/PRP ./.
He/PRP was/VBD helpful/JJ in/IN getting/NNP some/DT but/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB annoying/VBG ./.
Then/RB the/DT dish/JJ I/PRP ordered/VBP was/VBD not/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT .../NNS ./.
Hot/NNP Pot/NNP ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ it/PRP was/VBD an/DT issue/NN of/IN personal/JJ tastes/NNS vs./NN quality/NN but/CC the/DT whole/JJ vegetarian/JJ fake/NN fish/JJ grossed/VBN me/PRP out/RP ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP a/DT bit/JJ high/JJ and/CC I/PRP just/RB wo/MD n't/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, I/PRP also/RB tried/VBD the/DT lemonade/NN (/NN expensive/NN and/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB see/VB or/CC taste/VB any/DT mint/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. )/''
Although/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ on/IN Scottsdale/NNP Rd/NNP I/PRP must/MD admit/VB it/PRP 'd/MD be/VB easily/RB overlooked/VBN given/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ located/VBN in/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN a/DT strip/NN mall/NN ./.
The/DT dining/JJ area/NN is/VBZ small/JJ but/CC bright/JJ ./.
Upon/NN entering/VBG at/IN lunchtime/JJ I/PRP found/VBD a/DT full/JJ house/NN but/CC was/VBD welcomed/VBN with/IN a/DT smile/NN ./.
Thankfully/RB there/EX was/VBD a/DT small/JJ table/JJ in/IN the/DT rear/NN that/IN was/VBD perfect/JJ for/IN me/PRP since/IN I/PRP was/VBD dining/VBG alone/RB ./.
Per/NNP their/NNP website/JJ ,/, Fresh/JJ Mint/NNP puts/VBZ a/DT Vietnamese/NNP twist/NN on/IN regular/JJ vegetarian/JJ dishes/NNS ./.
All/DT of/IN their/PRP$ dishes/NNS are/VBP 100/CD %/NN vegetarian/NN and/CC made/VBD only/RB when/WRB ordered/JJ to/TO guarantee/NN freshness/NN ./.
Although/IN I/PRP could/MD order/VB off/RP of/IN the/DT regular/JJ menu/NN I/PRP was/VBD grateful/JJ for/IN the/DT lunch/NN menu/NN that/WDT offered/JJ several/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ main/JJ dishes/NNS for/IN a/DT lunch/JJ time/NN price/NN ,/, which/WDT also/RB helped/VBD me/PRP narrow/VB down/RP my/PRP$ entree/NN of/IN choice/NN ./.
One/CD drawback/JJ I/PRP found/VBD is/VBZ that/IN the/DT regular/JJ dinner/NN prices/NNS of/IN entrees/NNS cost/VBG up/IN to/TO $/$ 14/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ more/RBR expensive/JJ than/IN I/PRP 'd/MD like/VB to/TO pay/NN for/IN the/DT location/NN and/CC ambiance/NN of/IN Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP ./.
This/DT is/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB something/NN that/IN would/MD keep/VB me/PRP from/IN eating/VBG here/RB but/CC I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB keep/VB in/IN mind/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP I/PRP 'll/MD just/RB stick/VB to/TO lunch/NN ./.
Ultimately/RB I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP Soy/NNP Chicken/NNP that/IN contains/VBZ spicy/NN classic/JJ Kung/NNP Pao/NNP sauce/NN with/IN garlic/JJ ,/, white/JJ and/CC green/JJ onions/NNS ,/, soy/JJ chicken/NN ,/, zucchini/NNP ,/, bell/NN pepper/NN ,/, carrots/NNS and/CC peanuts/NNS I/PRP patiently/RB waited/VBD for/IN my/NN food/NN while/IN I/PRP enjoyed/VBD watching/VBG the/DT hustle/NN and/CC bustle/NN of/IN the/DT lunchtime/NN crowd/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, my/PRP$ seat/NN was/VBD located/VBN right/NN next/IN to/TO the/DT bar/NN where/WRB the/DT rolls/NNS and/CC salads/NNS were/VBD being/VBG prepared/VBN ./.
Soon/NNP my/VBD lunch/NN arrived/VBD ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN that/IN I/PRP prefer/VBP my/JJ tofu/NN pretty/RB well/RB done/VBN and/CC not/RB squishy/JJ inside/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP always/RB hesitant/JJ to/TO try/VB new/JJ dishes/NNS .../: but/CC my/PRP$ tofu/NN was/VBD done/VBN perfectly/RB !/.
With/IN that/DT being/NNP said/VBD ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB surprised/VBN that/IN I/PRP ate/VBP every/DT morsel/NN of/IN food/NN on/IN my/PRP$ plate/NN ./.
Good/NNP food/NN excellent/JJ selection/NN service/NN was/VBD great/JJ no/DT complaints/NNS will/MD definitely/RB go/VB back/RB
Fresh/NNP ,/, good/JJ quality/NN food/NN ./.
Abundance/NN of/IN vegetarian/JJ and/CC vegan/JJ options/NNS ./.
If/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO describe/VB this/DT place/NN in/IN one/CD word/NN ,/, that/WDT word/NN would/MD be/VB ``/`` AWESOME/NNP ./. ''/''
Really/RB stretching/VBG my/PRP$ vocab/NN there/RB ,/, huh/NN ?/.
My/NNP inability/NN to/TO muster/VB clever/NN language/NN at/IN 6/CD am/NN aside/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN really/RB is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP always/RB on/IN the/DT lookout/NN for/IN good/JJ vegetarian/JJ places/NNS and/CC this/DT one/NN was/VBD no/DT disappointment/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD in/IN Scottsdale/NNP ,/, AZ/NNP for/IN the/DT weekend/NN visiting/VBG some/DT relatives/NNS and/CC my/PRP$ mom/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN for/IN lunch/NN (/NN after/IN I/PRP had/VBD found/VBN it/PRP using/VBZ the/DT ``/`` nearby/JJ ''/'' search/NN function/NN of/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
And/CC guess/JJ what/NN ?/.
There/EX was/VBD another/DT group/NN dining/NN while/IN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB and/CC we/PRP overheard/VBP them/PRP say/VBP they/PRP also/RB found/VBD the/DT place/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP needs/NNP one/CD of/IN those/DT stickers/NNS on/IN the/DT front/NN door/NN that/WDT says/VBZ ``/`` People/NNP Love/NNP Us/NNPS On/NNP Yelp/NNP ./. ''/''
Like/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, this/DT place/NN is/VBZ vegetarian/JJ and/CC probably/RB 90/CD %/NN vegan/NN ./.
So/IN vegans/NNS ,/, be/VB not/RB afraid/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Mushroom/NNP Wonder/NNP and/CC a/DT bowl/NN of/IN the/DT Vietnamese/NNP Hot/NNP and/CC Sour/NNP Soup/NNP ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ mom/NN ordered/VBD the/DT Rainbow/NNP Wonder/NNP with/IN Vegetable/JJ soup/NN in/IN a/DT garlicy/NN broth/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD delish/JJ ./.
And/CC from/IN looking/NN over/IN the/DT menu/NN I/PRP surmised/VBD there/RB probably/RB was/VBD n't/RB a/DT dish/JJ that/NN was/VBD n't/RB tasty/JJ ./.
Everything/NN looked/VBD so/RB good/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ mid-priced/JJ ./.
Not/RB cheap/NN as/IN dirt/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD worth/JJ every/DT penny/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD super/NN friendly/RB and/CC the/DT atmosphere/NN was/VBD clean/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC inviting/VBG ./.
My/NNP ONLY/NNP knock/NN on/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC maybe/VB the/DT reason/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT 5th/NN star/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ ./.
Quite/JJ slow/NNS ./.
They/PRP could/MD probably/RB use/VB another/DT staff/NN member/NN or/CC two/CD during/IN peak/NN hours/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB the/DT husband/NN and/CC wife/NN owners/NNS and/CC one/CD other/JJ employee/NN for/IN Saturday/NNP lunchtime/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP on/IN the/DT go/NN and/CC really/RB need/VBP something/NN quick/JJ -/JJ you/PRP 're/VBP probably/RB better/RBR off/JJ hitting/VBG up/RP the/DT Subway/NNP next/JJ door/NN ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP have/VBP some/DT time/NN to/TO sit/VB down/RP and/CC enjoy/JJ and/CC great/JJ lunch/NN or/CC dinner/NN ,/, Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP is/VBZ THE/NNP place/NN !/.

As/RB much/RB as/IN I/PRP 'd/VBP love/JJ to/TO become/VB a/DT vegetarian/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB sounded/JJ like/IN way/NN too/RB much/JJ work/NN ,/, mostly/RB because/IN of/IN all/PDT the/DT washing/NN and/CC chopping/NN of/IN vegetables/NNS ./.
If/IN I/PRP could/MD just/RB get/VB all/DT my/NN meals/NNS from/IN Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD be/VB good/JJ to/TO go/NN ./.
The/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP with/IN tofu/NN and/CC vegetables/NNS is/VBZ delicious/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN fake/NN meat/NN options/NNS but/CC I/PRP prefer/VBP to/TO just/RB go/VB with/IN tofu/NN or/CC just/RB vegetables/NNS ./.
Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP really/RB shows/VBZ how/WRB varied/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ vegetarian/JJ food/NN can/MD be/VB ./.

I/PRP love/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT full/JJ menu/NN of/IN vegetarian/JJ cuisine/NN ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN there/EX is/VBZ enough/JJ demand/NN ,/, so/RB what/WP gives/NNP ?/.
Chakra/NNP is/VBZ still/RB my/VBG favorite/JJ but/CC they/PRP have/VBP such/JJ limited/VBN hours/NNS that/IN I/PRP never/RB get/VBP the/DT chance/NN to/TO eat/VB there/RB ./.
Fresh/NNP mint/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG and/CC their/PRP$ hours/NNS are/VBP much/JJ better/NN but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ still/RB very/RB far/RB from/IN where/WRB I/PRP live/VBP ,/, but/CC luckily/RB close/JJ to/TO where/WRB I/PRP live/VBP ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT consensus/NN that/IN their/PRP$ Kung/NNP Pao/NNP Soy/NNP Chicken/NNP is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ./.
In/IN the/DT future/JJ I/PRP 'd/MD really/RB like/IN to/TO branch/VB out/RP and/CC try/VBD some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ soups/NNS but/CC I/PRP tend/VBP to/TO stick/VB with/IN what/WP works/NNS ./.
The/DT owner/NN is/VBZ usually/RB there/RB and/CC helping/VB the/DT staff/NN and/CC he/PRP is/VBZ really/RB friendly/RB and/CC affable/JJ ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, fresh/JJ mint/NN has/VBZ an/DT extensive/JJ menu/NN ,/, pretty/RB reasonable/JJ prices/NNS and/CC a/DT nice/JJ interior/NN ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP they/PRP open/VBP more/JJR in/IN the/DT Central/NNP Phoenix/NNP area/NN in/IN the/DT future/JJ !/NN

We/PRP were/VBD 7/JJ people/NNS including/VBG 2/CD small/JJ children/NNS ./.
I/PRP made/VBD a/DT reservation/NN for/IN 730/CD ./.

The/DT owner/NN was/VBD just/RB weird/JJ ,/, unprofessional/JJ ,/, and/CC inappropriate/JJ ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB matter/VB if/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB even/RB able/JJ to/TO get/VB to/TO that/DT point/NN ./.
It/PRP all/VBD turned/VBD out/RP great/JJ though/NN ,/, because/IN we/PRP ended/VBD up/RP going/VBG to/TO Green/NNP (/NNP see/NNP my/NNP review/NN )/NN that/WDT was/VBD close/JJ by/IN ,/, and/CC it/PRP ended/VBD up/RP being/VBG even/RB better/JJR ./.

No/DT menu/NN items/NNS with/IN a/DT drink/NN were/VBD under/IN $/$ 14/CD ./.
I/PRP think/VBP this/DT place/NN would/MD be/VB fine/NN for/IN dinner/NN ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ not/RB for/IN lunch/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/RB ones/JJ there/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD quiet/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT was/VBD at/IN noon/NN ./.

I/PRP truly/VBP wish/JJ I/PRP could/MD give/VB this/DT place/NN 3.5/CD stars/NNS ./.

I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT cucumber/NN rolls/VBZ (/JJ appetizer/NN )/NN and/CC my/PRP$ bf/NN ordered/VBD the/DT pho/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD an/DT exceptionally/JJ long/JJ time/NN to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ food/NN after/IN lunch/NN rush/JJ hour/NN ./.
While/IN I/PRP appreciate/VBP that/IN everything/NN is/VBZ made/VBN when/WRB you/PRP order/VBP it/PRP .../: An/DT hour/NN seems/VBZ like/IN an/DT aweful/JJ long/JJ time/NN to/TO wait/VB for/IN julienned/VBN veggies/NNS wrapped/VBD in/IN raw/NN cucumber/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN peanut/NN sauce/NN ./.

I/PRP liked/VBD it/PRP but/CC my/PRP$ compadres/NNS felt/IN it/PRP was/VBD less/JJR than/IN authentic/JJ ./.
Bottom/NNP line/VBD .../: Go/NNP here/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN healthy/JJ fair/NN that/WDT 's/POS vegan/JJ friendly/NN and/CC you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB in/IN a/DT rush/JJ !/NN
I/PRP can/MD mow/VB through/IN a/DT cow/NN so/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN no/DT way/NN a/DT vegan/NN but/CC I/PRP met/VBP a/DT friend/NN here/RB for/IN lunch/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD sincerely/RB impressed/VBN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP and/CC it/PRP comes/VBZ mildly/RB spicy/JJ but/CC I/PRP had/VBD them/PRP kick/VB it/PRP up/IN to/TO medium/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD fantastic/JJ and/CC the/DT salad/NN that/IN came/NN before/IN the/DT meal/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD in/IN and/CC out/IN of/IN the/DT door/NN in/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS ,/, too/RB !/.
We/PRP got/VBD there/RB at/IN 11:30/CD and/CC after/IN 11:45/CD it/PRP filled/VBD up/RP pretty/RB quickly/RB so/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN a/DT hurry/NN ,/, go/NNP early/RB ./.
Meat/NNP lover/NN converted/VBD !/NNP !/.
I/PRP agreed/VBD to/TO go/VB to/TO Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP only/RB to/TO satisfy/VB the/DT vegetarian/JJ love/NN of/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ./.
As/IN I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ most/RBS carnivores/NNS would/MD expect/VB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD prepared/VBN to/TO eat/VB unfamiliar/JJ veggies/NNS and/CC soy/JJ products/NNS drowned/VBD in/IN disguising/NN sauces/NNS ./.
But/CC to/TO my/PRP$ surprise/NN ,/, IT/NNP WAS/NNP THE/NNP BEST/NNP MEAL/NNP I/PRP HAD/NNP EATEN/NNP IN/NNP MONTHS/NNP !/NNP !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB kidding/VBG meat/NN lovers/NNS ,/, if/IN all/DT vegetarian/JJ dishes/NNS tasted/VBN as/RB good/JJ as/IN this/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD convert/VB immediately/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Soy/NNP Ginger/NNP Chicken/NNP ,/, Black/NNP Pepper/NNP Beef/NNP and/CC the/DT 5/NN spice/NN soup/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN more/RBR beautiful/JJ than/IN the/DT dishes/NNS that/IN arrived/JJ ,/, was/VBD the/DT woman/NN I/PRP was/VBD dining/VBG with/IN ./.
Perfect/NNP presentation/NN ,/, great/JJ texture/NN ,/, flavorful/JJ and/CC yes/NNS ,/, fulfilling/VBG !/.
I/PRP will/MD DEFINITELY/VB continue/JJ to/TO eat/NN there/RB ,/, especially/RB when/WRB I/PRP 'm/VBP looking/VBG for/IN healthy/JJ food/NN choices/NNS ./.
Tried/NNP this/DT place/NN out/IN on/IN a/DT whim/JJ just/RB the/DT other/JJ day/NN and/CC ,/, not/RB being/VBG a/DT vegan/NN or/CC a/DT vegetarian/JJ ,/, but/CC liking/VBG Asian/JJ style/JJ food/NN in/IN general/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB sure/JJ what/WP to/TO expect/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD far/RB from/IN disappointed/VBN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN !/.
Arriving/VBG early/RB for/IN the/DT lunch/NN hour/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD n't/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT crowd/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT place/NN did/VBD fill/JJ up/IN in/IN short/JJ order/NN ./.
From/NNP what/WP I/PRP could/MD overhear/VB from/IN the/DT interaction/NN with/IN the/DT owner/NN ,/, it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN many/JJ of/IN them/PRP were/VBD regulars/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD reassuring/VBG ./.
After/IN all/DT ,/, if/IN those/DT people/NNS keep/VBP coming/VBG back/RB ,/, they/PRP must/MD be/VB doing/VBG something/NN right/NN !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD pleasant/JJ and/CC not/RB overly/RB pretentious/JJ ,/, just/RB a/DT tad/NN slow/NN at/IN times/NNS ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, there/EX could/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR smiles/NNS or/CC slightly/RB faster/JJR service/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT one/CD person/NN operation/NN for/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP was/VBD there/RB (/JJ it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN other/JJ servers/NNS showed/VBD up/RP later/JJ ?/. )/.
so/IN I/PRP can/MD sympathize/VB to/TO a/DT degree/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS ./.
As/IN to/TO the/DT food/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ surprised/VBN ./.

I/PRP could/MD have/VB eaten/VBN more/JJR ,/, it/PRP was/VBD that/IN good/JJ !/NN
For/IN the/DT lunch/NN itself/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD with/IN one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ specials/NNS ,/, the/DT soy/JJ mongolian/JJ beef/NN dish/VB ./.

Despite/IN reading/NN many/JJ negative/JJ reviews/NNS about/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, I/PRP indeed/VBD experienced/VBN a/DT waiting/JJ time/NN for/IN food/NN that/IN was/VBD inexcusable/JJ ./.

The/DT food/NN itsself/NN was/VBD about/IN what/WP you/PRP 'd/VBP expect/RB for/IN asian/JJ vegetarian/JJ ,/, but/CC if/IN I/PRP ever/VBP came/JJ back/RB I/PRP would/MD order/VB takeout/NN ./.

Even/RB slower/JJR if/IN there/EX are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS dining/VBG during/IN a/DT peak/JJ time/NN ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP calling/VBG for/IN takeout/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP on/IN a/DT tight/JJ schedule/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP have/VBP plenty/NN of/IN time/NN and/CC do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB waiting/VBG a/DT little/JJ while/NN ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ worth/IN it/PRP ./.

One/CD thing/NN I/PRP found/VBD a/DT little/JJ weird/NN ,/, though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB necessarily/RB a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN ,/, was/VBD that/IN they/PRP only/RB give/VBP forks/NNS to/TO eat/VB with/IN ./.

Maybe/NNP a/DT little/JJ pricey/NN for/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, but/CC the/DT service/NN from/IN the/DT staff/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ cozy/NN comfortable/JJ setup/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB frequent/VB vegetarian/JJ restaurants/NNS often/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT veggie/NN fried/VBD rice/NN with/IN tofu/NN was/VBD pretty/RB tasty/JJ and/CC the/DT portion/NN was/VBD quite/JJ hearty/NN ./.
Even/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT carnivore/NN like/IN me/PRP its/PRP$ worth/NN a/DT try/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB has/VBZ the/DT fried/VBN rice/NN which/WDT was/VBD hearty/JJ and/CC tasty/NN ,/, a/DT meal/NN in/IN its/PRP$ self/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD give/VB it/PRP 5/-NONE- stars/NNS if/IN they/PRP had/VBD wine/VBN and/CC a/DT better/JJR environment/NN ,/, but/CC come/VBP for/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB disappointed/VBN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO go/VB here/RB twice/JJ recently/RB and/CC loved/VBD it/PRP both/DT times/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ and/CC healthy/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ slow/NN but/CC that/DT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO everything/NN being/VBG cooked/VBN fresh/JJ upon/IN order/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ defiantly/RB worth/IN the/DT wait/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP ./.
Disappointing/VBG after/IN high/JJ reviews/NNS ./.
The/DT pad/NN thai/NN was/VBD not/RB what/WP is/VBZ usually/RB is/VBZ ./.
The/DT veggies/NNS included/VBD squash/JJ and/CC was/VBD not/RB diced/VBN and/CC incorporated/VBN into/IN the/DT noodles/NNS ./.
Meanwhile/RB there/EX was/VBD almost/RB no/DT peanut/NN sauce/NN ./.
The/DT green/JJ papaya/NN salad/NN was/VBD healthy/JJ tasting/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB on/IN the/DT cheap/NN ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN epitomizes/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP feel/VBP sorry/JJ for/IN vegetarians/NNS ./.
I/PRP am/VBP an/DT omnivore/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP neither/DT afraid/JJ nor/NN put-off/NN by/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN an/DT all/NN veggie/NN meal/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ very/RB clean/JJ and/CC the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB but/CC the/DT food/NN tends/NNS to/TO be/VB either/VBN bland/NN or/CC odd/JJ tasting/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ painfully/RB slow/JJ even/RB when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB busy/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ redeeming/VBG quality/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP cater/VBP to/TO vegans/NNS (/NN who/WP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB any/DT better/JJR than/IN to/TO rate/NN this/DT 5/NN stars/NNS )/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ working/VBG for/IN them/PRP though/IN ./.
Let/NNP me/VBD start/VBN out/RP by/IN simply/RB stating/NN :/: the/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ incredible/JJ ./.

They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP things/NNS you/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN of/IN before/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN (/NN Kung/NNP Pao/NNP SOY/NNP chicken/NN and/CC Golden/NNP Curry/NNP Vegetables/NNP )/NNP but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT regular/JJ here/NN and/CC have/VBP tried/VBN many/JJ dishes/NNS and/CC I/PRP can/MD safely/RB say/VB it/PRP is/VBZ done/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN done/VBN before/IN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT far/RB jump/VBN from/IN fast/JJ food/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN typical/JJ ,/, greasy/JJ ,/, mediocre/JJ Chinese/JJ food/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB find/VB it/PRP here/RB ;/: nor/NNP will/MD you/VB find/VB a/DT run-of-the-mill/NN salad/JJ bar/NN ./.
As/IN corny/NN as/IN it/PRP sounds/VBZ .../: Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP lives/VBD up/RP to/TO its/PRP$ name/NN :/: everything/NN tastes/NNS fresh/JJ !/.
The/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP extremely/RB flavorful/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT work/NN of/IN art/NN ./.

You/PRP can/MD tell/VB the/DT owners/NNS and/CC employees/NNS put/VBP care/NN into/IN their/PRP$ food/NN display/NN --/: this/DT is/VBZ a/DT family/NN owned/NN restaurant/VBD so/RB from/IN what/WP I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN ,/, they/PRP certainly/RB put/VBP pride/NN into/IN their/PRP$ work/NN ./.
Your/PRP$ experience/NN is/VBZ not/RB over/IN once/RB you/PRP leave/VBP ./.

Before/NNP I/PRP even/RB took/VBD my/NN seat/NN outside/IN I/PRP was/VBD greeted/VBN with/IN a/DT menu/NN and/CC silverware/NN ./.
And/CC before/IN i/NN even/RB opened/VBD the/DT menu/NN i/NN got/VBD ice/JJ water/NN and/CC so/RB did/VBD my/PRP$ dog/NN !/.
Who/NNP joined/VBD me/PRP for/IN lunch/NN on/IN the/DT patio/NN ./.
The/DT interior/NN was/VBD very/RB inviting/JJ with/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ shades/NNS of/IN green/JJ ,/, and/CC A/C/NNP ./.
But/CC I/PRP choose/VBP outside/VBN on/IN green/JJ furniture/NN ./.
Not/RB just/RB patio/VB furniture/NN but/CC wooden/JJ chairs/NNS and/CC good/JJ tables/NNS ./.
But/CC if/IN my/PRP$ shirt/NN was/VBD any/DT thinner/NN I/PRP would/MD have/VB splinters/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ back/NN ./.
The/DT wooden/NN chairs/NNS are/VBP worn/JJ from/IN the/DT weather/JJ outside/NN ./.
I/PRP placed/VBP my/JJ order/NN for/IN the/DT golden/VBN soy/NN chicken/NN delight/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
Chicken/NNP was/VBD crisp/NN on/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC moist/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN a/DT perfect/NN portion/NN or/CC excellently/RB cooked/JJ veggies/NNS ./.
Broccoli/NNP ,/, squash/JJ ,/, peppers/NNS ,/, and/CC cauliflower/JJR ./.
And/CC my/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN jasmine/NN or/CC brown/NN rice/NN chose/NN jasmine/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Dessert/NNP and/CC mint/JJ flavored/VBN drinks/NNS were/VBD tempting/VBG but/CC I/PRP just/RB had/VBD my/VBN meal/NN and/CC water/NN and/CC walked/VBD out/RP for/IN under/IN twelve/JJ bucks/NNS ./.
The/DT reason/NN I/PRP am/VBP giving/VBG it/PRP a/DT 4/JJ instead/NN of/IN five/CD was/VBD the/DT splintery/NN chairs/NNS and/CC patio/NN floor/NN needs/NNS to/TO be/VB pressure/VBN washed/JJ ./.
So/IN I/PRP gave/VBD Fresh/JJ Mint/NNP another/DT try/NN Friday/NNP night/NN ./.

Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ and/CC friendly/RB as/IN usual/JJ ./.
Another/DT bonus/NN is/VBZ that/IN brown/JJ rice/NN is/VBZ not/RB more/RBR !/.

Both/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ,/, the/DT portions/NNS turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB perfect/NN ./.
Everything/NNP had/VBD good/JJ flavor/NN ,/, the/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP was/VBD weak/JJ heat/NN wise/NN for/IN me/PRP but/CC will/MD be/VB perfect/JJ for/IN most/JJS ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN this/DT does/VBZ not/RB get/VB 5/JJ stars/NNS on/IN my/PRP$ update/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT Vegan/NNP Thai/Vietnamese/Whatever/NNP place/NN on/IN the/DT Phoenix/Scottsdale/NNP line/NN with/IN high/JJ end/NN LA/NNP Vegan/NNP place/NN prices/NNS ./.
My/NNP Kung/NNP Pao/NNP was/VBD $/$ 14/CD dollars/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT more/RBR expensive/JJ things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN but/CC I/PRP had/VBD gotten/VBN other/JJ things/NNS and/CC they/PRP had/VBD just/RB been/VBN ok/NN ./.
If/IN prices/NNS were/VBD a/DT tad/JJ more/RBR reasonable/JJ then/RB this/DT place/NN would/MD be/VB 5/VBN stars/NNS for/IN sure/JJ ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP people/NNS need/VBP to/TO make/VB a/DT living/NN and/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB go/VB into/IN business/NN to/TO not/RB make/VB a/DT profit/NN but/CC think/NN of/IN other/JJ Vegan/NNP places/NNS in/IN the/DT valley/NN and/CC their/PRP$ prices/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ always/RB great/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP love/VB their/PRP$ lemonade/NN ./.

If/IN there/EX 's/VBZ only/RB two/CD of/IN us/PRP ,/, or/CC God/NNP forbid/JJ it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB me/JJ ,/, I/PRP often/RB feel/VBP like/IN the/DT owner/NN finds/VBZ it/PRP a/DT burden/NN to/TO seat/NN me/NNS ./.
Not/RB a/DT good/JJ impression/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN variety/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT mushroom/NN wonder/NN and/CC the/DT vegetarian/JJ citrus/NN spare/JJ ribs/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP always/RB get/VBP the/DT Thai/NNP iced/VBD tea/NN to/TO go/VB with/IN ./.

The/DT owners/NNS are/VBP so/RB sweet/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
I/PRP truly/VBP enjoyed/VBN eating/VBG there/RB ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC one/CD more/RBR thing/JJ -/JJ the/DT BEST/NNP Arnold/NNP Palmer/NNP I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD !/.
Fresh/NNP lemonade/NN and/CC fresh/JJ iced/VBN tea/NN -/NN deeelicious/JJ !/.
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, let/NNP 's/POS give/NN some/DT praise/NN to/TO the/DT concept/NN :/: A/DT vegan/NN ,/, vietnamese-style/NN ,/, Kosher/NNP restaurant/NN ?/.
That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT coolest/NN thing/NN I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN since/IN someone/NN explained/VBD nonstick/JJ frying/VBG pans/NNS to/TO me/PRP ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT service/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT bit/NN slow/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT bit/NN weird/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN to/TO give/VB them/PRP some/DT credit/NN for/IN opening/VBG a/DT place/NN like/IN this/DT ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP composed/VBN of/IN rice/noodles/NNS ,/, steamed/VBD veggies/NNS ,/, and/CC one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ vegan/JJ meats/NNS like/IN chicken/NN ,/, beef/NN ,/, ribs/NNS ,/, fish/JJ ,/, etc./NN ,/, doused/VBD in/IN sauce/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ awesome/JJ sauce/NN (/NN saucesome/JJ ?/. )/.
but/CC it/PRP pretty/RB much/RB negates/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT healthier/NN aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT dish/JJ ./.
Why/WRB not/RB wait/VB to/TO add/VB those/DT extra/JJ calories/NNS with/IN some/DT vegan/JJ carrot/NN or/CC chocolate/NN cake/NN instead/RB ?/.
As/IN far/RB as/IN recommendations/NNS ,/, the/DT lemongrass/NN tofu/NN rolls/NNS and/CC green/JJ papaya/NN salad/NN are/VBP both/DT light/NNS ,/, filling/NN and/CC fresh/JJ tasting/VBG dishes/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT sauce-o-holic/JJ ,/, opt/NN for/IN the/DT tasty/NN BBQ/NNP citrus/VBZ spare/JJ ribs/NNS or/CC soy/JJ fish/NN in/IN a/DT clay/NN pot/NN ./.
.../: .For/NNP those/DT of/IN you/PRP who/WP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO read/VB any/DT of/IN that/DT ,/, refer/NN to/TO the/DT short/NNP &/CC sweet/JJ version/NN below/IN :/: Concept/NNP :/: hell/JJ yeah/NN ./.
Service/NN :/: weird/NN ./.
Selection/NN of/IN ``/`` meat/NN ''/'' :/: awesome/NN ./.
Vegan/NNP desserts/NNS :/: much/JJ appreciated/VBN ./.

I/PRP 'll/VBP probably/RB go/VBN back/RB at/IN some/DT point/NN ./.
I/PRP pass/VBP this/DT shopping/NN center/NN every/DT day/NN on/IN my/PRP$ way/NN to/TO work/NN and/CC read/VB some/DT great/JJ things/NNS on/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
One/CD of/IN my/PRP$ best/JJS friends/NNS is/VBZ vegetarian/JJ so/IN I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB nice/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO try/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD there/RB around/IN 12:15/CD yesterday/NN and/CC grabbed/VBD the/DT last/JJ remaining/NN table/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN promptly/RB and/CC had/VBD our/VBN order/NN taken/NN within/IN about/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS after/IN being/VBG seated/VBN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT fried/JJ spring/NN veggie/NN rolls/VBZ (/RB $/$ 6/CD )/NN that/IN were/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP kept/VBD snacking/VBG off/RP the/DT fried/VBN crispy/NN pieces/NNS of/IN the/DT sides/NNS ./.
For/IN lunch/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN the/DT curry/JJ tofu/NN and/CC potatoes/NNS (/VBD $/$ 8/CD )/CD ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN carrots/NNS mixed/VBN in/IN the/DT curry/JJ sauce/NN with/IN rice/NN and/CC salad/NN ./.
I/PRP equally/RB enjoyed/VBD the/DT salad/JJ and/CC curry/JJ sauce/NN over/IN the/DT rice/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB care/VB for/IN the/DT spongy/NN tofu/NN and/CC would/MD have/VB liked/VBN more/JJR vegetables/NNS in/IN the/DT curry/JJ rather/NN than/IN just/RB potatoes/NNS and/CC carrots/NNS ./.
This/DT lunch/NN was/VBD just/RB okay/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD horrible/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB my/PRP$ lunch/NN until/IN 12:50/CD p.m/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD aware/JJ of/IN it/PRP and/CC apologized/VBD but/CC apologies/NNS do/VBP n't/RB prevent/VB me/PRP from/IN getting/VBG back/NNS to/TO work/VB on/IN time/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP were/VBD ready/NN to/TO pay/VB ,/, it/PRP took/VBD forever/NN for/IN him/PRP to/TO pick/VB up/RP the/DT check/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN had/VBD to/TO flag/NN him/PRP down/VBD to/TO get/VB his/PRP$ attention/NN ./.

Timely/RB service/NN in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.
I/PRP would/MD have/VB average/JJ food/NN and/CC phenomenal/NN service/NN ,/, as/IN opposed/JJ to/TO ,/, phenomal/JJ food/NN and/CC terrible/JJ service/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD decent/mediocre/JJ at/IN times/NNS with/IN terrible/JJ service/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ doubtful/JJ I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD really/RB ,/, really/RB fresh/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ made/VBN to/TO order/NN so/RB do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB to/TO being/VBG in/IN and/CC out/IN in/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN how/WRB tasty/JJ their/PRP$ veg/NN pho/NN was/VBD ./.
Everyone/NNP eating/VBG around/IN me/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB it/PRP as/IN well/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB impressed/VBN with/IN Fresh/JJ Mint/NNP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT best/JJS Veggie/NNP food/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN and/CC the/DT service/NN left/VBD a/DT little/JJ to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ,/, but/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD my/PRP$ meal/NN and/CC the/DT decor/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP having/VBG the/DT carmelized/JJ fish/JJ and/CC my/JJ boyfriend/NN had/VBD the/DT kung/NN pow/NN chicken/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD flavorful/JJ and/CC cooked/JJ perfectly/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD jamsmine/JJ iced/VBN tea/NN and/CC was/VBD never/RB offered/VBD a/DT refill/NN ,/, which/WDT sucked/JJ ,/, because/IN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, yeah/JJ ,/, we/PRP started/VBD off/RP with/IN the/DT Pho/NNP which/WDT was/VBD really/RB really/RB good/JJ ./.
It/PRP had/VBD fake/VBN beef/NN in/IN it/PRP and/CC was/VBD sweeter/JJ then/RB normal/JJ Pho/NNP but/CC was/VBD really/RB really/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT soup/NN ./.
The/DT bathrooms/NNS were/VBD really/RB nice/JJ ./.
That/DT normally/RB doesnt/JJ matter/NN to/TO people/NNS but/CC i/JJ really/RB liked/VBD them/PRP so/IN I/PRP figured/VBD I/PRP would/MD point/VB it/PRP out/IN Overall/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ experience/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
There/EX were/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN different/JJ dishes/NNS I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO try/NNP ,/, especially/RB after/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT comments/NNS about/IN the/DT chicken/NN being/VBG so/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT pad/NN thai/NN ./.
it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB tasty/JJ ./.
Seems/NNS to/TO be/VB a/DT family/NN run/NN restaurant/NN ./.
Very/NNP nice/NNP staff/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP all/VBP looked/VBN overly/RB stressed/VBN and/CC hectic/JJ which/WDT I/PRP understand/VBP running/VBG a/DT small/JJ business/NN ./.
If/IN i/NNP 'm/NNP ever/RB in/IN the/DT area/NN i/NN 'll/RB check/JJ them/PRP out/RP again/RB but/CC its/PRP$ just/RB too/RB far/RB of/IN a/DT drive/JJ for/IN me/PRP to/TO stop/VB by/IN all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.
We/PRP found/VBD Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP while/IN searching/NN for/IN vegetarian/JJ dining/VBG options/NNS in/IN Scottsdale/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT drive/JJ from/IN where/WRB we/PRP were/VBD staying/VBG down/IN on/IN N./NNP McDowell/NNP Road/NNP ,/, but/CC totally/RB worth/IN it/PRP !/.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ a/DT smallish/JJ (/NN but/CC very/RB bright/JJ and/CC cheerful/JJ )/NNS storefront/VBD operation/NN in/IN a/DT large/JJ shopping/NN complex/IN a/DT few/JJ miles/NNS north/NN of/IN downtown/NN Scottsdale/NNP ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN that/WDT hits/VBZ you/PRP ,/, as/IN you/PRP walk/VBP in/IN ,/, is/VBZ ``/`` wow/JJ .../: something/NN smells/VBZ fantastic/JJ !/. ''/''
(/RB always/RB a/DT good/JJ way/NN to/TO start/VB a/DT relationship/NN with/IN a/DT restaurant/JJ !/NN )/NN ./.
Jasmine/NNP rice/NN and/CC ginger/NN .../: one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ combinations/NNS !/.
We/PRP chose/VBP to/TO sit/VB inside/NN (/NN there/EX is/VBZ what/WP appears/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT good-sized/JJ patio/NN seating/VBG area/NN as/IN well/RB )/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB impressed/VBN by/IN the/DT décor/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD very/RB bright/JJ ,/, clean/JJ ,/, and/CC modern/JJ .../: despite/IN the/DT size/NN and/CC the/DT location/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB the/DT look/NN or/CC feel/NN of/IN a/DT fast-food/NN joint/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD prompt/JJ ,/, friendly/RB ,/, and/CC knowledgeable/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB a/DT bit/JJ overwhelming/VBG for/IN us/PRP when/WRB we/PRP can/MD eat/VB anything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN without/IN having/NN to/TO ask/VB ``/`` does/VBZ this/DT have/VB meat/NN in/IN it/PRP ?/. ''/''
or/CC ``/`` is/VBZ this/DT cooked/JJ with/IN fish/JJ sauce/NN ?/. ''/''
so/IN it/PRP took/VBD us/PRP a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS to/TO decide/VB what/WP to/TO have/VB ./.
We/PRP finally/RB settled/VBD on/IN an/DT order/NN of/IN the/DT fried/VBN imperial/JJ rolls/NNS to/TO share/NN ./.
For/IN our/PRP$ entrees/NNS ,/, I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT Golden/NNP Soy/NNP Chicken/NNP Delight/NNP (/VBD the/DT words/NNS ``/`` ginger/JJ sauce/NN ''/'' get/NN me/IN every/DT time/NN !/NN )/.
and/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN chose/VB the/DT Signature/NN Lemongrass/NNP Curry/NNP (/NN with/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ eggplant/NN option/NN rather/RB than/IN tofu/NN )/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD both/DT pleased/VBN that/IN they/PRP offer/VBP brown/VBN rice/NN as/IN an/DT option/NN (/IN we/PRP 'll/VBP eat/JJ white/JJ rice/NN ,/, but/CC prefer/NN brown/NN )/NN ./.
Everything/NN is/VBZ prepared/VBN fresh/JJ to/TO order/NN there/RB ,/, so/RB we/PRP 'd/MD expected/VB service/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT bit/NN slow/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN at/IN how/WRB quickly/RB our/PRP$ appetizer/NN came/VBD out/RP ./.
The/DT imperial/JJ rolls/NNS were/VBD absolutely/RB delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT taro-based/JJ filling/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT slight/NN sweetness/NN was/VBD nicely/RB off-set/JJ by/IN the/DT tasty/NN ,/, vinegary/NN ,/, sauce/NN that/IN was/VBD served/VBN alongside/NN ./.
A/DT single/JJ order/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ for/IN two/CD ./.
Our/NNP entrees/VBZ came/VBD out/RP shortly/RB after/IN we/PRP 'd/VBP finished/VBN the/DT imperial/JJ rolls/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD love/JJ at/IN first/JJ bite/NN !/.
I/PRP had/VBD planned/VBN to/TO ask/VB them/PRP if/IN they/PRP make/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ meat/NN analogs/NNS and/CC forgot/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ too/RB bad/JJ ,/, because/IN the/DT texture/NN was/VBD unique/JJ and/CC very/RB pleasant/JJ (/NN often/RB meat/JJ analogs/NNS can/MD have/VB an/DT unpleasantly/JJ chewy/NN texture/NN ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ ``/`` chicken/NN ''/'' was/VBD nicely/RB tender/JJ )/NN ./.
The/DT sauces/NNS were/VBD wonderful/JJ !/.
Mine/NNP had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ ,/, gingery/JJ edge/NN ,/, and/CC my/NNP husband/NN 's/POS curry/NN was/VBD deliciously/RB complex/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT lovely/RB lemony/JJ taste/NN from/IN the/DT lemongrass/NN ./.
Presentation/NNP was/VBD very/RB attractive/JJ ./.
If/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO nitpick/JJ ,/, the/DT one/CD thing/NN I/PRP would/MD change/VB is/VBZ the/DT ordering/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN ./.
Both/DT our/NN entrees/VBZ had/VBD the/DT rice/NN and/CC the/DT saucy/NN ,/, meaty/NN stuff/NN separated/VBN by/IN a/DT large/JJ ``/`` dam/NN ''/'' of/IN lightly/RB steamed/VBN vegetables/NNS ,/, which/WDT made/-NONE- it/PRP difficult/VBD to/TO combine/VB the/DT entrée/NN with/IN the/DT rice/NN ./.
The/DT veggies/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN and/CC well-prepared/JJ ,/, but/CC there/EX were/VBD too/RB many/JJ of/IN them/PRP and/CC they/PRP were/VBD cut/VBN too/RB large/JJ to/TO make/VB them/PRP easy/JJ to/TO incorporate/NN into/IN the/DT dish/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB cutting/VBG them/PRP more/JJR finely/RB and/CC serving/VBG them/PRP on/IN one/CD side/NN of/IN the/DT plate/NN rather/RB than/IN between/IN the/DT rice/NN and/CC the/DT ``/`` meat/NN ./. ''/''
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT very/RB minor/JJ point/NN ,/, though/IN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN does/VBZ n't/RB serve/VB alcohol/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP both/VBP had/VBN tea/NN with/IN our/PRP$ meals/NNS ./.
Soft/NNP drinks/NNS were/VBD also/RB available/JJ ./.
One/CD interesting/JJ thing/NN ,/, that/IN some/DT diners/NNS may/MD want/VB to/TO know/VB about/IN .../: the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ certified/VBN kosher/NN !/.
I/PRP overheard/VBD the/DT owner/NN speaking/NN with/IN a/DT Jewish/JJ couple/NN at/IN a/DT nearby/JJ table/JJ and/CC evidently/RB when/WRB they/PRP opened/VBD in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, an/DT early/JJ patron/NN strongly/RB advised/VBD them/PRP to/TO get/VB kosher/NN certification/NN ,/, as/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ Jewish/NNP community/NN in/IN that/DT part/NN of/IN Scottsdale/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ to/TO see/VB a/DT restaurant/NN that/WDT is/VBZ truly/RB sensitive/JJ to/TO the/DT needs/NN of/IN the/DT community/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRP finds/VBZ itself/PRP ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT very/RB pleasant/JJ dining/NN experience/NN !/.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB believe/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ taken/VBN me/PRP this/DT long/NN to/TO visit/VB Fresh/NNP Mint/NNP --/: I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN missing/VBG out/IN !/.
Everything/NN from/IN the/DT service/NN to/TO the/DT food/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN by/IN the/DT friendliest/JJS staff/NN ;/: the/DT owner/NN (/IN I/PRP think/VBP )/JJ treated/VBN us/PRP like/IN we/PRP were/VBD guests/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ home/NN ,/, such/JJ a/DT delight/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP lunch/NN special/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.

On/IN my/PRP$ second/NN visit/NN I/PRP had/VBD the/DT curry/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Kung/NNP Pao/NNP Soy/NNP Chicken/NNP lunch/NN special/NN for/IN $/$ 8.00/CD ./.
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB only/RB freshly/RB prepared/VBN and/CC delicious/JJ but/CC had/VBD generous/JJ portions/NNS that/WDT included/JJ salad/NN and/CC brown/NN rice/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Iced/VBN Thai/NNP coffee/NN as/RB well/RB that/IN was/VBD just/RB as/IN tasty/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD friendly/RB ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ even/RB through/IN a/DT busy/NN lunch/NN rush/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD go/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB other/JJ items/NNS ./.

The/DT owner/NN is/VBZ so/RB friendly/RB and/CC accommodating/VBG !/.
He/PRP goes/VBZ out/IN of/IN his/PRP$ way/NN to/TO provide/VB good/JJ service/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ so/RB yummy/JJ too/RB !/.
I/PRP believe/VBP his/PRP$ wife/NN is/VBZ the/DT chef/NN but/CC whoever/JJR it/PRP is/VBZ works/VBG magic/JJ !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT recent/JJ plant/NN food/NN advocate/NN trying/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT better/JJR vegetarian/NN and/CC I/PRP love/VB the/DT selection/NN !/.
It/PRP makes/VBZ me/PRP so/RB happy/JJ to/TO know/VB that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP eating/VBG healthy/JJ and/CC saving/VBG a/DT few/JJ animals/NNS along/IN the/DT way/NN .../: or/CC at/IN least/JJS not/RB munching/VBG on/IN them/PRP (/VBD that/IN 's/POS just/RB me/JJ )/NN ./.
Even/RB if/IN you/PRP like/VBP meat/NN though/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD appreciate/VB the/DT great/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN options/NNS and/CC the/DT faux/NN stuff/NN will/MD satisfy/VB you/PRP -/JJ I/PRP guarantee/VBP it/PRP ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO try/VB something/NN new/JJ next/JJ time/NN I/PRP go/VBP ./.
P.S/NNP ./.
The/DT thai/NN ice/NN tea/NN is/VBZ my/VBN favorite/JJ !/.
Oh/NNP and/CC be/VB sure/JJ to/TO try/VB the/DT fried/VBN imperial/JJ rolls-/NN they/PRP 're/VBP so/RB good/JJ !/.
This/DT food/NN was/VBD so/RB very/RB bland/JJ ./.
Ordered/NNP lemongrass/NN tofu/NN and/CC found/VBD a/DT miniscule/JJ piece/NN of/IN it/PRP in/IN the/DT bland/NN dish/VB ./.
Big/NNP chunks/NNS of/IN tofu/NN and/CC steamed/VBD vegetables/NNS is/VBZ not/RB tasty/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN delightful/JJ vegan/JJ food/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT was/VBD truly/RB boring/JJ and/CC quite/JJ overpriced/VBN ,/, even/RB for/IN its/PRP$ location/NN ./.
I/PRP used/VBD to/TO eat/VB here/RB a/DT couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ago/IN and/CC remember/VB the/DT food/NN having/VBG some/DT flavor/NN and/CC even/RB some/DT interesting/JJ flavored/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB tonight/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ why/NN anyone/NN would/MD call/VB this/DT the/DT best/JJS food/NN they/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP did/VBD enjoy/VB this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD reading/JJ reviews/NNS and/CC noticed/VBD quite/RB a/DT few/JJ people/NNS comment/NN on/IN wait/JJ time/NN and/CC lack/NN of/IN service/NN ./.
Luckily/RB ,/, we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB any/DT such/JJ issues/NNS the/DT night/NN we/PRP dined/VBD in/IN ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD appx/NN 8-10/CD minutes/NNS for/IN our/JJ food/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT yellow/JJ curry/NN and/CC the/DT Imperial/NNP Roll/NNP Noodles/NNP ./.
Yellow/NNP curry/NN was/VBD good/JJ -/JJ but/CC it/PRP lacked/VBD a/DT certain/JJ flavor/NN ./.
Satisfying/NNP in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD filling/VBG ,/, but/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN authenticity/NN ./.
I/PRP definitely/RB can/MD name/VB a/DT few/JJ other/JJ places/NNS I/PRP 'd/MD rather/RB have/VB curry/JJ at/IN ./.
The/DT noodle/JJ bowl/NN was/VBD on/IN point/NN -/NN loved/VBD that/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB skimp/VB on/IN the/DT veggie/NN rolls/NNS ./.
Could/NNP 've/VBD used/VBN a/DT little/JJ more/RBR vinegar/JJ sauce/NN though/IN -/JJ split/NN between/IN the/DT salad/NN and/CC the/DT actual/JJ noodles/NNS -/JJ it/PRP needed/VBD just/RB a/DT bit/JJ more/RBR ./.
I/PRP suppose/VBP I/PRP could/MD 've/VB asked/VBN .../: ha/NN !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD fine/NN ./.
Nothing/NN too/RB special/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB lacking/VBG either/NN ./.
The/DT person/NN whom/VBZ I/PRP assumed/VBD was/VBD the/DT manager/NN served/VBD as/IN the/DT hostess/NN and/CC the/DT person/NN checking/VBG people/NNS out/IN ./.
He/PRP was/VBD mostly/RB attentive/JJ ./.
Honestly/RB ,/, this/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ idea/NN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN tasty/NN sounding/VBG dishes/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC one/NN 's/POS that/IN honestly/RB I/PRP 'd/MD love/VB to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC try/RB ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP n't/RB crazy/NN by/IN any/DT means/NN ,/, but/CC $/$ 15/CD for/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT Chef/NNP 's/POS Specials/NNS -/JJ I/PRP sorta/VBP shrug/JJ my/NN shoulders/NNS at/IN because/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB seem/VB THAT/NNP amazing/VBG ./.
Like/IN c'mon/NN ,/, $/$ 15/CD for/IN veg/NN chow/NN mein/NN ?/. ?/.
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP 'd/MD rather/RB go/VB to/TO an/DT authentic/JJ Chinese/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC get/VB my/PRP$ pan/NN fried/VBD noodles/NNS for/IN $/$ 8/CD ./.
Hot/NNP pot/NN might/MD be/VB worth/VBN it/PRP -/-NONE- but/CC the/DT mock/NN meat/NN dishes-/NN not/RB so/RB much/RB ./.
We/PRP definitely/RB want/VBP to/TO come/VB back/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT list/NN .../:
Very/NNP good/NNP Kosher/NNP ,/, vegan/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT owners/NNS are/VBP Jewish/JJ and/CC Vietnamese/NNP ,/, they/PRP lived/VBD in/IN Hawaii/NNP and/CC therefore/VB their/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ Hawaiian/JJ based/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD 4/RB of/IN us/PRP that/IN ended/VBD up/RP sharing/VBG 4/NN entrees/NNS so/IN we/PRP could/MD try/VB a/DT little/NN of/IN each/DT ./.
We/PRP had/VBD stuffed/VBN tomatoes/NNS ,/, braised/VBD ribs/NNS ,/, ginger/JJR soy/JJ chicken/NN and/CC pad/NN thai/NN ./.
All/DT were/VBD exceptionally/RB delicious/JJ ./.
You/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB tell/VB the/DT meat/NN was/VBD imitation/JJ meat/NN ./.
The/DT flavor/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC everything/NN was/VBD made/VBN to/TO order/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT big/JJ group/NN so/IN he/PRP put/VBD in/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN the/DT orders/NNS at/IN a/DT time/NN since/IN they/PRP were/VBD freshly/RB made/VBN ./.
I/PRP would/MD highly/RB recommend/VB this/DT place/NN and/CC will/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
Tried/IN the/DT kung/NN pao/NN soy/JJ chicken/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
The/DT lunch/NN special/JJ comes/NN with/IN a/DT scoop/NN of/IN rice/NN ,/, and/CC small/JJ portion/NN of/IN salad/JJ ./.
The/DT outstanding/JJ feature/NN is/VBZ the/DT flavorful/JJ sauce/NN which/WDT complements/VBZ the/DT soy/JJ chicken/NN and/CC veggies/NNS very/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT veggies/NNS and/CC chicken/NNS themselves/PRP are/VBP prepared/VBN very/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT veggies/NNS are/VBP not/RB too/RB hard/JJ or/CC soft/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ tender/RB ./.
While/IN the/DT mock/NN chicken/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, I/PRP still/RB could/MD detect/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD faux/VBN chicken/NN in/IN texture/NN and/CC taste/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT gem/NN !/.
I/PRP eat/VBP meat/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB everyday/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ beyond/IN satisfaction/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT place/NN that/WDT one/CD will/MD crave/VB after/IN only/RB one/CD visit/NN !/.
Not/RB only/RB is/VBZ it/PRP super/JJR yummy/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP leave/VBP feeling/VBG good/JJ about/IN your/PRP$ choices/NNS and/CC feeling/VBG good/JJ about/IN spending/CD money/NN at/IN a/DT place/NN ran/NN by/IN its/PRP$ owners/NNS !/.
Wife/NNP ,/, husband/NN and/CC son/NN ./.

This/DT place/NN is/VBZ AWESOME/NNP .../:
I/PRP am/VBP a/DT meat/NN and/CC potatoes/NNS kind/NN of/IN girl/NN .../: a/DT definite/NN carnivore/NN but/CC I/PRP just/RB keep/VBP having/VBG to/TO return/NN time/NN and/CC time/NN again/RB to/TO this/DT place/NN ./.
The/DT Spicy/NNP Ginger/NNP Soy/NNP Beef/NNP and/CC the/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP are/VBP both/DT excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT Mint/NNP Lemonade/NNP is/VBZ refreshing/VBG ./.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB how/WRB good/JJ vegetarian/JJ food/NN can/MD be/VB this/DT is/VBZ THE/NNP place/NN to/TO go/VB .../:
If/IN there/EX were/VBD more/RBR places/NNS like/IN this/DT I/NN could/MD see/VB being/VBG an/DT occasional/JJ vegetarian/JJ (/NN I/PRP could/MD n't/RB give/VB up/RP meat/NN completely/RB )/JJ ./.
Not/RB really/RB sure/JJ what/WP all/PDT the/DT hype/NN is/VBZ about/IN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD pretty/RB bland/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT following/NN :/: Tofu/NNP fresh/JJ spring/NN rolls/NNS -/JJ there/EX was/VBD literally/RB ONE/NNP strip/NN of/IN tofu/NN .../: finger/JJR size/NN circumference/NN inside/NN and/CC filled/VBD to/TO the/DT gills/NNS with/IN veggies/NNS -/JJ veggies/NNS were/VBD fresh/JJ though/IN ./.
Papaya/NNP salad/VBD -/JJ the/DT most/RBS blandest/JJ dish/JJ -/JJ almost/NNS like/IN jicama/NN salad/NN ,/, just/RB a/DT bunch/NN of/IN veggies/NNS with/IN a/DT dash/JJ of/IN lime/NN juice/NN ./.
Lemongrass/NNP tofu/NNP curry/JJ -/NN this/DT was/VBD the/DT better/NN of/IN the/DT three/CD but/CC still/RB mediocre/NN ./.
Would/NNP I/PRP come/VBP back/RB ?/.
Probably/RB not/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB many/JJ times/NNS and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ never/RB disappointed/VBN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN many/JJ of/IN the/DT roles/NNS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP all/DT light/JJ and/CC refreshing/NN ./.
I/PRP typically/RB like/IN to/TO try/VB new/JJ things/NNS when/WRB I/PRP go/VBP to/TO restaurants/NNS but/CC I/PRP love/VBP the/DT lemongrass/NN tofu/NN too/RB much/JJ to/TO stray/NN from/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT owner/NN 's/POS are/VBP super/JJ friendly/RB and/CC lovely/RB people/NNS and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ they/PRP settled/VBD AZ/NNP
