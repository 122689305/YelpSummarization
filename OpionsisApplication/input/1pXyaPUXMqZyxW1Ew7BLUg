Quelle/NNP joie/NNP d'avoir/NNP découvert/NN ce/NN restaurant/NN ./.
Il/NNP est/VBD à/CD une/JJ minute/JJ à/NN pied/VBD du/NN bord/NN de/IN l'eau/NN ,/, assez/NN spacieux/NN et/NN confortable/JJ ce/NN restaurant/VB est/JJS une/JJ merveille/NN ./.
La/NNP carte/NN est/NN très/NNS généreuse/NN ,/, le/NN service/NN fut/NN efficace/NN et/NN ceci/NN n'est/JJS pas/NNS un/JJ détail/NN les/VBZ plats/NNS étaient/JJ excellents/NNS ./.
Le/NNP poisson/NN était/NN fondant/JJ en/JJ bouche/NN ./.
Pour/NNP finir/NN les/VBZ prix/NN sont/NN tout/NN à/VBD fait/JJ correct/NN ./.
Le/NNP tout/VBD etait/JJ très/NNS honnête/NN ./.
J'allais/NNP oublier/NN ,/, dans/NNS ce/VBP restaurant/JJ il/NN y/NN a/DT des/VBZ box/NN de/IN Bois/NNP avec/NNP des/VBZ banquettes/NNS à/RB l'intérieur/VBP ./.
On/IN peut/NN les/NNS fermer/VBP avec/JJ des/NNS drapées/VBZ pour/JJ plus/NN d'intimité/NN ./.
Cela/NNP a/DT beaucoup/NN amusé/NN mes/NNS filles/NNS :/: )/JJ bref/NN pittoresque/NN en/VBN plus/NNS ./.
Been/NNP here/RB twice/NN --/: one/CD time/NN for/IN dinner/NN at/IN the/DT sushi/NN bar/NN and/CC the/DT second/JJ time/NN for/IN take/NN out/NN and/CC both/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT very/RB mediocre/JJ experience/NN ./.
The/DT location/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, near/IN the/DT Harbourfront/NNP and/CC the/DT Music/NNP Garden/NNP and/CC marina/NNP ,/, surrounded/VBD by/IN tons/NNS of/IN condo/NN developments/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT only/RB restaurant/JJ west/NN of/IN Spadina/NNP near/IN the/DT Harbourfront/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ too/RB bad/JJ as/IN this/DT area/NN really/RB needs/VBZ more/RBR quality/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
I/PRP live/VBP just/RB a/DT block/NN away/RB ./.
My/NNP dinner/NN there/EX just/RB okay/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD prompt/JJ and/CC courteous/JJ ./.
The/DT on-the-house/JJ amuse/NN bouche/NN at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT joke/NN :/: a/DT deep/NN fried/VBN piece/NN of/IN maki/NN ,/, over-fried/JJ to/TO the/DT point/NN where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD hard/JJ to/TO tell/NN what/WP it/PRP was/VBD ./.
I/PRP had/VBD an/DT horrifying/JJ thought/NN that/IN it/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT left/NN over/IN piece/NN of/IN sushi/NN that/IN was/VBD battered/VBN and/CC deep/VB fried/JJ ./.
The/DT second/JJ amuse/NN was/VBD a/DT simple/JJ spoonful/NN of/IN soba/NN in/IN a/DT soy/JJ mushroom/NN broth/NN --/: not/RB bad/JJ ./.
I/PRP could/MD do/VB without/IN these/DT complementary/JJ offerings/NNS ./.
The/DT restaurnant/NN is/VBZ run/VBN by/IN Koreans/NNP which/WDT explains/NNS for/IN the/DT Korean/NNP dishes/VBZ on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB feel/VB like/IN having/NN Korean/NNP food/NN and/CC had/VBD an/DT assortment/NN of/IN sushi/NN ,/, maki/NN and/CC sashimi/JJ instead/NNS ./.
The/DT quality/NN was/VBD generally/RB okay/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN freshness/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN cuts/NNS ./.
The/DT sushi/NN rice/NN was/VBD at/IN least/JJS properly/RB seasoned/VBN (/NN though/IN a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT light/JJ side/NN )/NN which/WDT is/VBZ key/JJ starting/NN point/NN to/TO a/DT good/JJ sushi/NN ,/, the/DT cut/NN of/IN fish/NN is/VBZ ample/NN ,/, however/RB I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT cuts/NNS of/IN some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ raw/NN fish/NN to/TO be/VB rather/RB poor/JJ ./.
Their/NNP hamachi/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB seem/VB to/TO be/VB actually/RB hamachi/NN and/CC I/PRP found/VBP their/PRP$ ``/`` hamachi/NN ''/'' along/NN with/IN their/PRP$ other/JJ white/JJ fish/NN to/TO be/VB rather/RB tough/JJ and/CC stringy/JJ which/NN is/VBZ a/DT sign/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB getting/VBG a/DT quality/NN cut/NN of/IN sushi-grade/NN fish/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO spit/VB out/RP a/DT couple/NN pieces/NNS into/IN my/JJ napkin/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD way/VBN too/RB stringy/JJ ./.
The/DT two/CD sushi/NN chefs/NNS at/IN the/DT bar/NN were/VBD polite/RB ,/, but/CC very/RB quiet/JJ and/CC not/RB as/RB social/JJ as/IN your/PRP$ typical/JJ Japanese/JJ sushi/NN chefs/NNS --/: they/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB more/RBR fixated/VBN on/IN the/DT Just/NNP for/IN Laughs/NNPS Gags/NNP that/IN was/VBD annoyingly/RB playing/RB on/IN their/PRP$ large/JJ flatscreen/NN TV/NN ./.
The/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT bar/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT sticky/JJ side/NN (/NN just/RB like/IN another/DT reviewer/NN 's/POS comments/NNS on/IN the/DT dining/NN tables/NNS )/NN and/CC so/RB was/VBD their/PRP$ plastic/JJ covered/VBN menus/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ off/NN putting/VBG ./.
The/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT dinner/NN was/VBD very/RB pricey/JJ considering/VBG the/DT second/JJ rate/NN quality/NN and/CC cuts/NNS of/IN the/DT fish/JJ ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB Guirei/NNP another/DT chance/NN by/IN ordering/JJ takeout/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB the/DT whitefish/hamachi/JJ sushi/NN and/CC sashimi/JJ pieces/NNS were/VBD still/RB tough/JJ and/CC stringy/JJ (/NNS I/PRP only/RB ate/VBP one/CD piece/NN and/CC spat/NN or/CC threw/NN out/IN the/DT rest/NN )/NN along/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN tuna/NN ./.
The/DT wakame/NN salad/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, though/IN the/DT portion/NN was/VBD rather/RB small/JJ and/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB any/DT leak-proof/NN containers/NNS for/IN it/PRP as/IN the/DT dressing/NN leaked/VBD out/IN of/IN it/PRP (/VBZ at/IN least/JJS they/PRP did/VBD put/VB it/PRP in/IN a/DT separate/JJ plastic/JJ bag/NN that/WDT was/VBD tightly/RB tied/VBN closed/NN )/NN ./.
Next/NNP time/NN I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB go/VB to/TO Ichiban/NNP Fish/NNP further/NNP east/NN on/IN Queen/NNP 's/POS Quay/NN ./.
The/DT quality/NN and/CC taste/NN of/IN their/PRP$ sushi/NN and/CC other/JJ dishes/NNS are/VBP much/RB better/JJR than/IN Geirei/NNP ,/, and/CC never/RB disappoints/NNS ,/, and/CC is/VBZ cheaper/RB as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT sushi/NN here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP gone/NN over/IN lunch/NN time/NN with/IN my/PRP$ colleagues/NN since/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ near/IN our/PRP$ office/NN ./.
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP 're/VBP slow/JJ as/IN molasses/NNS ./.
You/PRP can/MD expect/VB a/DT work/NN lunch/NN to/TO run/VB almost/RB 2/CD hours/NNS even/RB if/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ reasonably/RB empty/NN ./.
Not/RB the/DT best/NN ./.
Not/RB impressed/VBN with/IN this/DT place/NN at/IN all/DT !/NNP
I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN here/RB many/JJ times/NNS and/CC it/PRP gets/VBZ increasingly/RB disappointing/VBG every/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT sushi/NN pizza/NN is/VBZ more/RBR like/IN a/DT flat/JJ bread/JJ sushi/NN pizza/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ almost/RB like/IN fried/VBN toffee/NN when/WRB you/PRP try/VBP and/CC chew/VB it/PRP .../-NONE- ./. very/RB gross/JJ ./.
The/DT gyoza/NN is/VBZ okay/NN ,/, cooked/VBD well/RB and/CC very/RB tasty/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT seaweed/NN salad/NN is/VBZ horrible/JJ ./.
The/DT maki/NN 's/POS and/CC hand/NN rolls/NNS are/VBP never/RB spectacular/JJ ./.
And/CC you/PRP know/VB this/DT would/MD all/VB be/VB forgivable/JJ if/IN this/DT place/NN was/VBD cheap/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ pricey/NN for/IN what/WP you/PRP 're/VBP getting/VBG ./.
I/PRP would/MD pass/VB on/IN this/DT one/CD ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN Katsu/NNP tonight/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD horrible/JJ the/DT rice/NN when/WRB I/PRP opened/VBP it/PRP looked/VBD half/DT eaten/NN and/CC also/RB found/VBD a/DT hair/NN in/IN it/PRP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD cold/JJ ./.
Maybe/NNP they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB me/PRP and/CC gave/VBD me/PRP someone/NN 's/POS left/NN overs/NNS ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN 2/CD thin/JJ chicken/NN cutlets/NNS ,/, 1/NN was/VBD good/JJ the/DT other/JJ awful/JJ ./.
Chicken/NNP had/VBD weird/VBN texture/NN when/WRB biting/JJ into/IN it/PRP like/IN .../: Rubbery/NNP carrot/NN .../: Not/RB impressed/VBN did/VBD not/RB eat/VB even/RB 1/3/CD of/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
$/$ 15.58/CD a/DT bit/NN pricey/NN especially/RB for/IN rice/NN from/IN a/DT trash/JJ bin/NN &/CC mutant/NN ,/, freezer/NN burned/VBD expired/VBN chicken/NN ./.
Hungry/NNP buyer/NNP beware/NN ,/, maybe/NN disappointed/VBD ./.
For/IN take/NN out*/NN Sorry/NNP Guirei/NNP but/CC I/PRP was/VBD not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
This/DT place/NN looks/VBZ well/RB past/JJ its/PRP$ sell/NN by/IN date/NN ;/: the/DT kitchen/NN viewed/VBD from/IN the/DT delivery/NN area/NN has/VBZ a/DT real/JJ unclean/JJ feel/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.
This/DT was/VBD probably/RB the/DT worst/NN sushi/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
The/DT gyoza/NN was/VBD dried-out/JJ and/CC basically/RB inedible/JJ ./.
The/DT sashimi/NN sliced/VBD far/RB too/RB thickly/RB ./.
The/DT sushi/NN pizza/NN was/VBD also/RB v/JJ poor/NN ./.
And/CC $/$ 65/CD for/IN 2/CD peeps/NNS ,/, never/RB again/RB ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ not/RB many/JJ restaurant/JJ options/NNS in/IN this/DT part/NN of/IN town/NN ./.
I/PRP heard/VBD good/JJ reviews/NNS from/IN people/NNS that/WDT live/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ was/VBD reasonably/RB priced/VBN and/CC decent/JJ quality/NN sushi/NN ./.
From/NNP the/DT outside/NN ,/, Guirei/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB look/VB too/RB exciting/VBG ./.
There/EX is/VBZ patio/NN which/WDT was/VBD closed/VBN given/IN the/DT cold/NN weather/NN ./.
But/CC do/VBP n't/RB judge/VB a/DT book/NN by/IN its/PRP$ cover/NN ,/, Guirei/NNP offered/VBD a/DT cozy/NN dining/VBG experience/NN inside/NN ,/, with/IN low/JJ lighting/NN against/IN dark/JJ furniture/NN ./.
As/IN well/RB ,/, the/DT windows/NNS are/VBP big/JJ so/IN you/PRP get/VBP a/DT nice/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT street//NN We/PRP started/VBD off/RP with/IN warm/NN sake-an/JJ excellent/JJ beginning/NN on/IN a/DT cold/NN and/CC rainy/NN evening/NN !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD fast/VBN and/CC attentive/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP shortly/RB and/CC our/PRP$ food/NN arrived/VBD within/IN .../: 5-10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
They/PRP did/VBD start/VB the/DT meal/NN with/IN an/DT amuse/JJ bouche/NN --/: -fried/JJ sushi/NN ?/.
lol/NN tasted/VBD good/JJ ./.
This/DT was/VBD followed/VBN by/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN soup/NN with/IN thin/JJ noodles/NNS ,/, not/RB sure/JJ what/WP exactly/RB it/PRP was/VBD called/VBN ,/, but/CC tasted/VBN yummy/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT dragon/JJ roll-on/NN the/DT sushi/NN quality/NN scale/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB it/PRP was/VBD above/VBN sushi/NN on/IN bloor/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB at/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN a/DT high/JJ end/NN sushi/NN place/NN ./.
The/DT fish/JJ selection/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ tasting/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP enjoyed/VBN it/PRP ./.
My/NNP friend/NN had/VBD the/DT dinner/NN special/NN with/IN teriakyi/NN salmon/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT large/JJ serving/VBG size/NN ,/, he/PRP could/MD barely/RB finish/VB it/PRP !/.
He/PRP enjoyed/VBD his/PRP$ meal/NN and/CC agreed/VBD the/DT quality/NN level/NN was/VBD above/JJ average/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT good/JJ dining/NN experience/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD affordably/RB priced/VBN ./.
The/DT ambience/NN itself/NN was/VBD relaxed/VBN ./.
I/PRP would/MD say/VB the/DT tables/NNS were/VBD half/VBN filled/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT was/VBD on/IN a/DT weekday/JJ evening/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD return/VB to/TO Guirei/NNP again/NNP for/IN lunch/NN or/CC dinner/NN ./.
Definitely/RB a/DT go/NN to/TO place/NN for/IN waterfront/NN locals/NNS :/: )/JJ
Had/IN the/DT lunch/NN specials/NNS ,/, ,/, found/VBD both/DT the/DT bento/NN box/NN and/CC sushi/NN to/TO be/VB below/IN average/NN ./.
Was/NNP n't/RB a/DT bad/JJ price/NN for/IN lunch/NN but/CC was/VBD not/RB satisfied/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD decent/JJ portions/NNS though/IN ./.
Would/NNP not/RB go/VB out/IN of/IN my/NN way/NN for/IN this/DT place/NN
Service/NNP is/VBZ bad/JJ ./.
The/DT guys/NNS cheer/NN you/PRP at/IN the/DT entrance/NN only/RB to/TO forget/NN about/IN your/PRP$ existence/NN second/NN after/IN ./.
When/WRB you/PRP finally/RB call/VBP them/PRP and/CC ask/NN to/TO do/VB their/PRP$ job/NN ,/, they/PRP look/VBP very/RB busy/JJ ,/, even/RB with/IN the/DT place/NN almost/RB empty/JJ ./.
Once/IN we/PRP 've/VBP arrived/VBN there/RB 10/CD minutes/NNS before/IN the/DT lunch/NN time/NN end/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD denied/VBN the/DT lunch/NN menu/NN nevertheless/NN ./.
The/DT server/NN have/VBP n't/RB change/VBN her/PRP mind/NN even/RB after/IN politely/RB pointing/VBG out/RP that/IN we/PRP still/RB have/VBP some/DT time/NN before/IN the/DT deadline/NN ./.
Place/NNP is/VBZ not/RB that/IN awfully/RB dirty/JJ ,/, but/CC quite/RB ``/`` used/NNP ''/'' ,/, not/RB maintained/VBN well/RB ./.
You/PRP can/MD actually/RB stick/VB to/TO the/DT table/JJ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP lucky/JJ to/TO get/VB the/DT one/CD greasy/NN enough/RB ./.
Food/NNP itself/NNP is/VBZ just/RB ``/`` ok/NN ''/'' for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO find/VB decent/JJ sushi/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP ,/, and/CC Guirei/NNP is/VBZ definitely/RB not/RB an/DT impressive/JJ spot/NN menu-wise/NN ./.
Nothing/NN really/RB bad/JJ ,/, neither/JJ anything/NN to/TO dream/VB about/IN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT government/NN housing/NN next/JJ block/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB fun/JJ to/TO have/VB around/VBN while/IN waiting/NN for/IN a/DT streetcar/NN ,/, or/CC getting/VBG out/IN of/IN the/DT parking/NN to/TO the/DT normally/RB packed/VBN Lakeshore/NNP West/NNP ./.
PROS/NNS :/: A/DT nice/JJ quiet/NN spot/NN on/IN the/DT waterfront/NN ,/, including/VBG a/DT patio/NN out/IN front/NN ./.
Good/NNP sushi/sashimi/NN plus/VBZ other/JJ items/NNS (/NNS like/IN Bibimbap/NNP )/NNP ./.
CONS/NNS :/: The/DT interior/NN could/MD use/VB a/DT fresh/JJ color/coat/NN of/IN paint/NN ,/, and/CC staff/NN must/MD do/VB a/DT better/JJR job/NN of/IN providing/VBG the/DT bill/NN in/IN a/DT timely/RB manner/NN ;/: often/RB times/NNS I/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB find/RB a/DT sever/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO pay/VB the/DT bill/NN !/.
Ate/NNP here/RB again/RB last/JJ night/NN and/CC I/PRP just/RB have/VBP to/TO say/VB I/PRP am/VBP so/RB lucky/JJ to/TO live/VB a/DT five/CD minute/JJ walk/NN from/IN this/DT hidden/JJ gem/NN ./.
I/PRP eat/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN sushi/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT place/NN is/VBZ pure/RB quality/NN ./.
Beautiful/NNP presentation/NN ,/, fresh/JJ fish/JJ ,/, perfect/JJ portion/NN sizes/NNS ./.
Just/NNP such/VBD a/DT cute/JJ little/JJ place/NN too/RB ./.
Very/NNP unassuming/JJ staff/NN who/WP always/RB thank/VBP you/PRP when/WRB you/PRP leave/VBP .../: Or/NNP at/IN least/JJS they/PRP do/VBP to/TO me/VB .../: Maybe/NNP because/IN I/PRP go/VBP so/RB often/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT premium/NN ,/, high/JJ class/NN restaurant/JJ people/NNS ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VBP amazing/VBG sushi/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB disappointed/JJ ./.
Decor/NNP ,/, atmosphere/RB is/VBZ average/JJ ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT very/RB average/fair/JJ pricing/NN ,/, comparable/JJ to/TO many/JJ other/JJ sushi/NN joints/NNS ./.
I/PRP get/VBP take/JJ out/IN when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP too/RB lazy/JJ to/TO travel/NN farther/NN for/IN better/JJR or/CC cheaper/JJR sushi/NN joints/NNS ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ OK/NNP ,/, turnover/NN of/IN servers/NNS is/VBZ high/JJ ,/, so/RB service/RB is/VBZ something/NN that/IN will/MD be/VB a/DT hit/NN or/CC miss/NN ./.
Guirei/NNP is/VBZ average/JJ at/IN best/JJS ./.
A/DT nice/JJ little/JJ Japanese/JJ restaurant/NN on/IN the/DT Queens/NNP Quay/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN 's/POS favourite/JJ non/JJ AYCE/NNP ./.
A/DT typical/JJ Japanese/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN decor/NN and/CC food/NN selection/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN thoroughly/RB enjoys/VBZ the/DT place/NN because/IN she/PRP finds/VBZ the/DT sushi/NN to/TO be/VB very/RB fresh/JJ tasting/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ places/NNS that/WDT actually/RB offers/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ soft/NN shell/NN crab/NN as/IN a/DT dish/JJ which/WDT she/PRP absolutely/RB loves/NNS ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN as/IN I/PRP live/VBP close-by/JJ ,/, it/PRP failed/VBD on/IN service/NN ,/, food/NN ,/, ambience/NN ,/, pretty/RB much/JJ everything/NN ./.

Service/NNP was/VBD non/JJ existent/NN ,/, just/RB took/VBD our/NN orders/NNS ,/, dropped/VBD off/RP the/DT food/NN ,/, did/VBD n't/RB ask/VB if/IN everything/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ,/, did/VBD not/RB refill/VB our/PRP$ (/NN lukewarm/NN )/NN tea/NN ./.
Ordered/IN the/DT LA/NNP Ribs/NNP ,/, they/PRP were/VBD ok/JJ ,/, nothing/NN special/NN ./.
The/DT accompanying/JJ rice/NN was/VBD cold/JJ and/CC hard/JJ ,/, the/DT miso/NN soup/NN also/RB lukewarm/NN and/CC overly/RB salty/NN ./.
Also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT lobster/NN roll/NN and/CC dragon/NN roll/NN with/IN salmon/NN ./.
Worst/NNP rolls/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ,/, rolled/VBN so/RB loosely/RB that/IN they/PRP fell/VBD apart/NN right/NN when/WRB we/PRP lifted/VBD them/PRP off/IN the/DT plate/NN ./.
Tiny/NNP slivers/NNS of/IN fish/JJ and/CC just/RB a/DT terrible/JJ presentation/NN ./.
Cleanliness/NN is/VBZ terrible/JJ ,/, the/DT soy/JJ sauce/NN container/NN was/VBD filthy/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD black/NN for/IN some/DT reason/NN ,/, probably/RB a/DT combination/NN of/IN being/VBG dirty/NN and/CC refilled/VBD too/RB many/JJ times/NNS ./.
Also/RB an/DT ``/`` old/JJ ''/'' dirty/NN smell/NN in/IN the/DT dining/NN room/NN ,/, with/IN flies/NNS buzzing/VBG around/IN everywhere/NN ./.

I/PRP ordered/VBP take/JJ out/NN here/RB last/JJ week/NN ./.
Sub-par/JJ sushi/NN in/IN all/DT aspects/NNS ./.
There/EX are/VBP way/VBG to/TO many/JJ affordable/JJ and/CC good/JJ sushi/NN restaurants/NNS in/IN this/DT city/NN to/TO even/RB justify/VB eating/JJ here/RB ./.
I/PRP live/VBP close/JJ by/IN and/CC thought/VBD I/PRP might/MD as/RB well/RB try/IN it/PRP ,/, wish/JJ I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB ./.
My/NNP neighbourhood/NN is/VBZ lacking/VBG good/JJ take/NN out/RP sushi/NN !/.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT sushi/NN fan/NN ,/, but/CC friends/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP taken/VBN here/RB tell/JJ me/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ ./.
My/NNP favourite/NN is/VBZ the/DT chicken/NN teriyaki/NN ,/, which/WDT comes/NNS with/IN rice/NN and/CC miso/NN soup/NN ./.
Tempura/NNP and/CC gyoza/NNP appetizers/NNS are/VBP also/RB delicious/JJ ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ dad/NN loves/VBZ the/DT green/JJ salad/NN with/IN apple/NN ,/, avacado/NN ,/, and/CC house/NN dressing/NN ./.
Very/NNP popular/VBD with/IN locals/NNS ,/, family/NN atmosphere/RB ./.
Private/NNP booths/NNS ,/, take-out/JJ ,/, delivery/NN ,/, patio/NN ,/, valet/JJ parking/NN ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB get/VB any/DT better/JJR than/IN this/DT ./.
Pricey/NNP but/CC not/RB prohibitive/JJ ,/, Guirei/NNP gets/NNS my/VBP vote/NN for/IN prompt/NN ,/, polite/NNS ,/, and/CC accommodating/VBG customer/NN service/NN (/NNS if/IN not/RB the/DT most/RBS generous/JJ of/IN sushi/NN servings/NNS )/NN ./.
Given/NNP a/DT choice/NN between/IN another/DT neighbourhood/NN sushi/NN restaurant/NN ,/, Mi-Ne/NNP on/IN Bremner/NNP ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD go/VB here/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT superior/NN customer/NN service/NN alone/RB ./.
At/IN Guirei/NNP ,/, you/PRP can/MD customize/VB your/PRP$ roll/NN with/IN extra/JJ charges/NNS but/CC no/DT fuss/NN and/CC no/DT attitude/NN ./.
Plus/NNP ,/, Ikura/NNP is/VBZ on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ key/JJ for/IN Ikura/NNP fans/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN the/DT Uni/NNP filled/VBD Viagra/NNP roll/NN twice/NN and/CC ordered/NN Uni/IN sushi/NN ,/, Ikura/NNP ,/, Tobiko/NNP sushi/NNP ,/, Unagi/NNP ,/, salmon/JJ sashimi/NN ,/, miso/NN soup/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT Alaska/NNP roll/NN :/: all/DT served/VBN fresh/NN ,/, all/DT delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT miso/NN soup/NN was/VBD served/VBN hot/NN ,/, the/DT fish/JJ was/VBD fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ meal/NN delivered/NN without/IN a/DT glitch/NN ./.
Out/IN of/IN 3/NNP visits/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN 3/VBN positive/JJ dining/NN experiences/NNS at/IN this/DT location/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ ,/, refilling/VBG our/PRP$ tea/NN and/CC water/NN promptly/RB ,/, and/CC easily/RB accommodating/VBG our/PRP$ request/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT Uni/NNP served/VBD separately/RB (/JJ boyfriend/NN is/VBZ allergic/JJ to/TO shellfish/JJ )/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN promptly/RB and/CC served/VBN with/IN equal/JJ speed/NN ./.
Note/NN to/TO large/JJ groups/NNS :/: dinner/JJ time/NN seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB especially/RB busy/NN for/IN this/DT location/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN my/PRP$ recent/JJ experience/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN filled/VBN with/IN groups/NNS of/IN customers/NNS around/IN 7.30pm/CD :/: make/VB a/DT reservation/NN ./.
So/RB why/WRB the/DT 3/NN stars/NNS ?/.
The/DT sushi/NN servings/NNS ,/, while/IN fresh/JJ ,/, are/VBP smaller/JJR in/IN size/NN ,/, comparatively/RB speaking/VBG ./.
And/CC the/DT prices/NNS ,/, in/IN direct/JJ comparison/NN to/TO Gonoe/NNP Japanese/NNP restaurant/VBD (/VBN located/VBN on/IN the/DT Queen/NNP 's/POS Quay/NNP )/NNP is/VBZ more/JJR expensive/JJ ,/, sometimes/RB by/IN a/DT dollar/NN per/IN order/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT fish/JJ is/VBZ high/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN well/RB on/IN every/DT visit/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT pinch/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN delivers/VBZ a/DT good/JJ meal/NN ,/, in/IN a/DT convenient/JJ location/NN ./.
My/NNP vote/NN :/: Ikura/NNP Girl/NNP approved/NNP ./.
I/PRP live/VBP in/IN the/DT states/NN and/CC we/PRP simply/RB do/VBP not/RB have/VB sushi/JJ pizza/NN but/CC this/DT place/NN has/VBZ it/PRP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
Love/NNP the/DT location/NN and/CC everything/NN i/NN have/VBP had/VBN there/RB is/VBZ fantastic/JJ ./.
Casual/NNP and/CC wonderful/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT patio/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD sit/VB out/RP and/CC look/NN at/IN the/DT water/NN ./.
I/PRP truly/RB go/VBD out/IN of/IN my/PRP$ way/NN to/TO to/TO to/TO this/DT place/NN ./.
What/NN 's/VBZ with/IN the/DT hate/NN ,/, guys/NNS ?/.
I/PRP mean/VBP granted/VBN I/PRP would/MD n't/RB really/VB come/VBN here/RB for/IN dinner/NN and/CC I/PRP do/VBP live/RB a/DT block/NN away/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP really/RB do/VBP think/RB that/IN their/PRP$ lunch/NN specials/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB great/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN the/DT LA/NNP ribs/NNS and/CC the/DT black/NN cod/NN teriyaki/NN ,/, and/CC both/DT were/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT bento/NN boxes/NNS are/VBP a/DT particularly/RB good/JJ deal/NN since/IN they/PRP come/VBP with/IN salad/JJ ,/, tempura/NN ,/, and/CC 2/CD small/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN yam/NN sushi/NN ,/, soup/NN and/CC rice/NN along/NN with/IN the/DT portion/NN of/IN whatever/NN you/PRP 're/VBP getting/VBG ./.
Having/VBG gotten/VBN takeout/NN before/IN ,/, you/PRP definitely/RB get/VBP a/DT smaller/JJR portion/NN of/IN everything/NN ,/, so/RB from/IN a/DT value/NN perspective/JJ ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB recommend/VB going/VBG this/DT route/NN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ pleasant/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP got/VBD what/WP I/PRP needed/VBD out/IN of/IN them/PRP ,/, so/RB I/PRP have/VBP no/DT complaints/NNS ./.
Absolutely/RB the/DT worst/NN sushi/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
The/DT salmon/NN appears/VBZ to/TO have/VB gone/NN through/IN a/DT microwave/JJ (/NN see/VB my/PRP$ photo/NN )/NN ,/, tuna/NN is/VBZ flaking/VBG and/CC grey/NN ./.
So/RB bad/JJ we/PRP sent/VBP it/PRP back/RB ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP popped/VBD into/IN Guirei/NNP out/IN of/IN convenience/NN the/DT other/JJ evening/NN after/IN attending/VBG an/DT event/NN at/IN the/DT community/NN centre/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
We/PRP found/VBD the/DT place/NN to/TO be/VB clean/JJ and/CC we/PRP were/VBD happy/NN to/TO be/VB seated/VBN at/IN a/DT (/JJ paper/NN )/NN walled/VBD in/IN booth/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD the/DT $/$ 49.95/CD Gui/NNP special/NNP for/IN two/CD people/NNS ./.
First/NNP they/PRP brought/VBD a/DT little/JJ amuse/NN bouche/NN of/IN a/DT couple/NN pieces/NNS of/IN deep/NN fried/VBN maki/NN and/CC a/DT miniature/NN noodle/NN soup/NN ./.
The/DT salad/JJ followed/NN which/WDT I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB enjoy/VB as/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT slightly/JJ slimy/NN mixture/NN of/IN fresh/JJ and/CC pickled/JJ vegetables/NNS ./.
Miso/NNP soup/VBD arrived/VBN with/IN the/DT salad/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD fine/NN ./.
The/DT tempura/NN was/VBD next/JJ and/CC that/DT was/VBD my/VBN favourite/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD fresh/JJ from/IN the/DT fryer/NN and/CC included/VBD 3/JJ shrimp/NN and/CC a/DT variety/NN of/IN vegetables/NNS ./.
Our/NNP sushi/sashimi/maki/NNP platter/NN was/VBD next/JJ which/NN had/VBD a/DT few/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN salmon/NN and/CC tuna/NN sashimi/NN (/IN the/DT salmon/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, the/DT tuna/NN was/VBD mediocre/JJ )/NN ,/, a/DT few/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN sushi/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT very/RB average/JJ california/NN roll/NN ./.
Next/NNP came/VBD our/PRP$ teriyaki/NN chicken/NN which/WDT we/PRP selected/VBD from/IN a/DT choice/NN of/IN chicken/NN ,/, beef/NN ,/, or/CC salmon/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD fine/NN ,/, better/RBR quality/JJ chicken/NN than/IN most/JJS teriyakis/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ,/, but/CC nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN ./.
A/DT scoop/NN of/IN green/JJ tea/NN ice/NN cream/NN rounded/VBD out/RP our/PRP$ meal/NN with/IN a/DT beautifully/RB presented/JJ slice/NN of/IN orange/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC they/PRP timed/VBD the/DT arrival/NN of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS perfectly/RB ./.
We/PRP got/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN but/CC I/PRP still/RB think/VBP $/$ 49.95/CD was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ steep/NN ./.
I/PRP might/MD go/VB back/RB if/IN I/PRP were/VBD in/IN the/DT area/NN but/CC would/MD probably/RB make/VB the/DT 10min/CD hike/NN up/IN to/TO King/NNP St./NNP for/IN a/DT wider/NN variety/NN of/IN restaurant/JJ options/NNS ./.
Been/NNP here/RB countless/JJ times/NNS ,/, always/RB good/JJ food/NN ,/, always/RB excellent/JJ a/DT service/NN ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP ok/JJ considering/VBG the/DT area/NN is/VBZ expensive/JJ ./.
They/PRP always/RB have/VBP the/DT house/NN amuse/VBP bouche/JJ noodles/NNS and/CC fried/VBN fish/JJ which/WDT elevates/VBZ the/DT experience/NN ./.
They/PRP frequently/VBP have/VBP specials-/JJ look/NN for/IN the/DT sign/NN when/WRB you/PRP first/RB come/VBP in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
Slow/JJ service/NN and/CC more/JJR expensive/JJ then/RB the/DT usual/JJ sushi/NN spot/NN ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN people/NNS waiting/VBG on/IN their/PRP$ dinner/NN and/CC no/DT waitress/NN in/IN sight/NN !/.
More/NNP expensive/VBD to/TO eat/NN in/IN then/RB take/VB out/RP ./.
I/PRP went/VBD to/TO there/NNP only/RB one/CD time/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ very/RB close/JJ by/IN my/PRP$ house/NN also/RB I/PRP love/JJ sushi/NN ./.
that/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO try/NNP here/RB ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP ``/`` chirashi/NN don/NN ''/'' ./.
It/PRP was/VBD fine/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN special/NN ./.
Came/NN in/IN for/IN the/DT bulgogi/NN lunch/NN bento/NN box/NN and/CC a/DT ``/`` three/CD musketeers/NNS ''/'' roll/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP got/VBD my/PRP$ order/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN by/IN how/WRB skimpy/JJ the/DT roll/NN looked/VBD but/CC ,/, on/IN further/JJ reflection/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN exactly/RB as/IN advertised/JJ ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP got/VBD too/RB excited/VBN ./.
The/DT bulgogi/NN was/VBD perfectly/RB cooked/VBN ,/, tasted/VBN great/JJ ./.
The/DT tempura/NN worked/VBD too/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT miso/NN soup/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ addition/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, no/DT complaints/NNS ./.
Its/PRP$ location/NN near/IN the/DT airport/NN will/MD serve/VB me/PRP well/RB in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
Been/NNP here/RB several/JJ times/NNS ./.
Fantastic/JJ menu/NN ,/, reasonable/JJ prices/NNS (/VBD especially/RB as/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ tourist/NN Haven/NNP ,/, Queen/NNP 's/POS Quay/NN ./.
Friendly/RB unpretentious/JJ service/NN too/RB ./.
Our/NNP regular/JJ Sushi/NNP take-out/NN place/NN was/VBD n't/RB delivering/VBG last/JJ night/NN due/JJ to/TO street/NN closures/NNS for/IN the/DT MMVAs/NNPS so/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP from/IN this/DT place/NN via/IN justeat/NN ./.
Ordered/NNP at/IN 7:45/CD and/CC by/IN 9PM/CD ,/, the/DT food/NN still/RB had/VBD n't/RB arrived/VBN (/IN we/PRP live/VBP just/RB over/IN 1KM/CD away/RB )/RB ./.
I/PRP called/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC the/DT lady/NN on/IN the/DT line/NN could/MD n't/RB even/RB tell/VB me/PRP for/IN certain/NN that/IN the/DT food/NN had/VBD been/VBN made/VBN ,/, let/JJ alone/NN when/WRB it/PRP would/MD arrive/VB ./.
I/PRP then/RB went/VBD on/IN live/NNS chat/NN with/IN Justeat/NNP ,/, who/WP call/IN the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC had/VBD the/DT same/JJ issues/NNS getting/VBG information/NN as/IN we/PRP did/VBD ,/, so/IN we/PRP ended/VBD up/RP cancelling/VBG the/DT order/NN and/CC ordering/VBG from/IN someone/NN else/RB instead/RB ./.
Low/NNP and/CC behold/NN ,/, at/IN 9:45PM/CD ,/, a/DT full/JJ 2/NN hours/NN since/IN we/PRP put/VBP through/IN our/PRP$ order/NN ,/, the/DT delivery/NN driver/NN called/NN from/IN the/DT street/NN to/TO say/VB he/PRP could/MD n't/RB find/VB our/PRP$ apartment/NN (/NN ever/RB heard/NN of/IN googlemaps/NNS ,/, guys/NNS ?/VBP )/NN ./.
We/PRP told/VBD him/PRP we/PRP cancelled/VBD the/DT order/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD taking/VBG way/NN too/RB long/RB ,/, and/CC sent/VBD him/PRP back/RB to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
Restaurant/JJ owners/NNS ,/, if/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB handle/VB the/DT deliveries/NNS ,/, please/NN stop/NN using/VBG justeat/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP getting/VBG really/RB tired/VBN of/IN waiting/VBG 1.5/NNS hrs/NNS +/VBP for/IN my/PRP$ food/NN ,/, or/CC never/RB having/VB it/PRP arrive/VB at/IN all/DT ./.
Decent/NNP ./.
Restaurants/NNS along/IN the/DT harbourfront/NN are/VBP surprisingly/RB limited/VBN for/IN a/DT tourist/NN area/NN ./.
With/IN options/NNS such/JJ as/IN Shoeless/NNP Joes/NNP and/CC Swiss/NNP Chalet/NNP I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN Guirei/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT better/JJR selections/NNS in/IN the/DT harbourfront/NN neighbourhood/NN ./.
Guirei/NNP 's/POS appearance/NN is/VBZ like/IN any/DT average/JJ sushi/NN restaurant/NN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
Unexpectedly/RB large/JJ on/IN the/DT inside/NN ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ dimly/RB lit/NN with/IN very/RB simple/JJ décor/NN ,/, creating/VBG a/DT casual/JJ dining/NN atmosphere/RB ./.
The/DT noise/NN level/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ also/RB quiet/JJ but/CC that/DT was/VBD probably/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/NNS were/VBD only/RB a/DT few/JJ customers/NNS eating/VBG there/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD OK/NNP ./.
They/PRP had/VBD a/DT vast/JJ amount/NN of/IN items/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN offering/IN a/DT few/JJ ``/`` dishes/NNS ''/'' that/IN veered/VBN from/IN the/DT typical/JJ sushi/NN menu/NN but/CC mostly/RB all/DT were/VBD staples/NNS ./.
Portion/NNP sizes/NNS of/IN the/DT food/NN were/VBD decent/JJ and/CC the/DT overall/JJ taste/NN was/VBD not/RB mind/JJ blowing/NN but/CC not/RB bad/JJ ./.
To/TO start/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD craving/VBG something/NN deep/NN fried/VBD ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ ``/`` Soft/NNP Shell/NNP Crab/NNP ''/'' and/CC the/DT ``/`` Agedashi/NNP Tofu/NNP ''/'' ./.
The/DT Soft/NNP Shell/NNP Crab/NNP was/VBD exactly/RB what/WP I/PRP expected/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB -/JJ battered/JJ ,/, deep/JJ fried/JJ and/CC served/VBN with/IN a/DT dipping/JJ sauce/NN ./.
In/IN terms/NNS of/IN taste/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD n't/RB anything/JJ spectacular/JJ about/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT crab/NN was/VBD subtle/NN in/IN texture/NN and/CC the/DT meat/NN was/VBD juicy/JJ .../: and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN crab/NN (/NN surprise/NN !/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT Agedashi/NNP Tofu/NNP consisted/VBD of/IN fairly/RB large/JJ tofu/NN cubes/NNS ,/, also/RB deep/VBP fried/JJ ,/, and/CC topped/VBD with/IN bonito/NN flakes/NNS ./.
On/IN the/DT first/JJ bite/NN ,/, the/DT tofu/NN is/VBZ crispy/NN but/CC the/DT middle/NN is/VBZ soft/RB ./.
The/DT sauce/NN it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN in/IN was/VBD n't/RB too/RB salty/JJ but/CC was/VBD flavourful/JJ enough/JJ to/TO complement/NN the/DT tofu/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT main/JJ ,/, the/DT ``/`` storm/NN roll/NN ''/'' caught/NN my/VBD eye/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
It/PRP consisted/VBD of/IN deep/NN fried/VBN salmon/NN with/IN avocado/NN ,/, lettuce/NN ,/, and/CC green/JJ onion/NN all/DT rolled/VBN into/IN a/DT very/RB big/JJ fat/NN sushi/NN roll/NN ./.
It/PRP had/VBD a/DT predominant/JJ salmon/NN taste/NN with/IN a/DT hint/NN of/IN spice/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB the/DT lettuce/NN belonged/VBD in/IN the/DT roll/NN as/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB add/VB anything/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD an/DT unnecessary/JJ ,/, soggy/JJ ingredient/NN that/WDT would/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN missed/VBN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT waitress/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB wait/VB very/RB long/JJ for/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
The/DT prices/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB standard/JJ for/IN sushi/NN dining/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB the/DT best/JJS in/IN Toronto/NNP but/CC definitely/RB worth/VBD a/DT try/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT neighbourhood/NN ./.
Only/RB tried/VBD the/DT sushi/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD extremely/RB fresh/JJ ;/: lots/NNS of/IN variety/NN ,/, great/JJ service/NN (/NN actual/JJ Japanese/JJ staff/NN and/CC cooks/NNS ,/, who/WP gave/-NONE- us/VBP great/JJ advice/NN ;/: and/CC did/VBD n't/RB charge/VB us/PRP for/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN rolls/NNS that/WDT were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ exotic/JJ for/IN us/PRP ./.
Nice/NNP patio/NN across/NN from/IN the/DT lake/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD quiet/JJ till/NN about/IN ./.

I/PRP lived/VBD directly/RB across/IN this/DT spot/NN for/IN a/DT couple/JJ years/NNS ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD hard/JJ not/RB to/TO give/VB this/DT one/CD a/DT try/NN ./.

Same/NNP bento/NNP box/NN offerings/NNS ,/, Maki/sushi//NNP sashimi/NNP combos/VBZ -/JJ nothing/NN too/RB amazing/VBG to/TO mention/NN ./.

Well/NNP I/PRP think/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NN why/WRB this/DT place/NN only/RB exists/VBZ is/VBZ the/DT total/JJ lack/NN of/IN restaurants/NNS of/IN any/DT sort/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT similar/JJ place/NN just/RB across/IN the/DT road/NN but/CC it/PRP looks/VBZ like/IN it/PRP has/VBZ the/DT same/JJ owner/NN because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ no/DT better/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT hidden/JJ gem/NN ./.
Got/IN the/DT unagi/JJ donburi/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT eel/NN was/VBD soft/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD just/RB right/RB ./.
Also/RB got/VBD a/DT side/NN of/IN spicy/NN scallop/NN sushi/NN .../: Omg/NNP ./.
Definitely/RB going/VBG back/RB there/RB again/RB ,/, the/DT sushi/NN quality/NN and/CC service/NN is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT king/VBG west/NN joints/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ my/RB local/JJ sushi/NN restaurant/NN so/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP here/RB a/DT lot/NN and/CC I/PRP love/VB it/PRP ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP get/VB the/DT sashimi/NN dinner/NN combo/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT good/JJ amount/NN of/IN food/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN and/CC always/RB delicious/JJ ./.
Lunch/JJ combos/NNS are/VBP also/RB well/RB priced/VBN and/CC you/PRP get/VB a/DT lot/NN ./.
Staff/NNP here/RB are/VBP friendly/RB and/CC attentive/JJ and/CC we/PRP 're/VBP always/RB welcomed/VBN with/IN big/JJ ``/`` hellos/NNS ''/'' from/IN the/DT cooks/NNS ./.
We/PRP like/VBP sitting/VBG in/IN the/DT small/JJ private/JJ booths/NNS near/IN the/DT back/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, my/NNP go-to/NN sushi/NN restaurant/NN ./.
A/DT 3-hour/JJ unscheduled/JJ break/NN at/IN work/NN without/IN any/DT food/NN prompted/VBD me/PRP to/TO finally/RB check/VB out/RP this/DT place/NN which/WDT some/DT of/IN my/PRP$ coworkers/NNS have/VBP raved/VBN about/IN ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP ordering/VBG the/DT Dinner/NNP Box/NNP A/NNP (/NNP $/$ 21/CD )/CD which/WDT came/NNS with/IN with/IN your/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN salmon/NN ,/, beef/NN ,/, or/CC chicken/NN teriyaki/NN ,/, your/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN sashimi/NN ,/, sushi/NN ,/, or/CC maki/NN ,/, shrimp/NN and/CC vegetable/JJ tempura/NN ,/, and/CC surprisingly/RB ,/, no/DT rice/NN !/.
For/IN $/$ 2/CD more/JJR ,/, the/DT Dinner/NNP Box/NNP B/NNP option/NNP included/VBD rice/NN ,/, sashimi/NN ,/, sushi/NN ,/, AND/NNP maki/NNP ;/: no/DT tempura/NN though/IN ./.
My/NNP dinner/NN was/VBD n't/RB anything/JJ special/NN ;/: the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ chewy/NN and/CC the/DT teriyaki/NN sauce/NN was/VBD pretty/RB watery/JJ in/IN consistency/NN ./.
And/CC for/IN $/$ 21/CD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN pricier/JJR than/IN the/DT typical/JJ bento/NN box/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP a/DT separate/JJ take-out/NN section/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP imagine/VBP they/PRP get/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN orders/NNS from/IN ,/, considering/VBG the/DT slim/NN pickings/NNS in/IN take-out/JJ options/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT staff/NN was/VBD friendly/RB on/IN the/DT phone/NN and/CC in-person/NN ,/, I/PRP ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, will/MD not/RB be/VB placing/VBG any/DT more/RBR take-out/JJ orders/NNS here/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ place/NN for/IN lunch/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT little/JJ pricey/NN for/IN dinner/NN (/NN hence/NN the/DT 3-star/JJ rating/NN )/NN ./.
Did/NNP I/PRP mention/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ virtually/RB in/IN the/DT lobby/NN of/IN where/WRB I/PRP live/VBP ?/.
Oh/NNP yeah/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ pretty/RB convenient/JJ ./.
For/IN lunch/NN ,/, virtually/RB all/DT of/IN the/DT bento/NN boxes/NNS are/VBP of/IN excellent/JJ value/NN --/: $/$ 10-14/CD range/-NONE- that/IN come/NN with/IN the/DT entree/NN ,/, miso/NN soup/NN ,/, tempura/NN ,/, and/CC rice/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN ./.
My/NNP favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT beef/NN terriyaki/NN bento/NN ./.
The/DT one/CD issue/NN I/PRP have/VBP with/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ that/IN their/PRP$ sashimi/NN is/VBZ cut/VBN too/RB thick/JJ ,/, and/CC many/JJ of/IN the/DT pieces/NNS are/VBP too/RB chewy/JJ as/IN a/DT result/NN (/NN or/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT lower-grade/JJ cut/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP actually/RB had/VBD to/TO COOK/NNP the/DT sashimi/NN on/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN occasions/NNS to/TO make/VB it/PRP palatable/JJ (/NN when/WRB I/PRP 've/VBP taken/VBN out/RP )/NNS --/: no/JJ joke/NN !/.
Otherwise/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB nice/JJ restaurant/NN with/IN a/DT loyal/JJ local/JJ fan/JJ base/NN ./.
I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP it/PRP for/IN lunch/NN ,/, but/CC would/MD shy/VB away/RB from/IN it/PRP for/IN dinner/NN unless/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO get/VB a/DT bit/NN spendy/NN ./.
Have/NNP eaten/VBD here/RB at/IN least/JJS 20/CD times/NNS between/IN April/NNP 2010/CD and/CC Sept/NNP 2011/CD ,/, usually/RB around/IN 3-4pm/CD ,/, mainly/RB because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT only/RB sit-down/JJ restaurant/NN within/IN a/DT ten/VBN minute/NN walk/NN from/IN my/PRP$ work/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ generally/RB very/RB fresh/JJ ./.
Pretty/NNP good/VBD dynamite/JJ roll/NN ,/, tempura/NN appetizer/NN ,/, banana/NN fritters/NNS for/IN dessert/NN ./.
I/PRP always/VBP miss/JJ the/DT lunch/NN specials/VBZ b/c/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN my/NN work/NN lunch/NN or/CC would/MD 've/VB tried/VBN that/IN long/JJ ago/NN ./.
So/IN it/PRP forces/VBZ me/PRP into/IN getting/NN two/CD a/DT la/NN carte/NN items/NNS ,/, usually/RB two/CD of/IN the/DT three/CD above/NN ,/, since/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO spend/VB $/$ 19.99/CD on/IN the/DT dinner/NN combo/NN ./.
Then/RB again/RB ,/, my/NNS bill/NN usually/RB comes/VBZ to/TO around/IN $/$ 17/CD after/IN taxes/NNS ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ 20/VBN by/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP tip/VBP ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ 90/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC stereotypical/JJ of/IN the/DT many/JJ Japanese/JJ restaurants/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN at/IN in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
All/DT smiles/NNS ,/, politeness/NNS ,/, female-only/JJ ,/, dressed/VBD in/IN cultural/JJ style/NN ./.
Usually/RB they/PRP are/VBP quite/JJ attentive/JJ ,/, making/VBG sure/IN the/DT complimentary/JJ green/JJ tea/NN is/VBZ topped/VBN up/RB ,/, your/JJ food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, etc/JJ ./.
A/DT few/JJ times/NNS I/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB very/RB long/JJ ,/, which/WDT I/PRP attribute/VBP to/TO them/PRP being/VBG short/JJ staffed/JJ maybe/NN ?/.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ never/RB really/RB busy/JJ when/WRB I/PRP go/VBP ,/, often/RB three/CD or/CC four/CD tables/NNS occupied/VBD inside/NN ,/, and/CC if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT summer/NN ,/, one/CD or/CC two/CD outside/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN on/IN the/DT patio/NN ./.
I/PRP always/VBP prefer/JJ the/DT patio/NN if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ out/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP can/MD watch/VB planes/NNS taking/VBD off/RP from/IN the/DT city/NN airport/NN ./.
Debit/NNP &/CC credit/NNP accepted/NNP ./.
Liquor/NNP licensed/VBD ./.
Great/NNP sushi/NNP ,/, terrible/JJ customer/NN service/NN ./.
They/PRP should/MD consider/VB stepping/JJ up/IN their/PRP$ game/NN since/IN a/DT brand/NN new/JJ sushi/NN place/NN opened/VBD right/RB across/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
Will/NNP NOT/NNP be/VB coming/VBG back/RB ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT worst/NN sushi/NN experience/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.
While/IN waiting/NN for/IN our/PRP$ delayed/VBN flight/NN at/IN Billy/NNP Bishop/NNP Airport/NNP ,/, we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO leave/VB the/DT terminal/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN to/TO check/NN out/IN the/DT nearby/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
I/PRP checked/VBD Yelp/NNP to/TO see/VB what/WP was/VBD around/IN and/CC unfortunately/RB Guirei/NNP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ nearby/NN open/JJ establishment/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD lunchtime/JJ ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD n't/RB that/IN busy/NN (/NN which/WDT should/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT warning/JJ sign/NN )/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT beautiful/JJ day/NN ,/, but/CC all/DT of/IN the/DT 4-person/JJ tables/NNS (/IN I/PRP was/VBD with/IN a/DT few/JJ other/JJ people/NNS )/NNS were/VBD occupied/VBN by/IN single/JJ diners/NNS ,/, so/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO cram/NN onto/NN a/DT smaller/JJR table/JJ ./.
Let/NNP me/VBD say/VB this/DT first/NN :/: the/DT service/NN was/VBD ,/, for/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN ,/, very/RB good/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD attentive/JJ and/CC understanding/NN of/IN our/PRP$ numerous/JJ complaints/NNS ./.
They/PRP could/MD do/VB a/DT little/RB more/RBR about/IN dining/JJ area/NN management/NN (/NN aka/NN ,/, making/VBG sure/JJ parties/NNS of/IN 4/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO sit/NN at/IN tiny/NN tables/NNS while/IN single/JJ diners/NNS take/VB up/RP 4-seaters/NNS )/RB ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ about/IN it/PRP ./.
And/CC now/RB on/IN to/TO the/DT food/NN .../: Our/NNP lunch/NN dishes/VBZ came/VBD out/RP soon/RB after/IN ordering/VBG (/NNS we/PRP mentioned/VBD having/VBG a/DT flight/NN to/TO catch/NN )/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD just/RB something/JJ off/IN about/IN everything/NN ./.
One/CD person/NN in/IN our/PRP$ party/NN ordered/VBD the/DT LA/NNP Shortribs/NNP (/NNP supposedly/RB a/DT special/JJ )/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD really/RB just/RB warmed/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT microwave/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT sashimi/JJ bento/NN box/NN ,/, but/CC was/VBD less/JJR than/IN impressed/VBN ./.
All/DT of/IN the/DT sashimi/NN had/VBD a/DT fishy/frozen/VBN taste/NN and/CC smell/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD an/DT immediate/JJ turnoff/NN ./.
Determined/NNP not/RB to/TO let/VB this/DT ruin/NN my/NN experience/NN ,/, I/PRP forged/VBD ahead/RB through/IN the/DT sashimi/JJ plate/NN but/CC stopped/RB all/DT together/JJ half-way/NN through/IN the/DT tuna/NN ./.
A/DT hair/NN ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, a/DT long/JJ black/NN hair/NN was/VBD found/VBN in/IN between/IN two/CD of/IN my/PRP$ sashimi/NN pieces/NNS ./.
On/IN the/DT plate/NN ,/, sure/JJ ,/, I/PRP can/MD understand/VB that/IN ./.
But/CC *in/NNP between*/VBD two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN the/DT same/JJ kind/NN of/IN sashimi/NN is/VBZ very/RB unusual/JJ ./.
Love/NNP ,/, love/NN ,/, LOVE/NNP the/DT bentobox/NN ./.
The/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT sashimi/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ but/CC nothing/NN to/TO brag/NN about/IN ./.
Definitely/RB a/DT bang/NN for/IN the/DT buck/NN :/: the/DT Bento/NNP box/NN lunch/NN ./.
Good/NNP quality/NN green/NN tea/NN and/CC nice/JJ sake/NN list/NN rounds/VBZ out/RP the/DT experience/NN Service/NN can/MD be/VB sloth/NN like/IN so/RB ask/NN for/IN the/DT check/NN when/WRB lunch/NN arrives/NNS otherwise/VBP bring/IN a/DT flare-gun/JJ to/TO get/VB the/DT attention/NN of/IN the/DT geisha/NN like/IN servers/NNS ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB even/RB remember/VB the/DT service/NN ,/, or/CC whatever/JJ people/NNS are/VBP complaining/VBG about../NN All/NN I/PRP can/MD remember/VB is/VBZ the/DT taste/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD easily/RB the/DT best/JJS sushi/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/VBN and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN at/IN 99,898/CD Sushi/NNP restaurants/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ./.
So/RB thats/VBZ about/IN 10/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT Sushi/NNP restaurant/NN population/NN on/IN King/NNP Street../NNP Ughhh/NNP ,/, the/DT worst/NN is/VBZ Sushi-Q/NNP ;/: they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB give/VB a/DT fudge/NN !/.

I/PRP got/VBD the/DT Maki/NNP and/CC Tempura/NNP dinner/NN for/IN $/$ 20.00/CD and/CC have/VBP a/DT slew/NN of/IN regrets/NNS ./.
Not/RB only/RB was/VBD the/DT sushi/NN terrible/JJ quality/NN (/NN every/DT piece/NN I/PRP picked/VBD up/RP fell/JJ apart/NN between/IN my/PRP$ chopsticks/NNS -/JJ which/WDT never/RB happens/VBZ elsewhere/RB )/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD not/RB enjoy/VB the/DT taste/NN and/CC was/VBD left/VBN feeling/JJ less/JJR than/IN satisfactory/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD the/DT real/JJ culprit/NN here/RB -/JJ TERRIBLE/NNP !/.
Not/RB only/RB did/VBD they/PRP bring/VBP us/PRP the/DT inncorrect/NN order/NN twice/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB for/IN water/NN multiple/NN times/NNS before/IN finally/RB getting/VBG our/PRP$ waters/NNS after/IN receiving/VBG our/PRP$ entree/NN ./.
Additionally/RB it/PRP took/VBD us/PRP at/IN least/JJS 20/CD minutes/NNS to/TO finally/RB get/VB the/DT attention/NN of/IN a/DT server/NN ./.
Despite/IN all/DT of/IN this/DT though/NN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP got/VBD the/DT servers/NNS attention/IN they/PRP were/VBD extremely/RB nice/JJ and/CC welcoming/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT dishes/NNS my/VBP friends/NNS got/VBD (/RB Chicken/VBN Teriyaki/NNP and/CC BiBimBap/NNP )/NNS were/VBD much/RB better/JJR than/IN my/PRP$ dish/NN ./.
