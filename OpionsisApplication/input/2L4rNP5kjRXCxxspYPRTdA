5/DT stars/NNS for/IN the/DT vegetable/JJ sandwich/NN
Fabulous/JJ .../: fabulously/RB mediocre/VB maybe/NN ./.
As/IN spring/NN is/VBZ now/RB upon/IN us/PRP in/IN 2010/CD all/DT humans/NNS have/VBP a/DT primordial/JJ instinct/NN to/TO sit/VB out/RP on/IN a/DT patio/NN with/IN a/DT beer/NN in/IN hand/NN baking/NN ourselves/NNS in/IN the/DT sun/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ recent/JJ travels/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN around/IN Yonge/NNP and/CC Dundas/NNP ,/, my/NNP coworkers/NNS and/CC I/PRP stumbled/VBD up/RP on/IN this/DT establishment/NN on/IN the/DT corner/NN of/IN Bay/NNP and/CC Edward/NNP ./.
Entering/VBG the/DT red-bricked/JJ patio/NN we/PRP took/VBD a/DT seat/NN in/IN the/DT sun/NN on/IN the/DT benches/NNS backing/NN onto/VBZ the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
We/PRP quickly/RB realized/VBD that/IN the/DT patio/NN itself/NN is/VBZ noticeably/RB sloped/VBN toward/IN the/DT street/NN so/IN the/DT bench/NN was/VBD so/RB high/JJ your/NNS knees/NNS were/VBD at/IN the/DT same/JJ height/NN as/IN the/DT table/JJ !/NN
We/PRP switched/VBD to/TO a/DT seat/NN where/WRB the/DT bench/NN backs/VBZ onto/NN the/DT sidewalk/NN ./.
That/DT was/VBD when/WRB we/PRP noticed/VBD that/IN there/NNS were/VBD literally/RB 5/JJ people/NNS here/RB ,/, including/VBG us/PRP ./.
Not/RB exactly/RB a/DT promising/NN start/NN ./.
Oh/NNP and/CC do/VBP you/PRP like/IN wicker/NN furniture/NN ?/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ./.
The/DT one/CD waitress/NN here/RB was/VBD quite/RB friendly/RB in/IN an/DT interesting/JJ ,/, casual/JJ talking/NN way/NN ./.
She/PRP made/VBD a/DT reference/NN to/TO about/IN the/DT crack-head/JJ walking/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN (/RB apparently/RB there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT crack-walk/NN )/NN and/CC how/WRB she/PRP could/MD n't/RB get/VB her/PRP iPhone/NN on/IN the/DT internet/NN ./.
Anyway/NNP ,/, we/PRP ordered/VBP our/VBN lunches/NNS ./.
A/DT grilled/JJ chicken/NN breast/NN sandwich/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN salad/NN for/IN me/PRP and/CC a/DT shrimp/NN linguini/NN for/IN my/PRP$ coworker/NN ./.
Our/NNP meals/NNS took/VBD over/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO arrive/VB .../: 30/CD minutes/NNS !/.
The/DT waitress/NN said/VBD that/IN the/DT linguini/NN took/VBD some/DT time/NN to/TO cook/NN ./.
Indeed/RB .../: too/RB long/RB in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Food/NNP wise/VBD the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD decently/RB grilled/VBN on/IN a/DT bun/NN of/IN some/DT sort/NN ./.
The/DT salad/JJ was/NN of/IN a/DT decent/JJ portion/NN of/IN mixed/VBN greens/NNS bag/NN salad/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD just/RB okay/JJ ./.
My/NNP buddy/NN seemed/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB his/PRP$ pasta/NN and/CC there/EX did/VBD appear/VB to/TO be/VB quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN shrimp/NN ./.
In/IN summary/JJ this/DT is/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ spot/NN for/IN a/DT beer/NN and/CC catching/VBG some/DT sun/NN on/IN the/DT cheap/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ only/RB average/JJ ./.
2.5/CD stars/NNS if/IN I/PRP could/MD ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP lived/VBN in/IN this/DT neighbourhood/NN for/IN 5/CD years/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB been/VBN inside/NN this/DT place/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, last/JJ night/NN we/PRP needed/VBD a/DT place/NN for/IN last-call/JJ drinks/NNS -/JJ we/PRP had/VBD 15/VBN minutes/NNS -/JJ and/CC everything/NN was/VBD closed/VBN (/JJ including/VBG ,/, might/MD I/VB add/NN ,/, the/DT Firkin/NNP on/IN Elm/NNP Street/NNP ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP says/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ open/JJ until/IN 2/CD am/NN ./.
Not/RB cool/JJ )/NN ./.
So/RB when/WRB we/PRP passed/VBD by/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC there/EX were/VBD people/NNS inside/NN ,/, we/PRP rushed/VBD in/IN ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB penalized/VBN for/IN having/RB all/DT super-drunk/NN patrons/NNS at/IN 1:45/CD a.m/NN ./.
But/CC they/PRP were/VBD all/DT older/NNS ,/, super-drunk/JJ men/NNS ./.
Still/RB ,/, everyone/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC the/DT vibe/NN was/VBD actually/RB okay/JJ ./.
The/DT bartenders/NNS were/VBD friendly/RB and/CC the/DT owner/NN was/VBD floating/VBG around/IN (/NN or/CC the/DT manager/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP was/VBD really/RB nice/JJ and/CC friendly/RB too/RB ./.
