Been/NNP here/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN times/NNS recently/RB and/CC had/VBD 2/VBN completely/RB different/JJ experiences/NNS ./.
The/DT 1st/CD time/NN was/VBD nice/JJ ./.
We/PRP sat/VBD outside/RB on/IN the/DT patio/NN and/CC listened/VBD to/TO live/NNP music/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN and/CC food/NN were/VBD both/DT pretty/JJ decent/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT great/JJ outdoor/NN bar/NN ,/, outdoor/NN stage/NN ,/, and/CC heaters/NNS on/IN the/DT patio/NN for/IN the/DT nights/NNS it/PRP gets/VBZ a/DT lil/NN chilly/NN ./.
2nd/CD time/NN we/PRP went/VBD ,/, we/PRP were/VBD very/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
We/PRP got/VBD to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN shortly/RB after/IN 8pm/CD and/CC we/PRP 're/VBP promptly/RB seated/VBN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN took/VBD our/NN drink/NN orders/NNS and/CC we/PRP ordered/VBP an/DT appetizer/NN ./.
The/DT appetizer/NN shows/VBZ ups/NNS and/CC we/PRP go/VBP to/TO place/NN our/NN order/NN ./.
This/DT all/DT happens/NNS within/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS of/IN arriving/VBG ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ then/RB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP told/VBN that/IN we/PRP will/MD only/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO order/NN fried/VBN foods/NNS because/IN the/DT kitchen/NN has/VBZ closed/VBN the/DT grill/NN ./.
None/NN of/IN us/PRP were/VBD wanting/VBG fried/JJ food/NN and/CC I/PRP ask/VBP her/PRP to/TO please/VB check/NN with/IN the/DT kitchen/NN because/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB told/RB this/DT until/NN now/RB ./.
She/PRP returns/VBD and/CC says/VBZ they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB turn/VB the/DT grill/NN back/RB on/IN ./.
We/PRP tell/VBP her/PRP we/PRP are/VBP leaving/VBG for/IN another/DT restaurant/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ ridiculous/JJ ./.
She/PRP actually/RB tells/VBZ us/PRP that/IN its/PRP$ really/NN too/RB late/JJ to/TO be/VB eating/VBG dinner/NN ./.
Haha/NNP ,/, seriously/RB ?/. ?/.
She/PRP then/RB expects/VBZ us/PRP to/TO pay/VB our/PRP$ bill/NN ./.
I/PRP pay/VBP for/IN the/DT appetizer/NN just/RB to/TO be/VB done/VBN with/IN it/PRP but/CC refuse/VB to/TO pay/NN for/IN the/DT drinks/NNS (/VBP non-alcohol/JJ )/NN when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB even/RB eating/VBG ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD for/IN a/DT to/TO go/VB box/NN for/IN the/DT appetizer/NN that/IN was/VBD worthless/JJ once/RB getting/VBG home/NN ./.
Because/IN of/IN this/DT visit/NN ,/, The/DT Patriot/NNP has/VBZ probably/RB lost/VBN our/PRP$ business/NN permanently/RB ./.
Came/NN by/IN for/IN a/DT beer/NN after/IN work/NN ./.
Used/VBN to/TO be/VB 30/VBN beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN from/IN all/DT over/IN the/DT U.S./NNP and/CC beyond/NN ./.
Seems/NNP the/DT beers/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB mainstream/JJ now/RB with/IN few/JJ local/JJ craft/NN beers/NNS ./.
Only/RB have/VBP 20/VBN beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN and/CC most/NN of/IN those/DT are/VBP Bud/NNP ,/, Bud/NNP light/NNP ,/, PBR/NNP ,/, Stella/NNP ,/, Miller/NNP Lights/NNP ,/, etc/NN ./.
Still/RB some/DT local/JJ Charlotte/NNS and/CC Ft./NNP Mill/NNP //NNP Rock/NNP Hill/NNP varieties/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT choices/NNS under/IN the/DT new/JJ management/NN are/VBP fewer/JJR and/CC far/RB between/IN ./.
A/DT shame/NN ./.
Love/NNP this/DT joint/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP could/MD go/VB to/TO any/DT dive/JJ bar/NN for/IN the/DT selection/NN they/PRP offer/VBP now/RB ./.
Food/NNP still/RB seems/VBZ decent/NN ,/, but/CC much/RB changed/VBD ./.
No/DT more/RBR Taco/NNP Tuesday/NNP ,/, so/IN that/DT 's/VBZ disappointing/VBG ./.
They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP deep/VB fried/VBN oreos/NNS ,/, so/RB there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN love/JJ I/NNS have/VBP to/TO give/VB them/PRP for/IN that/DT ./.
We/PRP 'll/VBP keep/VBN coming/VBG by/IN to/TO see/VB how/WRB things/JJ evolve/NN ./.
My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN for/IN a/DT quick/JJ bite/NN as/IN our/PRP$ home/NN is/VBZ only/RB about/IN a/DT half/NN mile/NN down/IN the/DT road/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT house/NN salad/JJ with/IN chicken/NN and/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN ordered/VBD a/DT chefs/NN salad/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD just/RB shy/JJ of/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ salads/NNS to/TO appear/VB -/JJ there/NNS were/VBD only/RB 4/CD other/JJ (/NNS 2-4/JJ top/JJ )/NN tables/NNS so/IN we/PRP were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ surprised/VBN that/IN it/PRP took/VBD so/RB long/RB ./.
What/WP was/VBD absolutely/RB amazing/JJ was/VBD that/IN my/PRP$ husbands/NNS salad/RB had/VBD at/IN least/JJS 50/CD %/NN more/RBR lettuce/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ than/IN mine/NN did/VBD LOL/NNP ./.
During/VBG our/PRP$ wait/NN we/PRP were/VBD however/VBN entertained/VBN by/IN several/JJ very/RB intoxicated/VBN people/NNS at/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD shocked/VBN to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT young/JJ bartender/NN continued/VBD to/TO pour/VB them/PRP drinks/VBZ AND/NNP shots/VBZ -/JJ believe/NNS me/IN they/PRP were/VBD banging/VBG them/PRP down/RB ./.
She/PRP was/VBD even/RB kind/JJ enough/NN to/TO pour/VB a/DT white/JJ wine/NN in/IN a/DT to/TO go/VB cup/JJ (/NNS with/IN a/DT straw/NN no/RB less/JJR )/NN for/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT drunk/NN patrons/NNS !/VBP !/.
Is/NNP n't/RB that/IN against/IN the/DT law/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN serving/JJ people/NNS that/WDT are/VBP clearly/RB over/IN the/DT limit/NN ?/.
WOW/NNP ./.
This/DT was/VBD our/VBN second/JJ time/NN (/NN very/RB bad/JJ the/DT first/JJ time/NN )/NN and/CC unfortunately/RB will/MD be/VB our/VBN last/JJ time/NN especially/NN since/IN both/DT my/NNS husband/NN and/CC I/PRP became/VBD suspiciously/RB ill/JJ after/IN eating/VBG at/IN this/DT establishment/NN ./.
My/NNP husband/NN was/VBD more/RBR ill/JJ than/IN I/PRP was/VBD -/JJ hmmm/NN maybe/NN because/IN he/PRP had/VBD more/RBR salad/JJ than/IN I/PRP did/VBD ?/.
Once/RB again/RB we/PRP will/MD wait/VB until/IN this/DT business/NN closes/NNS and/CC someone/NN else/RB gives/VBZ it/PRP a/DT shot/NN ./.
BTW/NNP prior/RB to/TO getting/VB sick/JJ I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN the/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN a/DT 3/NN rating/NN ./.
Pretty/NNP good/JJ food/NN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ mediocre/NN at/IN best/JJS ./.
Chock-full/NNP of/IN rednecks/NNS and/CC locals/NNS aka/VBP rednecks/NNS ./.
Could/NNP be/VBD a/DT great/JJ place/NN if/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB for/IN the/DT whole/JJ Tega/NNP Cay/NNP ,/, South/NNP Carolina/NNP vibe/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD bad/JJ ./.

Tried/NNP to/TO tell/VB us/PRP a/DT salad/NN did/VBD n't/RB come/VB with/IN the/DT dressing/VBG the/DT menu/NN said/VBD it/PRP did/VBD ./.
The/DT Chorizo/NNP burger/NN did/VBD n't/RB have/VB chorizo/NN or/CC the/DT pepper/NN jack/NN ./.
Took/NNP 40+/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB salad/JJ and/CC burger/JJR and/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD rather/RB empty/JJ at/IN the/DT time/NN ./.
Bad/NNP server/NN ./.

Came/NN to/TO check/NN out/IN the/DT changes/NNS now/RB that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ Patriots/NNP ./.
Very/NNP busy/NN for/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ,/, could/MD have/VB used/VBN music/JJ for/IN atmosphere/RB ./.
Found/NNP 2/VBD seats/NNS at/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, typical/JJ bar/NN food/NN but/CC menu/NN is/VBZ small/JJ in/IN choices/NNS ./.
Ordered/IN the/DT buffalo/NN grilled/VBD chicken/VBN sandwich/JJ ,/, with/IN fries/NNS and/CC a/DT side/NN salad/NN ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD for/IN the/DT salads/NNS to/TO come/VB out/RP first/JJ 3/CD times/NNS and/CC everything/NN can/MD out/VB together/RB ./.
Very/NNP disappointing/NN ,/, food/NN was/VBD average/JJ ./.

The/DT fish/JJ was/VBD awesome/JJ .../: Amazing/VBG .../:
Excellent/NNP and/CC basically/VBD the/DT reason/NN the/DT score/NN averaged/VBD up/RP to/TO a/DT 4/NN star/NN because/IN the/DT chips/NNS were/VBD nasty/JJ .../: Just/NNP French/NNP fries/VBZ that/IN tasted/VBN like/IN they/PRP were/VBD reheated/VBN leftovers/NNS from/IN lunch/NN .../: Dry/NNP and/CC rubbery/NNP .../:
So/IN how/WRB did/VBD they/PRP get/VB a/DT 4/NN star/NN ?/NN ?/. ?/.

We/PRP just/RB moved/VBD here/RB from/IN NJ/NNP and/CC our/NNP friends/NNS who/WP live/-NONE- here/RB told/VBD us/PRP to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN out/NN ,/, well/RB we/PRP were/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ we/PRP went/VBD last/JJ night/NN 5/3/16/CD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB crowded/VBN but/CC we/PRP were/VBD ok/VBN with/IN that/DT !/NN

!/NN
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ place/NN to/TO meet/VB friends/NNS for/IN a/DT good/JJ meal/NN since/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ casual/JJ and/CC just/RB loud/JJ enough/JJ to/TO encourage/NN laughter/NN and/CC fun/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Reagan/NNP ,/, a/DT ribeye/NN with/IN mashed/JJ potatoes/NNS and/CC a/DT side/NN ./.
I/PRP subbed/VBD a/DT salad/NN for/IN the/DT potatoes/NNS and/CC chose/NN seasoned/VBN vegetables/NNS ./.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD cooked/JJ perfectly/RB to/TO my/VB spec/NN of/IN med/VBN rare/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP the/DT vegetables/NNS as/IN they/PRP were/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD ordered/IN the/DT sirloin/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB complimentary/JJ of/IN the/DT juicy/NN ,/, tender/JJ quality/NN of/IN the/DT meat/NN ./.
Our/NNP dining/NN partners/NNS both/DT ordered/NNS the/DT hand-battered/JJ fish/JJ and/CC chips/NNS which/WDT looked/VBN scrumptious/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD on/IN top/JJ of/IN everything/NN we/PRP asked/VBD for/IN ,/, refilling/VBG drinks/NNS continually/RB and/CC promptly/RB getting/VBG sauces/NNS that/IN we/PRP requested/VBD ./.
Of/IN course/NN she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB many/JJ tables/NNS to/TO wait/VB on/IN because/IN the/DT restaurant/NN crowd/NN was/VBD slim/NN ;/: I/PRP 'm/VBP hoping/VBG it/PRP 's/VBZ because/IN diners/NNS just/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB about/IN this/DT gem/NN yet/RB ./.
Great/NNP food/NN ,/, great/JJ service/NN ,/, fun/JJ atmosphere/RB !/.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT really/RB good/JJ place/NN for/IN Tega/NNP Cay/Fort/NNP Mill/NNP area/NNP ./.
I/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT relatively/RB small/JJ crowd/NN ./.
Almost/NNP everyone/NN was/VBD sitting/VBG outside/NN in/IN the/DT patio/NN area/NN ./.
We/PRP chose/VBP to/TO sit/JJ inside/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD almost/RB alone/RB in/IN the/DT dining/JJ area/NN ./.
I/PRP saw/VBD the/DT picture/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP of/IN the/DT Barrel/NNP Table/NNP ,/, and/CC figured/VBD I/PRP needed/VBD to/TO sit/NN in/IN that/DT ./.
Check/NNP it/PRP out/IN if/IN available/JJ ./.
Its/PRP$ unique/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN you/PRP notice/RB here/RB is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ craft/NN beer/NN selection/NN ./.
They/PRP probably/RB have/VBP 20/VBN different/JJ beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN and/CC a/DT large/JJ selection/NN of/IN bottles/NNS ./.
First/NNP ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Unknown/NN Over/IN the/DT Edge/NNP IPA/NNP ./.
This/DT was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, on/IN my/PRP$ second/JJ I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT COAST/NNP Boy/NNP King/NNP double/JJ IPA/NNP ./.
If/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN this/DT ,/, then/RB I/PRP just/RB gave/VBD you/PRP a/DT reason/NN to/TO stop/VB what/WP you/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG right/RB now/RB ,/, and/CC drive/JJ immediately/RB to/TO Patriot/NNP and/CC order/NNP it/PRP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD fantastic/JJ ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD to/TO visit/NN Coast/NN brewery/NN in/IN Charleston/NNP earlier/JJR in/IN the/DT year/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP close/VBP relatively/RB early/RB on/IN Friday/NNP 's/POS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN Coast/JJ available/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ area/NN ./.
For/IN those/DT who/NNS do/VBP n't/RB want/VB beer/NN ,/, they/PRP had/VBD 8/VBN wines/NNS by/IN the/DT glass/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN had/VBD very/RB good/JJ red/VBN blend/NN ./.
Sorry/NNP ,/, I/PRP forget/VBP what/WP it/PRP was/VBD ./.
But/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ red/VBN blend/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
Paso/NNP or/CC something/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ selection/NN of/IN appetizers/NNS ./.
We/PRP went/VBD for/IN Fried/NNP Pickles/NNPS which/WDT were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
Sometimes/NNP friend/NN pickles/NNS can/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ greasy/NN ,/, but/CC these/DT were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, not/RB greasy/JJ ./.
For/IN food/NN ,/, my/PRP$ wife/NN and/CC daughter/NN ordered/VBD the/DT 8/CD oz/NN sirloin/NN steak/NN ,/, mashed/VBD potatoes/NNS ,/, and/CC mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN ./.
I/PRP never/VBP like/IN ordering/VBG a/DT steak/NN at/IN a/DT non-steak/JJ place/NN ,/, because/IN you/PRP usually/RB do/VBP n't/RB get/VB a/DT good/JJ steak/NN ./.
This/DT steak/NN was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ./.
Disappointing/VBG ,/, it/PRP was/VBD over/IN cooked/JJ ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ordered/NN medium/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT steak/NN was/VBD probably/RB past/JJ well/RB done/IN ./.
That/DT pretty/RB much/JJ kills/NNS a/DT steak/NN ./.
My/NNP daughter/NNP ordered/NNP medium/NN well/RB ,/, and/CC her/NNP 's/POS was/VBD n't/RB quite/RB well/RB done/RB ,/, but/CC close/RB ./.
Anyway/NNP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB recommend/VB the/DT steak/NN here/RB and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ one/CD star/NN deduction/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB the/DT only/JJ thing/NN poor/NN about/IN our/PRP$ experience/NN ./.
My/NNP daughter/NNP 's/POS boy/NN friend/NN got/VBD a/DT burger/NN and/CC he/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP got/VBD fish/JJ and/CC chips/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD recommended/VBN by/IN the/DT waitress/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
Several/JJ on/IN Yelp/NNP complained/VBD about/IN the/DT slow/NN ,/, inattentive/JJ service/NN here/RB ,/, so/RB I/PRP was/VBD mindful/JJ of/IN that/DT ,/, actually/RB expecting/VBG it/PRP ./.
However/RB ,/, our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/RB ,/, attentive/JJ ,/, helpful/JJ ./.
The/DT kitchen/NN service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ slow/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB terrible/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD not/RB in/IN a/DT hurry/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD fine/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, after/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP our/JJ food/NN ,/, we/PRP went/VBD over/IN and/CC played/VBD a/DT game/NN of/IN pool/NN ./.

We/PRP both/VBP recommend/VB the/DT wings/NNS with/IN the/DT house/NN Flying/VBG Pig/NNP sauce/NN ./.

You/PRP will/MD wait/VB 20/JJ minutes/NNS for/IN a/DT drink/NN refill/NN ./.

We/PRP liked/VBD what/WP they/PRP did/VBD with/IN the/DT decor/NN besides/VBZ the/DT game/NN room/NN .../:
If/IN they/PRP would/MD get/VB someone/NN to/TO put/VB forth/JJ some/DT effort/NN into/IN that/DT menu/NN and/CC put/VBD some/DT less/JJR noisy/NN games/NNS in/IN we/PRP may/MD give/VB it/PRP another/DT try/NN since/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB close/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ house/NN ./.

Do/NNP n't/RB let/VB the/DT outside/JJ appearance/NN of/IN this/DT place/NN tucked/VBD behind/IN a/DT hair/NN salon/NN fool/NN you/PRP ,/, they/PRP are/VBP serving/VBG a/DT very/RB good/JJ menu/NN ,/, service/NN is/VBZ always/RB excellent/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT draft/NN menu/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ combination/NN of/IN local/JJ draft/NN beers/NNS ./.

The/DT only/JJ reason/NN this/DT place/NN has/VBZ 2/VBN stars/NNS is/VBZ because/IN of/IN the/DT patio/NN and/CC cheap/NN drinks/NNS ./.

We/PRP had/VBD to/TO move/NN because/IN the/DT smoke/NN was/VBD so/RB bad/JJ ./.

They/PRP have/VBP to/TO get/VB their/PRP$ arms/NNS around/IN the/DT smoke/NN outside/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

Found/IN it/PRP by/IN looking/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP for/IN places/NNS near/IN our/PRP$ home/NN ./.

We/PRP probably/VBP go/RB here/RB 3/VBN times/NNS a/DT month/NN ./.
Having/VBG a/DT beer/NN menu/NN with/IN details/NNS like/IN origin/NN ,/, alcohol/NN content/NN ,/, and/CC price/NN are/VBP a/DT nice/JJ touch/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB changed/VBN quite/RB a/DT few/JJ times/NNS since/IN they/PRP opened/RB ,/, it/PRP almost/RB feels/NNS like/IN they/PRP change/VBP the/DT menu/NN based/VBN on/IN what/WP was/VBD on/IN sale/NN or/CC what/WP they/PRP can/MD make/VB easily/NNS that/IN day/NN ,/, if/IN they/PRP make/VBP a/DT menu/NN they/PRP need/VBP to/TO stick/JJ to/TO it/PRP a/DT little/RB longer/JJR than/IN a/DT week/NN or/CC two/CD ./.
The/DT draft/NN beer/NN is/VBZ not/RB very/RB cold/JJ and/CC they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO always/RB be/VB out/IN of/IN most/JJS of/IN what/WP is/VBZ on/IN their/PRP$ list/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD assume/VB if/IN you/PRP run/VBP out/IN of/IN something/NN fast/VBP it/PRP must/MD be/VB popular/JJ ,/, stock/NN up/NNS and/CC keep/VB the/DT patrons/NNS happy/NN ./.
The/DT outdoor/NN seating/VBG area/NN is/VBZ odd/JJ ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB inside/NN and/CC request/NN seating/NN and/CC a/DT server/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB seem/VB like/IN there/EX are/VBP sections/NNS as/IN the/DT waitresses/NNS are/VBP waiting/VBG on/IN tables/NNS all/DT over/IN inside/NN and/CC out/NN and/CC you/PRP could/MD be/VB sitting/VBG waiting/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN even/RB though/IN every/DT table/JJ around/IN you/PRP is/VBZ being/VBG served/VBN by/IN different/JJ servers/NNS ./.
Outside/IN ``/`` could/MD be/VB ''/'' great/JJ but/CC they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO be/VB approaching/VBG it/PRP as/IN more/JJR of/IN a/DT problem/NN ,/, when/WRB there/EX are/VBP 4/JJ people/NNS inside/NN and/CC 30/CD outside/IN it/PRP should/MD tell/VB you/PRP something/NN ./.
To/TO sum/VB it/PRP up/IN ;/: make/VB a/DT menu/NN and/CC stick/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, make/VB the/DT outside/NN a/DT priority/NN ,/, create/NNP dedicated/VBD serving/VBG areas/NNS and/CC most/RBS important/JJ figure/NN out/IN why/WRB the/DT beer/NN is/VBZ n't/RB as/RB cold/JJ as/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.

They/PRP put/VBD up/RP a/DT sign/NN Under/IN New/NNP Management/NNP several/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN so/RB stopped/RB in/IN this/DT Saturday/NNP afternoon/NN to/TO see/VB if/IN there/NN were/VBD any/DT changes/NNS ./.
No/DT changes/NN to/TO the/DT interior/NN that/IN I/PRP could/MD tell/VB ,/, the/DT outdoor/NN bar/NN was/VBD not/RB open/JJ and/CC that/IN area/NN still/RB looks/VBZ unkept/JJ like/IN normal/NN ./.
Inside/NN music/NN that/WDT was/VBD playing/VBG was/VBD horrible/JJ and/CC way/NN to/TO loud/VB so/RB conversation/NN was/VBD impossible/JJ ,/, on/IN an/DT afternoon/NN music/JJ should/MD be/VB for/IN background/NN not/RB up/RB in/IN your/PRP$ face/NN ./.
Employees/NNS and/CC managers/NNS talking/VBG back/RB and/CC forth/NN from/IN across/IN the/DT room/NN rather/RB than/IN face/NN to/TO face/NN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD yelling/VBG because/IN music/JJ was/VBD so/RB loud/JJ ./.
Bartenders/NNS very/RB inexperienced/JJ ./.
I/PRP really/VBP hope/JJ things/NNS improve/VBP but/CC my/PRP$ guess/NN is/VBZ they/PRP are/VBP about/IN out/IN of/IN gas/NN ./.
Wo/NNP n't/RB visit/NN again/RB ./.
Sat/NNP at/IN the/DT bar/NN as/IN with/IN most/JJS places/NNS ./.
Taphoiuse/NNP and/CC bartender/NN does/VBZ n't/RB know/VB how/WRB to/TO pour/VB Guiness/NN from/IN draft/NN ./.
Very/NNP small/JJ liquor/NN selection/NN .../: no/DT Seagrams/NNS 7/VBP huh/JJ ?/. !/.
Bar/NNP menu/VBD .../: meaning/VBG limited/VBN selection/NN of/IN food/NN ./.
Fish/JJ tacos/NNS got/VBD 3/NNS but/CC no/DT side/NN like/IN fries/NNS elsewhere/RB ./.
Fish/NNP and/CC chips/VBZ TONS/NNP of/IN fries/NNS ./.
Both/DT meals/NNS were/VBD interesting/JJ .../: flavor/NN was/VBD lacking/VBG ./.
Tasted/VBN like/IN eating/VBG moldy/NN bread/JJ ugh/NN ./.
Customer/NNP beside/NN was/VBD beyond/JJ buzzed/NN and/CC other/JJ bartender/NN gave/VBD another/DT wine/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP give/VBG them/PRP the/DT benefit/NN of/IN the/DT doubt/NN in/IN that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT new/JJ establishment/NN ,/, working/VBG out/IN some/DT kinks/NNS ./.
My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT few/JJ times/NNS ./.
Their/NNP beer/NN selection/NN was/VBD impressive/JJ for/IN such/JJ a/DT small/JJ neighborhood/NN place/NN ./.
One/CD beer/NN I/PRP ordered/VBD came/VBD out/RP flat/JJ ./.
I/PRP told/VBD the/DT waitress/NN who/WP apologized/VBN profusely/RB ,/, brought/VBD me/PRP a/DT different/JJ beer/NN free/NN of/IN charge/NN while/IN they/PRP replaced/VBP the/DT keg/NN on/IN my/PRP$ original/JJ order/NN ./.
She/PRP brought/VBD one/CD out/NN from/IN the/DT new/JJ keg/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Problem/NNP solved/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP got/VBD a/DT free/JJ drink/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ typical/JJ of/IN a/DT bar/NN joint/NN ./.
Sandwiches/NNP ,/, wings/NNS and/CC burgers/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ n't/RB bad/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP enjoyed/VBN their/PRP$ wings/NNS and/CC burgers/NNS .../: however/RB the/DT service/NN has/VBZ been/VBN painfully/RB slow/JJ during/IN times/NNS that/IN there/NNS were/VBD only/RB a/DT few/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT place/NN ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ what/WP the/DT problem/NN in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN is/VBZ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP hopefully/RB that/IN they/PRP will/MD get/VB things/NNS flowing/VBG more/JJR smoothly/RB sooner/JJR than/IN later/JJ ./.
It/PRP would/MD be/VB sad/JJ to/TO see/VB a/DT place/NN with/IN great/JJ potential/JJ fail/NN again/RB in/IN Tega/NNP Cay/NNP !/.
The/DT Patriot/NNP is/VBZ pretty/RB unassuming/JJ from/IN first/JJ look/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT inside/NN is/VBZ big/JJ and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT game/NN room/NN ./.
Their/NNP outside/NNP has/VBZ a/DT bar/NN and/CC a/DT huge/JJ patio-/NN a/DT really/RB nice/JJ space/NN to/TO hang/VB out/RP alone/RB or/CC in/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN any/DT size/NN ./.
The/DT waitresses/NNS were/VBD sweet/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP hope/VBP they/PRP have/VBP more/VBN staff/NN during/IN a/DT busy/NN weekend/NN !/.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT good/JJ selection/NN of/IN draft/NN and/CC bottle/can/JJ beers/NNS (/VBP including/VBG local/JJ NC/NNP and/CC SC/NNP brews/VBZ )/NN ./.
Their/NNP menu/NNP offers/VBZ an/DT average/JJ amount/NN of/IN variety/NN ,/, we/PRP tried/VBD a/DT couple/NN appetizers/NNS ,/, wings/NNS ,/, a/DT sandwich/NN ,/, a/DT burger/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT wrap/NN ./.
The/DT wings/NNS came/VBD out/RP really/RB burnt/NN but/CC the/DT waitress/NN replaced/VBD them/PRP promptly/RB ./.
Everything/NNP else/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good-/JJ definitely/RB bar/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP noticed/VBD on/IN their/PRP$ sign/NN that/IN they/PRP offer/VBP Trivia/NNP on/IN Wednesday/NNP and/CC Music/NNP Trivia/NNP on/IN Thursday/NNP .../:
I/PRP think/VBP if/IN I/PRP were/VBD to/TO return/VB it/PRP would/MD be/VB to/TO hang/VB out/RP ,/, drink/VBP beer/NN on/IN the/DT patio/NN on/IN a/DT warm/NN night/NN ,/, and/CC test/NN my/NNS random/NN knowledge/NN !/.
We/PRP had/VBD their/PRP$ burger/NN ,/, fries/NNS and/CC onion/NN rings/NNS for/IN carry/JJ out/NN ./.
Burgers/NNS were/VBD huge/JJ and/CC tasty/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN looked/VBD very/RB busy/JJ and/CC had/VBD a/DT great/JJ atmosphere/NN for/IN a/DT sports/NNS bar/NN ./.
We/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB it/PRP out/IN inside/outside/NN patio/NN ./.
Like/IN others/NNS ,/, we/PRP live/VBP in/IN Tega/NNP Cay/NNP and/CC are/VBP greatly/RB appreciative/JJ that/IN a/DT new/JJ ``/`` watering/NN hole/NN ''/'' /restaurant/NN has/VBZ opened/VBN up/RB in/IN what/WP really/RB is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ location/NN and/CC facility/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN and/CC money/NN was/VBD put/VBN into/IN updating/VBG the/DT interior/NN from/IN Ziggy/NNP 's/POS to/TO Patriot/NNP ./.
They/PRP took/VBD out/RP a/DT partition/NN wall/NN that/WDT separated/VBN the/DT restaurant/NN from/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, elevated/VBD the/DT booths/NNS around/IN the/DT inside/NN walls/NNS ,/, added/VBD the/DT ``/`` barrel/NN booth/NN ''/'' ,/, etc/NN ./.
We/PRP have/VBP only/RB visited/VBN Patriot/NNP once/RB since/IN it/PRP opened/-NONE- ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP rated/VBN it/PRP four/CD stars/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT potential/NN that/IN is/VBZ there/RB ./.
Given/NNP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT new/JJ establishment/NN ,/, to/TO grade/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT same/JJ criteria/NN I/PRP would/MD as/RB a/DT well-established/JJ restaurant/bar/NN would/MD be/VB unfair/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN they/PRP have/VBP the/DT right/NN structure/NN and/CC business/NN model/NN in/IN place/NN ,/, just/RB need/VBP to/TO work/VB out/RP a/DT few/JJ kinks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP commonly/RB found/VBN with/IN new/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
Pros/NNS :/: -Menu/JJ resembles/NNS that/IN of/IN a/DT ``/`` gastropub/NN ''/'' in/IN many/JJ ways/NNS ,/, with/IN both/DT unique/JJ offerings/NNS (/VBP pork/NN belly/RB sliders/NNS ,/, salt-and-pepper/JJ calamari/NN )/NN and/CC standards/NNS (/VBP burgers/NNS ,/, wings/NNS )/VBP ./.

Cons/NNS (/VBD from/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN )/NN :/: -Server/NN was/VBD initially/RB inattentive/JJ ,/, but/CC came/VBD around/IN more/JJR frequently/NNS and/CC with/IN a/DT better/JJR attitude/NN when/WRB he/PRP could/MD tell/VB I/PRP was/VBD frustrated/VBN ./.
-/JJ ''/'' Patriot/NNP nachos/NNS ''/'' offered/VBD a/DT good/JJ recipe/NN ,/, but/CC lacked/VBD sufficient/JJ amount/NN of/IN toppings/NNS and/CC came/VBD out/RP room/NN temperature/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP given/VBN Patriot/NNP the/DT benefit/NN of/IN the/DT doubt/NN on/IN the/DT ``/`` cons/NNS ''/'' ,/, being/VBG as/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT Sunday/NNP afternoon/NN and/CC they/PRP had/VBD only/RB been/VBN open/JJ for/IN two/CD weeks/NNS ./.
Patriot/NNP shows/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN potential/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP faith/VBN that/IN they/PRP will/MD work/VB out/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT new/JJ restaurant/NN kinks/NNS ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB 2/JJ or/CC 3/CD times/NNS in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS ./.
