Quaint/NNP and/CC charming/VBG and/CC absolutely/RB delicious/JJ Italian/JJ fare/NN ./.
The/DT artichoke/NN appetizer/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ start/NN ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB imagine/VB not/RB liking/VBG anything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP try/VBG a/DT special/JJ and/CC have/VBP not/RB been/VBN disappointed/JJ ./.
With/IN your/PRP$ entree/NN you/PRP get/VB a/DT salad/NN and/CC crusty/NN bread/JJ with/IN dipping/JJ oil/NN and/CC portions/NNS are/VBP generous/JJ ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP hungry/JJ :/: )/.
I/PRP came/VBD to/TO Cafe/NNP Vita/NNP for/IN brunch/NN on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD very/RB excited/JJ to/TO go/VB because/IN their/PRP$ breakfast/NN menu/NN looks/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT lovely/RB atmosphere/RB ,/, cosy/JJ yet/NN classy/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB serve/VB breakfast/NN after/IN noon/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD all/DT made/VBN up/RP our/PRP$ minds/NNS and/CC were/VBD ready/NN to/TO order/NN when/WRB they/PRP finally/RB told/VBD us/PRP that/IN they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB serving/JJ half/DT their/PRP$ menu/NN anymore/RB ./.
Their/NNP menus/NN had/VBD suggested/VBN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP breakfast/lunch/JJ until/IN 2/CD so/IN we/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
Cafe/NNP Vita/NNP gets/VBZ only/RB one/CD star/NN not/RB because/IN of/IN this/DT misunderstanding/NN but/CC because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ service/NN and/CC food/NN quality/NN during/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD waitress/NN for/IN the/DT small/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
She/PRP was/VBD very/RB hard/JJ to/TO flag/NN down/IN after/IN she/PRP forgot/VBD to/TO take/VB our/RP drink/NN orders/NNS and/CC later/JJ refill/NN our/PRP$ drinks/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD a/DT disappointment/NN for/IN half/NN of/IN our/PRP$ large/JJ party/NN ./.
The/DT side/NN salads/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ./.
However/RB the/DT chicken/NN panini/NN was/VBD a/DT miss/NN on/IN flavor/NN and/CC far/RB too/RB bready/JJ ./.
And/CC the/DT cheese/NN ravioli/NN were/VBD over/IN cooked/JJ and/CC grainy/NN ./.
After/IN the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP were/VBD ordering/VBG the/DT chef/NN came/VBD out/RP to/TO apologize/VB that/IN they/PRP were/VBD out/RB of/IN what/WP the/DT table/JJ had/NN ordered/VBN ./.
He/PRP brought/VBD out/IN the/DT alternative/NN ,/, a/DT frozen/NN bag/NN of/IN pasta/NN ./.
Not/RB really/RB the/DT best/JJS etiquette/NN or/CC greatest/NN sales/NNS pitch/NN ./.
(/IN Probably/RB why/VBN my/PRP$ ravioli/NN was/VBD so/RB mushy/JJ ./. )/''
Love/NNP this/DT place/NN !/.
A/DT small/JJ ,/, unique/JJ BYOB/NNP that/IN has/VBZ an/DT Italian/French/NN flair/NN ./.

Liquor/NNP store/NN is/VBZ right/RB down/IN the/DT street/NN if/IN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO grab/VB a/DT bottle/NN of/IN wine/NN ./.
The/DT Oaks/NNP movie/NN theater/NN is/VBZ right/RB next/JJ door/NN for/IN a/DT great/JJ dinner/NN and/CC a/DT movie/NN date/NN night/NN (/NN theater/NN is/VBZ also/RB BYOB/NNP )/NNP ./.
Try/NNP this/DT small/JJ town/NN gem/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB regret/VB it/PRP !/.
This/DT is/VBZ my/RB hometown/VBN coffee/NN shop/NN if/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP able/JJ I/PRP stop/VBP by/IN here/RB for/IN my/PRP$ coffee/NN on/IN the/DT weekend/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT tiny/NN little/JJ joint/JJ located/VBN on/IN Allegheny/NNP River/NNP Blvd/NNP ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ 2/NN and/CC 4/NN top/JJ tables/NNS and/CC some/DT nice/JJ large/JJ chairs/NNS with/IN plenty/NN of/IN magazines/NNS and/CC newspapers/NNS laying/VBG about/IN ./.
The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ always/RB friendly/RB and/CC genuinely/RB interested/JJ in/IN making/NNP you/NNP happy/NN ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB claim/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT gourmet/NN with/IN respect/NN to/TO coffee/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP always/RB found/VBN my/PRP$ medium/NN coffee/NN ,/, hot/NN ,/, dark/NN and/CC tasty/NN with/IN fresh/JJ cream/NN and/CC accompianments/NNS at/IN the/DT plenty/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT selection/NN of/IN pastry/NN and/CC sandwiches/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT reason/NN that/IN inspired/JJ me/NNS to/TO write/VB this/DT review/NN was/VBD this/DT past/NN Sunday/NNP I/PRP stopped/VBP in/IN for/IN some/DT coffee/NN found/VBD myself/NN with/IN some/DT time/NN to/TO kill/NN and/CC decided/VBD to/TO have/VB brunch/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB know/VB they/PRP had/VBD the/DT capability/NN to/TO cook/VB anything/NN on/IN site/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT western/JJ omelette/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ two/CD egg/JJ omelett/NN served/VBN with/IN very/RB high/JJ quality/NN ingredients/NNS (/VBP ham/NN ,/, red/VBD onion/NN ,/, red/VBD pepper/NN ,/, spinach/NN ,/, etc/JJ .../: )/JJ cooked/JJ light/NN and/CC perfectly/RB with/IN the/DT eggs/NNS being/VBG fluffy/NN and/CC airy/NN ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN bacon/NN for/IN the/DT side/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD out/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT guy/JJ offered/NN to/TO ``/`` run/VB next/JJ door/NN ''/'' and/CC buy/VB some/DT for/IN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP settled/VBD on/IN the/DT sausage/NN which/WDT was/VBD okay/NN ,/, not/RB homemade/VB or/CC anything/VB memorable/JJ ./.
There/EX are/VBP not/RB many/JJ other/JJ options/NNS in/IN Oakmont/NNP for/IN coffee/NN or/CC sunday/NN brunch/NN ,/, so/IN you/PRP could/MD do/VB a/DT lot/NN worse/NN than/IN this/DT place/NN for/IN a/DT nice/JJ light/JJ breakfast/NN ./.
A/DT very/JJ cute/NN and/CC under-rated/JJ cafe/NN in/IN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ towns/NNS outside/IN of/IN Pittsburgh/NNP ./.
Oakmont/NNP is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT way/NN between/IN my/PRP$ where/WRB my/JJ parents/NN live/NN and/CC the/DT East/NNP End/NNP where/WRB I/PRP live/VBP ,/, so/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ destination/NN for/IN brunch/NN for/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN and/CC I/PRP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD encouraged/VBN by/IN a/DT friend/NN to/TO try/VB Cafe/NNP Vita/NNP in/IN the/DT small/JJ ,/, unassuming/JJ store/NN front/NN ./.
WOW/NNP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ one/CD bit/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB totally/RB more/RBR impressed/VBN by/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ brunch/NN spots/NNS around/IN the/DT burgh/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP too/RB few/JJ really/RB good/JJ ones/NNS ,/, are/VBP n't/RB there/RB ?/.
I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN several/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ omelets/NNS ,/, of/IN which/WDT the/DT Black/NNP Bean/NNP and/CC Spinach/NNP and/CC Feta/NNP ones/NNS are/VBP my/VBG absolute/RB favorites/NNS ./.
Quality/NN food/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT tastes/NNS considered/VBP ./.
Not/RB the/DT run-of-the-mill/JJ breakfast/NN that/WDT is/VBZ so/RB often/RB found/VBN at/IN Pittsburgh/NNP breakfast/brunch/NN spots/NNS ./.
Plus/NNP they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP a/DT big/JJ hunk/NN of/IN Breadworks/NNS bread/JJ with/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN that/IN is/VBZ such/JJ a/DT delicious/JJ complement/NN ./.
Solid/JJ quality/NN on/IN the/DT coffee/NN as/RB well/RB ,/, with/IN friendly/JJ service/NN ./.
My/NNP mom/NN and/CC friends/NNS were/VBD yapping/VBG away/RB after/IN they/PRP had/VBD closed/VBN ,/, and/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB mind/VB one/CD bit/NN to/TO refill/VB our/PRP$ coffees/NNS and/CC let/VB us/PRP carry/VB on/IN while/IN they/PRP did/VBD their/PRP$ dinner/NN prep/NN and/CC clean-up/JJ ./.
Much/NNP appreciated/VBD ./.
It/PRP never/RB seems/VBZ to/TO fill/VB up/RP the/DT way/NN other/JJ brunch/NN spots/NNS do/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN or/CC otherwise/NN ,/, hence/NN the/DT underrated/JJ description/NN ./.
So/RB go/RB !/.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ dinner/NN menu/NN ,/, and/CC if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ anything/NN like/IN Breakfast/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP in/IN for/IN a/DT tasty/NN meal/NN ./.

The/DT arancini/NN got/VBD a/DT unanimous/JJ thumbs-up/NN from/IN our/PRP$ group/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB much/JJ was/VBD said/VBN about/IN the/DT greens/NNS and/CC beans/NNS ./.
I/PRP personally/RB found/VBD the/DT greens/NNS and/CC beans/NNS to/TO be/VB tasty/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT arancini/NN was/VBD clearly/RB the/DT better/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP their/PRP$ braciole/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN a/DT recommendation/NN from/IN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ group/NN who/WP had/VBD been/VBN here/RB previously/RB ,/, only/RB to/TO learn/NN that/IN they/PRP only/RB had/VBD one/CD serving/NN of/IN braciole/NN ./.
I/PRP should/MD note/VB that/IN our/PRP$ party/NN were/VBD the/DT only/JJ diners/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN while/IN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ./.
I/PRP passed/VBD on/IN the/DT braciole/NN to/TO allow/VB our/PRP$ birthday/NN girl/NN (/NN this/DT was/VBD a/DT birthday/NN celebration/NN )/NN to/TO have/VB it/PRP ./.
Everyone/NNP received/VBD a/DT house/NN salad/NN ,/, and/CC most/RBS chose/JJ to/TO augment/NN it/PRP with/IN gorgonzola/NN cheese/NN ,/, except/IN for/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN who/WP chose/NN feta/NN ./.
The/DT salads/NNS were/VBD good/JJ and/CC not/RB too/RB filling/JJ ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP both/VBP ordered/VBN pumpkin/JJ ravioli/NN in/IN sage/NN brown/NN butter/NN sauce/NN ./.
We/PRP agreed/VBD it/PRP was/VBD tasty/JJ but/CC we/PRP both/DT would/MD have/VB liked/VBN more/JJR butter/NN sauce/NN on/IN our/PRP$ raviolis/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD given/VBN a/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT braciole/NN and/CC would/MD have/VB been/VBN very/RB happy/JJ with/IN that/DT entree/NN ./.

Most/JJS ordered/JJ desert/NN ./.
We/PRP split/VBD an/DT order/NN of/IN their/PRP$ apple/NN Carmel/NNP cake/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
Cafe/NNP Vita/NNP is/VBZ a/DT BYOB/NN with/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT least/JJS expensive/JJ corkage/NN fees/NNS we/PRP have/VBP encountered/VBN ;/: $/$ 5/CD total/NN for/IN our/PRP$ party/NN of/IN 6/CD ,/, with/IN 4/JJ bottles/NNS of/IN wine/NN consumed/VBD ./.
Remarkable/JJ !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD fine/NN ,/, totally/RB unobtrusive/JJ ,/, but/CC water/NN glasses/NNS and/CC bread/JJ baskets/NNS were/VBD refilled/VBN when/WRB needed/JJ without/IN our/PRP$ asking/NN ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP they/PRP can/MD attract/VB enough/JJ business/NN to/TO stay/VB open/JJ ./.
