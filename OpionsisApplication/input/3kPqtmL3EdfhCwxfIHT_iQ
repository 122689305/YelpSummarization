I/PRP would/MD n't/RB even/RB mind/VB just/RB a/DT basic/JJ website/NN with/IN a/DT menu/NN updated/VBD seasonally/RB to/TO reflect/VB any/DT drink/NN specials/NNS ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB twice-/JJ the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT owner/NN was/VBD sitting/VBG out/RP front/JJ talking/VBG to/TO his/PRP$ friends/NNS ./.

He/PRP saw/VBD me/PRP go/VB in/IN and/CC chose/NN not/RB to/TO wait/VB on/IN me/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP just/RB left/VBP ./.

I/PRP paid/VBD $/$ 2/CD for/IN a/DT sadly/JJ small/JJ ,/, terrible/JJ coffee/NN ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP had/VBD gone/NN down/IN the/DT street/NN to/TO the/DT bakery/NN and/CC gotten/VBN their/PRP$ better/NNS and/CC reasonably/RB priced/VBN coffee/NN instead/RB ./.
Swear/JJ some/DT people/NNS writing/VBG reviews/NNS here/RB must/MD have/VB never/RB been/VBN to/TO a/DT legit/NN coffee/NN shop/NN in/IN their/PRP$ life/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ terrible/JJ coffee/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ way/NN overpriced/VBN ./.
A/DT latte/NN at/IN Starbucks/NNP costs/NNP less/JJR and/CC tastes/VBZ 10x/CD better/NN ./.
I/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN here/NN since/IN I/PRP just/RB moved/VBD to/TO the/DT neighborhood/NN and/CC thought/VB it/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN meh/NN ./.
The/DT coffee/NN was/VBD bland/JJ and/CC the/DT entire/JJ joint/JJ felt/NN pretty/RB dated/VBD (/NNP could/MD appeal/VB to/TO some/DT people/NNS I/PRP suppose/VBP ./. )/''

No/DT vegan/NN options/NNS either/NN ./.
Overall/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD worth/VBN the/DT $/$ 4.75/CD for/IN a/DT latte/NN when/WRB I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN way/NN better/NNS lattes/NNS from/IN places/NNS like/IN Espresso/NNP A/DT Mano/NNP in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.

We/PRP made/VBD the/DT mistake/NN of/IN ordering/VBG 2/CD instead/NN of/IN sharing/VBG one/CD ./.
We/PRP took/VBD our/PRP$ coffees/NNS to/TO go/VB and/CC paid/VB more/JJR than/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB expected/VBN ./.

We/PRP realized/VBD before/IN that/IN the/DT owner/NN (/IN he/PRP also/RB owns/VBZ the/DT ice/NN cream/NN shop/NN two/CD doors/NNS down/IN )/NN was/VBD incredibly/RB grumpy/JJ when/WRB we/PRP stopped/VBP in/IN to/TO get/VB a/DT scoop/NN last/JJ summer/NN ./.
We/PRP tried/VBD to/TO write/VB it/PRP off/IN because/IN maybe/NN he/PRP was/VBD just/RB having/VBG a/DT bad/JJ day/NN .../:
But/CC just/RB this/DT morning/NN ,/, we/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN and/CC my/PRP$ fiancé/NN ordered/IN two/CD drinks/NNS while/IN I/PRP waited/VBD outside/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ puppies/NNS ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD on/IN his/PRP$ cell/NN phone/NN the/DT ENTIRE/NNP time/NN she/PRP ordered/VBD ./.
She/PRP almost/RB could/MD n't/RB order/VB the/DT second/JJ drink/NN because/IN he/PRP would/MD n't/RB even/RB look/VB over/IN at/IN her/PRP ./.
The/DT ONLY/NNP thing/NN he/PRP said/VBD was/VBD ``/`` CASH/NNP ONLY/NNP ''/'' (/NN and/CC he/PRP pointed/VBD at/IN his/PRP$ ATM/NNP )/NNP when/WRB she/PRP tried/VBD handing/NN over/IN her/PRP debit/JJ card/NN ./.
Still/RB on/IN his/PRP$ phone/NN ,/, he/PRP exited/VBD the/DT store/NN and/CC stood/NN on/IN the/DT stoop/NN before/IN my/PRP$ fiancé/NN walked/VBD out/RP ./.
We/PRP will/MD NOT/VB return/NN to/TO this/DT coffee/NN shop/NN ./.
We/PRP would/MD much/RB rather/RB take/VB our/NN business/NN to/TO the/DT MUCH/NNP friendlier/NN Café/NNP Cravings/NNP by/IN Chatham/NNP Village/NNP ./.
The/DT environment/NN there/RB is/VBZ much/RB more/JJR like/IN a/DT community/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP 're/VBP greeted/VBN with/IN a/DT smile/NN by/IN the/DT owner/NN when/WRB you/PRP walk/VBP in/IN --/: that/IN 's/VBZ how/WRB a/DT coffee/NN shop/NN should/MD be/VB ./.

The/DT area/NN behind/IN the/DT counter/NN is/VBZ filthy/JJ and/CC the/DT coffee/NN is/VBZ mediocre/NN at/IN best/JJS ./.
Yuck/NNP ./.
Stopped/VBN by/IN for/IN a/DT coffee/NN and/CC I/PRP felt/VBP as/IN if/IN I/PRP was/VBD intruding/VBG even/RB though/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD empty/NN ./.
Not/RB one/CD word/NN was/VBD uttered/VBN by/IN the/DT proprietor/NN and/CC was/VBD totally/RB unfriendly/RB ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP you/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT local/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT hi/NN ./.
Coffee/NN was/VBD mediocre/JJ at/IN best/JJS ./.
In/IN my/PRP$ quest/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJS chai/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN ,/, I/PRP stopped/VBD into/IN my/PRP$ little/JJ neighborhood/NN coffee/NN shop/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN talked/VBD me/PRP into/IN ordering/VBG a/DT frozen/NN ``/`` frappuccino/NN ''/'' blended/VBD drink/NN ./.

But/CC .../: I/PRP caved/VBD ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP weak/JJ !/.
I/PRP CAN/VBP tell/JJ you/PRP though/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD really/RB delicious/JJ !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO make/VB a/DT chai/NN drink/NN blended/VBD because/IN they/PRP usually/RB ends/VBZ up/RP tasting/VBG like/IN water/NN flavored/VBN chai/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP he/PRP did/VBD but/CC the/DT consistency/NN was/VBD great/JJ !/.
Plus/NNP he/PRP told/VBD me/PRP he/PRP mixes/VBZ in/IN a/DT little/JJ vanilla/NN and/CC caramel/NN syrup/NN plus/VBZ a/DT touch/NN of/IN cinnamon/NN ./.

Rude/NNP service/NN ,/, awful/JJ coffee/NN ,/, overpriced/VBN ,/, and/CC cash/NN only/RB ./.
The/DT service/NN and/CC ownership/NN it/PRP was/VBD makes/VBN this/DT place/NN so/RB horrific/JJ ./.
Beyond/NNP rude/NN and/CC inconsiderate/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ even/RB in/IN existence/NN is/VBZ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT incline/NN ./.
DO/NNP NOT/NNP WASTE/NNP YOUR/NNP TIME/NNP OR/NNP MONEY/NNP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP supporting/VBG small/JJ business/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB one/CD I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB giving/NNP your/NNP money/NN to/TO ./.

I/PRP had/VBD to/TO step/VB around/IN him/PRP to/TO get/VB in/IN the/DT door/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN i/NN noticed/VBD when/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN was/VBD how/WRB dirty/JJ the/DT floor/NN was/VBD ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN swept/mopped/VBN in/IN a/DT month/NN ./.

A/DT small/JJ little/NN coffee/NN shop/NN ,/, nothing/NN special/NN as/IN far/JJ as/IN coffee/NN shops/NNS go/VBP ./.
If/IN you/PRP come/VBP in/IN expecting/VBG comfy/NN chairs/NNS and/CC a/DT quiet/JJ please/NN to/TO study/NN or/CC read/NN ,/, move/NN on/IN ./.
