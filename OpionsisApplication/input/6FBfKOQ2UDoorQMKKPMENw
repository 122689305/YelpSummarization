My/NNP first/JJ visit/NN was/VBD part/NN of/IN a/DT large/JJ group/NN that/WDT shared/VBD various/JJ dishes/NNS so/IN we/PRP had/VBD good/JJ coverage/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
A/DT tiny/NN kitchen/NN ,/, cooking/VBG area/NN and/CC fridge/NN seem/NN to/TO limit/VB the/DT dishes/NNS ./.
I/PRP will/MD say/VB that/IN everything/NN had/VBD great/JJ flavour/JJ -/JJ often/RB accentuated/VBN with/IN too/RB much/JJ salt/NN or/CC garlic/NN but/CC nothing/NN went/VBD to/TO waste/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN food/NN alone/NN I/PRP 'd/MD rate/VB 3-star/JJ but/CC minus/RB one/CD star/NN for/IN the/DT value/NN ./.
Much/NNP like/IN the/DT 275ml/CD bottles/NNS of/IN Duggan/NNP 's/POS number/NN 9/NN sold/VBD at/IN full/JJ size/NN beer/NN prices/NNS the/DT plate/NN of/IN ravioli/NN is/VBZ $/$ 10/CD for/IN 10/CD tiny/NN raviolis/NNS ./.
Other/JJ dishes/NNS were/VBD the/DT size/NN of/IN half/DT appetizers/NNS at/IN most/JJS restaurants/NNS but/CC similar/JJ prices/NNS ./.
Wine/NNP list/NNP is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ pricey/NN too/RB for/IN wine/NN that/IN was/VBD served/VBN room/NN temperature/NN -/JJ one/CD bottle/NN had/VBD gone/NN bad/NNS and/CC was/VBD quickly/RB replaced/VBN (/NN on/IN the/DT house/NN )/NN ./.
Certainly/RB low/JJ in/IN the/DT value/NN category/NN for/IN a/DT low/JJ rent/JJ area/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ Dundas/NNP West/NNP and/CC Lansdowne/NNP after/IN all/DT ./.
Sounds/NNS like/IN the/DT chef/NN is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN more/JJR and/CC could/MD do/VB more/RBR by/IN serving/VBG more/JJR ./.
Wow/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
And/CC so/RB is/VBZ the/DT service/NN ./.
You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB find/VB many/JJ restaurants/NNS offering/VBG $/$ 3/CD appetizers/NNS AND/RB have/VBP top-notch/JJ service/NN ./.
Try/NNP the/DT ceviche/NN !/.
Went/NNP here/RB on/IN Wednesday/NNP night/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ really/RB fun/JJ ./.
Three/NNP sections/NNS -/JJ things/NNS beginning/VBG in/IN A/DT at/IN $/$ 5/CD ,/, things/NNS beginning/VBP in/IN B/NNP (/NNP such/JJ as/IN Bivalves/NNS )/VBP for/IN $/$ 8/CD ,/, and/CC things/NNS beginning/NN in/IN C/NNP for/IN $/$ 13/CD ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RB having/VBG some/DT nice/JJ cured/JJ trout/NN ,/, oysters/NNS ,/, red/VBD slaw/NN with/IN feta/NN ,/, a/DT wonderful/JJ seafood/NN soup/NN ,/, and/CC some/DT snails/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB the/DT snails/NNS were/VBD not/RB really/RB worth/VB the/DT time/NN and/CC effort/NN -/NN mostly/RB the/DT effort/NN ,/, as/IN they/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB much/JJ unattainable/JJ despite/NN much/JJ poking/NN and/CC prodding/NN and/CC fishing/NN with/IN toothpicks/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT other/JJ dishes/NNS were/VBD well/RB prepared/VBN in/IN a/DT country/rustic/JJ style/NN with/IN good/JJ flavours/NNS ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ old/JJ school/NN diner/NN with/IN a/DT dark-lit/JJ warmth/NN ./.
It/PRP worked/VBD well/RB ./.
Fun/NNP and/CC playfulness/NN with/IN food/NN was/VBD the/DT theme/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP worked/-NONE- ./.
(/RB except/IN the/DT darn/JJ snails/NNS )/.
We/PRP booked/VBD a/DT month/NN in/IN advance/NN with/IN the/DT intention/NN of/IN eating/VBG crickets/NNS ./.
Great/NNP idea/NNP !/.
The/DT taste/NN menu/NN for/IN that/DT evening/NN included/VBD a/DT salad/JJ ,/, soup/RB ,/, crickets/NNS pan/VBP fried/VBN ,/, crickets/NNS on/IN french/JJ pizza/NN and/CC trout/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD never/RB had/VBD a/DT food/NN tasting/VBG experience/NN of/IN this/DT nature/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ ingredients/NNS cooked/VBD were/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC seasonal/JJ ./.
Therefore/NNP ,/, the/DT good/JJ quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD ideal/JJ for/IN negating/VBG the/DT effects/NNS of/IN disturbingly/RB cold/JJ temperature/NN outside/NN ./.
The/DT pan/JJ fried/JJ crickets/NNS tasted/VBN like/IN bacon/NN but/CC far/RB more/RBR nourishing/JJ ./.
Never/NNP thought/VBD I/PRP would/MD enjoy/VB eating/JJ insects/NNS that/IN much/JJ ./.
Initially/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD more/JJR of/IN a/DT fear/NN factor/NN adventure/NN but/CC after/IN the/DT first/JJ cricket/NN touched/VBD my/PRP$ tongue/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD in/IN a/DT new/JJ paradigm/NN of/IN cuisine/NN ./.
Everyone/NNP else/RB I/PRP was/VBD with/IN shared/VBD the/DT similar/JJ view/NN ./.
The/DT wine/NN menu/NN is/VBZ there/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB drink/VB so/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ or/CC not/RB ./.
Instead/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD home-made/JJ ginger/JJ beer/NN ,/, another/DT good/JJ idea/NN ./.
The/DT chef/NN was/VBD gracious/JJ enough/JJ to/TO answer/VB questions/NNS about/IN what/WP else/NN could/MD be/VB cooked/VBN and/CC gave/VBD me/PRP ``/`` the/DT bible/JJ ''/'' on/IN the/DT edible/JJ insects/NNS of/IN the/DT earth/NN ./.
Eating/VBG lower/JJR on/IN the/DT food/NN chain/NN is/VBZ possible/JJ and/CC it/PRP can/MD be/VB very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
The/DT experience/NN is/VBZ for/IN sure/JJ unique/JJ because/IN there/EX is/VBZ ``/`` No/DT Menu/NNP ''/'' ,/, just/RB be/VB sure/JJ that/IN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG for/IN crickets/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ always/RB nice/JJ to/TO let/VB Nathan/NNP (/IN the/DT chef/NN )/NN know/NN ./.
My/NNP favourite/JJ new/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
Highly/RB recommended/VBD ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ very/RB reasonably/RB priced/VBN with/IN lots/NNS of/IN options/NNS changing/VBG every/DT night/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ locally/RB sourced/VBN and/CC the/DT combinations/NNS are/VBP always/RB unique/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ usually/RB something/NN mind-blowing/JJ every/DT night/NN that/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ ends/NNS up/RP ordering/VBG a/DT second/JJ round/NN of/IN ./.
The/DT lighting/NN is/VBZ perfect/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT vibe/NN feels/NNS casual/JJ but/CC unique/JJ ./.
Great/NNP wine/NN and/CC cocktail/NN list/NN also/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB hungry/JJ (/NN but/CC ,/, you/PRP should/MD probably/RB at/IN least/JJS try/NNS that/IN night/NN 's/POS dips/NNS or/CC breads/NNS ,/, for/IN $/$ 3/CD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ trying/VBG )/NNS ./.
I/PRP still/RB have/VBP n't/RB built/VBN up/RP the/DT courage/NN to/TO try/VB the/DT crickets/NNS ./.
Atlantic/NNP is/VBZ a/DT place/NN I/PRP can/MD return/VB to/TO again/RB and/CC again/RB ./.
And/CC I/PRP have/VBP ./.
Casual/NNP friendly/RB knowledgable/JJ service/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ thoughtful/JJ enough/NN to/TO be/VB interesting/JJ but/CC does/VBZ n't/RB cross/VB into/IN the/DT overly/JJ experimental/NN ./.
Simplicity/NNP works/NNP here/RB ./.
Sharing/VBG dishes/NNS allows/VBZ for/IN many/JJ flavours/NNS and/CC adds/VBZ to/TO the/DT experience/NN that/IN I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP intend/VBP ./.
Unpretentious/JJ but/CC refined/VBN ./.
Nathan/NNP Isberg/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB need/VB my/PRP$ help/NN ./.
If/IN he/PRP can/MD stick/VB with/IN it/PRP ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ on/IN track/NN to/TO singlehandedly/JJ revolutionize/NN dining/VBG out/NN ./.

We/PRP had/VBD an/DT extraordinary/JJ meal/NN -/JJ 4/NN of/IN the/DT best/JJS dishes/NNS I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN out/RP in/IN an/DT eating/JJ place/NN (/IN I/PRP think/VBP Nathan/NNP is/VBZ pushing/VBG away/RB from/IN the/DT word/NN ``/`` restaurant/NN ''/'' )/NN ./.
And/CC ,/, the/DT beauty/NN of/IN not/RB having/VBG to/TO choose/NN is/VBZ a/DT delight/NN ./.
Just/NNP let/VBD it/PRP come/-NONE- ,/, whatever/VB it/PRP might/MD be/VB ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, the/DT lighting/NN is/VBZ low/JJ ,/, but/CC once/RB you/PRP remember/VBP that/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO read/VB or/CC choose/VB ,/, who/WP needs/-NONE- reading/VBP level/NN light/JJ anyway/NN ?/.
If/IN its/PRP$ label/NN as/IN a/DT ``/`` fish/JJ ''/'' place/NN puts/VBZ you/PRP off/RP ,/, fear/NN not/RB ./.
-/JJ The/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD almost/RB vegetarian/JJ ./.
Each/DT was/VBD a/DT cacophony/NN of/IN oddball/JJ but/CC delightful/JJ flavours/NNS ./.
THIS/NNP is/VBZ what/VBG a/DT professional/JJ cook/NN can/MD do/VB better/JJR than/IN a/DT home/NN cook/NN -/JJ surprise/NN and/CC delight/NN with/IN little/JJ additions/NNS ,/, dashes/NNS and/CC tweaks/NNS ./.
Funny/NNP though/NNP ,/, while/IN his/PRP$ new/JJ No/NN Choice/NNP ,/, No/NNP Prices/NNPS formula/NNP relieves/VBZ diners/NNS of/IN the/DT anxiety/NN of/IN Choice/NNP at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN ,/, it/PRP rolls/VBZ that/IN anxiety/NN over/IN to/TO end/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT Settling/NNP Up/NNP moment/NN ./.
We/PRP 've/VBP all/DT stressed/VBN over/IN the/DT appropriate/NN tip/NN amount/NN -/JJ 15/CD %/NN ,/, 18/CD ,/, 20/CD ,/, on/IN the/DT pretax/NN or/CC after/IN tax/NN total/NN ?/.

Here/NNP we/PRP are/VBP 5/VBN days/NNS later/JJ and/CC I/PRP am/VBP still/RB wondering/VBG what/WP the/DT right/NN amount/NN to/TO leave/NN is/VBZ ./.
Great/NNP restaurant/VBD ,/, excellent/JJ service/NN ,/, no/DT menu/NN concept/NN is/VBZ brilliant/JJ ./.
Last/JJ night/NN 's/POS dinner/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC healthy/JJ with/IN unique/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ flavours/NNS ./.

It/PRP certainly/RB gives/VBZ one/CD a/DT new/JJ and/CC positive/JJ appreciation/NN for/IN dining/JJ out/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD lucky/JJ enough/JJ to/TO attend/VB 2/CD special/JJ vegan/JJ tasting/VBG menu/NN dinners/NNS at/IN Nathan/NNP Isberg/NNP 's/POS new/JJ restaurant/NN Atlantic/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD sum/VB the/DT experience/NN up/IN in/IN two/CD words/NNS :/: corn/JJ smut/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP usually/RB fall/VBN into/IN the/DT mushroom/NN despising/VBG spectrum/NN but/CC the/DT huitlacoche/NN vegan/NN risotto/NN with/IN shaved/JJ asparagus/NNS and/CC bread/JJ crumbs/NNS at/IN the/DT first/JJ dinner/NN was/VBD really/RB an/DT amazing/JJ dish/NN ./.
For/IN dessert/NN the/DT fried/VBN figs/NNS in/IN coconut/NN milk/NN and/CC maple/NN syrup/NN was/VBD a/DT resounding/NN hit/NN ./.
The/DT cocoa/NN ,/, grapefruit/NN and/CC lavender/NN risotto/NN dessert/NN served/VBD at/IN the/DT second/JJ tasting/VBG menu/NN was/VBD less/JJR enjoyed/JJ (/NNS one/CD person/NN described/VBD it/PRP as/IN 'soapy/JJ '/NN )/NNS but/CC points/NNS for/IN creativity/NN were/VBD awarded/RB ./.
Wednesday/NNP nights/VBZ they/PRP spin/VBP vinyl/NN and/CC turn/NN into/IN a/DT watering/JJ hole/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP this/DT cozy/NN spot/NN and/CC appreciate/VB their/PRP$ effort/NN to/TO serve/VB food/NN that/IN is/VBZ lower/JJR on/IN the/DT food/NN chain/NN (/VBD think/RB crickets/NNS )/RB ./.
Especially/RB in/IN a/DT city/NN that/WDT seems/-NONE- to/TO have/VB gone/NN all/DT retarded/VBN gaga/NN for/IN pork/NN products/NNS ./.

A/DT salad/JJ of/IN flowers/NNS and/CC nuts/NNS is/VBZ wonderfully/RB unique/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ./.

The/DT chef/NN plays/VBZ the/DT role/NN of/IN conduit/NN more/RBR so/RB than/IN creator/NN ./.
Mother/RB Nature/NN is/VBZ never/RB upstaged/JJ ./.
Each/DT dish/JJ is/VBZ homage/NN ./.
Even/RB our/VBD waitress/NN projected/VBD the/DT same/JJ vibe/NN ./.
Like/IN everything/NN else/NN at/IN the/DT Atlantic/NNP ,/, she/PRP was/VBD delightful/JJ and/CC beautiful/JJ in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT suggested/NNP humility/NN ,/, honesty/NN and/CC a/DT kind/NN of/IN centeredness/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP Buddha/NNP and/CC Christ/NNP would/MD really/RB enjoy/VB sharing/VBG a/DT meal/NN here/RB ./.
Thank/NNP you/PRP ,/, Yelpers/NNS ,/, for/IN guiding/NN us/NN here/RB ./.
Very/NNP interesting/NNP menu/NN ,/, good/JJ tasting/NN food/NN ,/, but/CC poor/JJ service/NN and/CC shabby/NN decor/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ run/VBN by/IN a/DT chef/NN who/WP is/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN sustainable/JJ food/NN choices/NNS (/VBP hence/NN the/DT crickets/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD see/VB how/WRB his/PRP$ ingredients/NNS can/MD turn/VB some/DT people/NNS off/VBP but/CC if/IN you/PRP have/VBP an/DT open/JJ mind/NN about/IN food/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP this/DT place/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT very/RB enjoyable/JJ experience/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP came/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT Wed/NNP night/NN ,/, we/PRP ended/VBD up/RP just/RB getting/VBG a/DT fixed/NN tasting/VBG menu/NN for/IN $/$ 70/CD (/-NONE- for/IN 2/CD people/NNS plus/RB drinks/VBZ )/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD enough/JJ food/NN to/TO feed/VB us/PRP both/DT but/CC I/PRP could/MD have/VB probably/RB eaten/VBN more/JJR if/IN given/VBN the/DT option/NN ./.
The/DT portions/NNS are/VBP small/JJ so/RB rethink/VB this/DT option/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT traditionally/RB large/JJ meal/NN ./.
Everything/IN we/PRP had/VBD was/VBD good/JJ (/NN summer/NN gazpacho/NN ,/, quinoa/RB salad/RB ,/, ash/JJ gnudi/NN with/IN beet/NN greens/NNS ,/, smoked/VBD trout/NN with/IN potatoes/NNS ,/, and/CC chorizo/NN ``/`` paella/NN ''/'' made/VBD with/IN barley/farro/NN and/CC served/VBN with/IN 2/CD roasted/VBN quails/NNS )/RB ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT gnudi/NN was/VBD our/VBN favorite/JJ dish/JJ (/NN see/VB pics/NNS )/VBP -/JJ perfect/NN texture/NN ,/, taste/NN ,/, excellent/JJ sauce/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT paella/NN was/VBD my/VBN least/NN favorite/JJ dish/JJ because/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB ,/, very/RB dry/JJ and/CC chewy/NN and/CC I/PRP just/RB prefer/VBP traditional/JJ rice/NN in/IN this/DT dish/NN ./.
The/DT birds/NNS were/VBD good/JJ though/NN ./.
The/DT tobacco/NN crème/NN brulee/NN they/PRP usually/RB have/VBP on/IN the/DT menu/NN did/VBD n't/RB set/VB properly/RB that/IN night-/JJ the/DT waitress/NN apologized/VBD on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT chef/NN and/CC offered/VBD us/PRP to/TO taste/VB it/PRP before/IN committing/VBG .../: the/DT taste/NN was/VBD great/JJ so/IN we/PRP kept/VBP it/PRP ;/: just/RB a/DT very/RB runny/JJ texture/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB did/VBD n't/RB taste/VB any/DT tobacco/NN but/CC maybe/VB the/DT whole/JJ dish/NN was/VBD off/RP that/IN night/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD lacking/VBG because/IN our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD brand/JJ new/JJ and/CC did/VBD n't/RB have/VB any/DT help/NN ./.
Drinks/NNP took/VBD forever/NN ,/, we/PRP never/RB got/VBD water/NN refills/NNS ,/, and/CC she/PRP unfortunately/RB had/VBD no/DT knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN or/CC the/DT chef/NN 's/POS concept/NN ./.
I/PRP give/VBP them/PRP a/DT break/NN on/IN this/DT one/CD though/NN because/IN they/PRP were/VBD actually/RB holding/VBG a/DT private/JJ function/NN in/IN the/DT back/NN that/IN night/NN and/CC were/VBD n't/RB going/VBG to/TO open/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

Not/RB a/DT bad/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT casual/JJ night/NN but/CC not/RB somewhere/RB you/PRP want/VBP to/TO hold/VB a/DT birthday/other/NN celebration/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Overall/IN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP the/DT food/NN made/VBD up/RP for/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN attentive/JJ service/NN ./.
The/DT chef/NN 's/POS creativity/NN would/MD have/VB me/PRP coming/VBG back/RB at/IN least/JJS once/RB more/RBR ./.

Atlantic/NNP ,/, formerly/RB a/DT family-owned/JJ Portuguese/NN restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT up/NN and/CC coming/VBG Ossington/NNP foodies/NNS area/RB ,/, is/VBZ now/RB home/NN to/TO Chef/NNP Nathan/NNP Isberg/NNP ./.

Using/IN produce/NN ,/, low-fat/high/JJ protein/NN meats/NNS and/CC keeping/NNS in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT area/NN 's/POS Portuguese/JJ feel/NN ;/: the/DT Atlantic/NNP features/VBZ an/DT array/NN of/IN fusion/NN tapas-style/NN dishes/VBZ that/IN will/MD keep/VB you/PRP fascinated/VBD with/IN its/PRP$ unique/JJ use/NN of/IN ingredients/NNS ./.
With/IN a/DT similar/JJ fusion/NN style/NN thematic/JJ as/IN Chef/NNP Susur/NNP Lee/NNP 's/POS Lee/NNP on/IN King/NNP Street/NNP ,/, Atlantic/NNP 's/POS Isberg/NNP offers/VBZ a/DT daily/JJ menu/NN of/IN 10-12/JJ unique/JJ dishes/NNS inspired/VBD by/IN European/Mediterranean/NNP staples/NNS ./.
At/IN any/DT given/JJ day/NN ,/, you/PRP might/MD find/VB anything/NN from/IN Escargots/NNS to/TO Risotto/NNP ,/, Sardines/NNP and/CC even/RB Crickets/NNS ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP this/DT is/VBZ what/WP Isberg/NNP meant/NN by/IN low-fat/high/JJ protein/NN meals/NNS ./.
Although/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB get/VB the/DT pleasure/NN of/IN being/VBG offered/VBN the/DT crickets/NNS ,/, we/PRP did/VBD decide/VB on/IN a/DT very/RB unique/JJ blend/NN of/IN its/PRP$ most/JJS popular/JJ items/NNS ./.
On/IN a/DT cold/NN winter/NN day/NN ,/, soup/RB seems/VBZ like/IN a/DT no-brainier/JJ to/TO kick-off/NN a/DT meal/NN ;/: Atlantic/NNP 's/POS Littleneck/NNP Clam/NNP and/CC Lobster/NNP Chowder/NNP did/VBD the/DT trick/NN ./.
Notes/NNS of/IN garlic/NN ,/, cream/NN and/CC paprika/NN were/VBD present/JJ throughout/JJ this/DT dish/NN ./.
The/DT dish/NN is/VBZ called/VBN Littleneck/NNP as/IN it/PRP refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT clams/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT shellfish/JJ hierarchy/NN ,/, littlenecks/NNS are/VBP the/DT second/JJ smallest/NN version/NN of/IN clams/NNS ./.

Following/VBG the/DT fishy/JJ route/NN ,/, we/PRP also/RB decided/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT Trout/NNP Gravlax/NNP &/CC Wakame/NNP Salad/NNP ./.
Gravlax/NNP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT ingredient/JJ but/CC rather/RB a/DT way/NN of/IN serving/VBG fish/JJ ./.
Gravlax/NNP is/VBZ the/DT style/NN of/IN curing/VBG salmon/NN or/CC trout/NN that/IN has/VBZ been/VBN cold/JJ smoked/NN ./.
It/PRP almost/RB tastes/VBZ like/IN sashimi/NN or/CC smoked/JJ salmon/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP rather/RB say/VBP its/PRP$ a/DT marriage/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD ;/: I/PRP just/RB hope/VBP they/PRP never/RB get/VBP a/DT divorce/NN ./.
To/TO keep/VB Wikipedia/NNP alive/JJ ,/, for/IN those/DT of/IN you/PRP that/IN do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, Wakame/NNP salad/NN is/VBZ simply/RB a/DT seaweed/VBN salad/JJ sprinkled/VBN with/IN sesame/JJ seeds/NNS ,/, japanese/RB style/JJ ./.

Tartiflette/NNP at/IN Atlantic/NNP is/VBZ a/DT potatoes/NNS ,/, leek/NN and/CC cave-aged/JJ Gruyere/NNP cheese/NN potato/NN gratin/NN infused/VBN with/IN Riesling/NNP ./.
The/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT Isberg/NNP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO elevate/VB the/DT quality/NN and/CC tastiness/NN of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS is/VBZ what/WP took/VBD us/PRP to/TO heaven/VB once/RB we/PRP tasted/VBD this/DT dish/NN ./.
Cave-aged/JJ Gruyere/NNP is/VBZ a/DT matured/JJ 1-year-old/JJ Swiss/NN cheese/NN ,/, secluded/VBD in/IN the/DT caves/NNS of/IN kaltbach/NN in/IN Switzerland/NNP ./.
The/DT tartiflette/NN infused/VBD with/IN the/DT Riesling/NNP ,/, a/DT german/JJ aromatic/JJ grape/NN ,/, made/VBD all/DT the/DT falvours/NNS come/VBP to/TO life/NN ./.

The/DT name/NN ``/`` green/JJ ''/'' comes/NN from/IN its/PRP$ youthfulness/NN more/RBR so/RB than/IN its/PRP$ colour/NN ./.
In/IN whites/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ borderline/NN like/IN a/DT sparkling/NN wine/NN with/IN a/DT fruity/NN and/CC acidic/JJ taste/NN ;/: while/IN in/IN reds/NNS the/DT grapes/NNS used/VBD are/VBP deep/JJ red/VBN and/CC tannic/JJ ./.
Being/VBG that/IN most/JJS dishes/NNS at/IN Atlantic/JJ skip/NN on/IN the/DT meat/NN and/CC charcuterie/NN ,/, this/DT wine/NN seems/VBZ like/IN an/DT obvious/JJ choice/NN for/IN your/PRP$ tapas-style/JJ meal/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD highly/RB recommend/VB pairing/VBG your/PRP$ meal/NN with/IN it/PRP ./.
Note/NN to/TO reader/NN :/: Atlantic/NNP 's/POS risotto/NN or/CC orzotto/NN style/NN dishes/VBZ tend/NN to/TO be/VB extremely/RB salty/JJ following/VBG the/DT Chef/NNP 's/POS preference/NN ./.

The/DT dishes/NNS :/: Red/JJ cabbage/NN and/CC .../: something/NN else/RB salad/JJ with/IN plum/NN umami/NN dressing/NN and/CC black/NN walnuts/NNS ./.

Onion/NNP tarte/NN with/IN gruyere/JJ cheese/NN on/IN top/JJ (/NN which/WDT I/PRP peeled/VBD off/RP )/NNS ./.

A/DT plate/NN of/IN grilled/JJ bread/NN ,/, a/DT GIGANTIC/NNP hunk/NN of/IN cheese/NN (/NN not/RB sure/JJ what/WP kind/NN )/NN and/CC spicy/NN olives/NNS ./.

Jerk/NNP black/NN cod/NN on/IN rapini/NN ,/, fregola/NN pasta/NN ,/, soupy/JJ sauce/NN and/CC an/DT egg/NN cooked/VBD sous-vide/JJ ./.

This/DT was/VBD a/DT really/RB great/JJ experience/NN .../: fine/NN dining/NN in/IN a/DT casual/JJ atmosphere/NN with/IN a/DT really/RB great/JJ server/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ pricey/NN (/VBD $/$ 35/CD per/CD person/NN )/NN but/CC we/PRP figured/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD an/DT experience/NN we/PRP 'd/MD never/RB had/VBD before/RB and/CC the/DT quality/NN was/VBD really/RB quite/JJ good/JJ ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP that/IN the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ bigger/NN ./.
We/PRP all/VBP came/VBD out/RP just/RB a/DT little/RB less/JJR than/IN full/JJ ,/, which/WDT I/PRP guess/VBZ is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN considering/VBG this/DT was/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT holiday/NN season/NN ./.
They/PRP take/VBP debit/NN ,/, not/RB credit/RB cards/NNS ./.
BOTTOM/NNP LINE/NNP :/: A/DT solid/JJ seafood/NN oriented/VBN restaurant/NN with/IN some/DT creative/JJ dishes/NNS (/VBP the/DT wild/NN salmon/NN tartare/NN is/VBZ a/DT MUST/NNP order/NN !/.

I/PRP 'll/VBP come/VBN back/RB in/IN a/DT few/JJ months/NNS to/TO see/VB how/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB in/IN any/DT particular/JJ rush/NN ./.
Cost/NN :/: -Appetizers/NNS $/$ 4-9/CD ,/, and/CC mains/VBZ $/$ 8-14/CD ./.
Atmosphere/Decor/NNP :/: -As/NNP another/DT reviewer/NN put/IN it/PRP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN a/DT dimly/JJ lit/NN fisherman/NN 's/POS shack/NN canvassed/VBN with/IN massive/JJ harbour/NN photos/NNS and/CC accompanied/VBN with/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN seating/VBG arrangements/NNS from/IN small/JJ tables/NNS for/IN two/CD ,/, to/TO a/DT booth/NN for/IN four/CD ,/, to/TO a/DT bench/NN for/IN six/CD ./.
-The/JJ aesthetics/NNS works/RB well/RB ,/, but/CC is/VBZ cheapened/VBN by/IN the/DT bland/NN tiled/VBD floor/NN and/CC really/RB garish/JJ walk-in/NN mat/rug/NN ./.
-Your/JJ favourite/JJ indie/NN rock/NN bands/NNS playing/NN in/IN the/DT background/NN at/IN ,/, perhaps/RB ,/, just/RB a/DT touch/NN too/RB loudly/RB ./.
Ordered/NNP :/: -The/JJ menu/NN rotates/VBZ frequently/RB according/VBG to/TO what/NNP 's/POS in/IN season/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ coming/VBG back/RB from/IN time/NN to/TO time/NN to/TO see/VB what/WP 's/POS new/JJ ./.
1/CD ./.
Wild/NNP salmon/NN tartare/NN with/IN nori/NN ,/, pollen/NNS and/CC tobiko/NN -/NN Easily/RB the/DT highlight/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB hard/JJ to/TO understand/NN why/IN they/PRP keep/VBP this/DT on/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC rotate/NN everything/NN else/RB !/.
Fresh/JJ salmon/NN with/IN a/DT hint/NN of/IN licorice/NN flavour/NN that/IN you/PRP wrapped/VBD in/IN seaweed/JJ sheets/NNS yourself/NN ./.
The/DT provided/NN pollen/NN was/VBD akin/VBN to/TO a/DT *very*/NN strong/JJ horseradish/JJ //NN wasabi/NN ./.
2/CD ./.
Wax/NNP bean/NN and/CC grilled/VBD calamari/NN salad/JJ -/JJ Pretty/NN underwhelming/VBG with/IN very/RB few/JJ greens/NNS and/CC even/RB less/JJR calamari/NN (/NN which/WDT tasted/VBN fresh/NN ,/, but/CC much/RB too/RB salty/JJ )/NN ./.
3/LS ./.
Trout/NNP with/IN baby/JJ heirloom/NN carrots/NNS and/CC chard/NN veloute/NN -/JJ Granted/NNP I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB trout/VBN all/PDT the/DT time/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP just/RB tasted/VBD rather/RB bland/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT texture/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ soft/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT sauce/NN did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB to/TO add/NNS or/CC enhance/VB the/DT flavour/NN of/IN the/DT trout/NN ./.

Scallops/NNS and/CC duck/NN chorizo/NN with/IN huitlacoche/NN ,/, red/VBD wine/NN ,/, and/CC nibs/VBZ -/JJ I/PRP love/VBP scallops/NNS ,/, so/RB no/DT surprise/NN I/PRP found/VBD this/DT dish/JJ delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT scallops/NNS were/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC meaty/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT duck/NN chorizo/NN paired/VBD well/RB ./.
My/NNP issue/NN ,/, again/RB ,/, came/VBD down/RB to/TO quantity/NN :/: four/CD scallops/NNS and/CC a/DT spoonful/JJ of/IN chorizo/NN for/IN $/$ 13/CD ?/CD !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP certainly/RB happy/JJ to/TO pay/NN for/IN quality/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX seemed/VBZ to/TO a/DT be/VB a/DT disconnect/NN here/RB ./.
Service/NN :/: -I/JJ found/NNS our/VBP staff/NN very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC approachable/JJ ./.
-Perhaps/NNS by/IN design/NN ,/, OR/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN since/IN we/PRP were/VBD sharing/VBG each/DT dish/JJ they/PRP accommodated/VBD by/IN bringing/NN only/RB one/CD out/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN ,/, OR/NNP we/PRP were/VBD hungrier/JJR than/IN expected/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT wait/NN seemed/VBD quite/JJ lengthy/NN between/IN dishes/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD graduation/NN from/IN the/DT U/NN of/IN T/NNP for/IN our/PRP$ niece/NN and/CC her/PRP$ boyfriend/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP left/VBP the/DT restaurant/NN choice/NN up/IN to/TO her/PRP .../: so/RB off/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN us/PRP went/VBD (/IN final/JJ tally/NN was/VBD 14/JJ )/NN to/TO celebrate/VB her/PRP MBA/NNP ./.
Several/JJ in/IN the/DT group/NN had/VBD been/VBN here/RB before/IN and/CC obviously/RB loved/VBD the/DT place/NN .../: so/IN we/PRP went/VBD with/IN an/DT open/JJ mind/NN ./.
At/IN our/PRP$ waiters/NNS recommendation/NN ,/, our/PRP$ rather/NN large/JJ table/JJ went/NN for/IN the/DT ``/`` sampler/NN meal/NN ''/'' ,/, which/WDT meant/JJ 14/NN of/IN us/PRP would/MD each/VB be/VB charged/VBN $/$ 35/CD ,/, not/RB including/VBG alcohol/NN ./.
What/WP was/VBD surprising/JJ was/VBD at/IN how/WRB small/JJ the/DT portions/NNS sizes/NNS are/VBP (/VBG yes/NNS ,/, I/PRP know/VBP this/DT is/VBZ a/DT tapas/NN style/NN place/NN ,/, so/RB portion/NN sizes/NNS are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB small/JJ )/NNS but/CC when/WRB items/NNS are/VBP put/VBN down/IN for/IN 6/JJ people/NNS to/TO share/NN and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ only/RB 4/CD or/CC 5/CD of/IN said/VBD items/NNS on/IN the/DT plate/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD to/TO cut/VB several/JJ items/NNS so/RB that/IN we/PRP could/MD all/VB sample/JJ the/DT fare/NN ./.

My/NNP brother/NN in/IN law/NN (/VBD niece/NN 's/POS father/NN and/CC a/DT meat/NN and/CC potato/NN kind/NN of/IN guy/JJ )/NNS said/VBD to/TO keep/VB the/DT food/NN coming/NN ,/, as/IN there/NNS were/VBD several/JJ items/JJ he/PRP would/MD n't/RB even/RB try/VB ./.

We/PRP stopped/VBP on/IN the/DT way/NN home/NN and/CC had/VBD a/DT nosh/JJ elsewhere/RB ./.
Like/IN I/PRP said/VBD earlier/JJR ,/, people/NNS in/IN the/DT group/NN rave/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN .../: .I/NNP guess/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB not/RB my/VB cup/NN of/IN tea/NN ./.

The/DT best/JJS dining/NN experience/NN I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN in/IN Toronto/NNP ,/, hands/NNP down/NNP ./.
The/DT emphasis/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB on/IN 'experience/NN '/POS as/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT 3/JJ hour/NN event/NN ,/, where/WRB we/PRP had/VBD no/DT idea/NN what/WP was/VBD coming/VBG next/JJ and/CC even/RB how/WRB many/JJ dishes/NNS there/EX were/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB !/.
We/PRP were/VBD served/VBN by/IN the/DT owner/NN who/WP I/PRP had/VBD to/TO refrain/NN from/IN hugging/VBG at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP restaurant/VB other/JJ reviewers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN to/TO ,/, but/CC it/PRP surely/RB was/VBD n't/RB this/DT address/property/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT menu/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT price/NN list/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP no/DT pretensions/NNS ./.
The/DT _only_/JJ thing/NN that/WDT has/VBZ a/DT ``/`` menu/NN ''/'' is/VBZ the/DT alcohol/NN list/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT set/VBN price/NN of/IN 7.00/CD per/IN glass/NN of/IN wine/NN ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT Cave/NNP Creek/NNP Riesling/NNP ,/, as/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT wine/NN I/PRP know/VBP and/CC appreciate/VB ./.
The/DT owner/NN is/VBZ the/DT chef/NN ;/: he/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT table/JJ and/CC asks/VBZ about/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN preferences/NNS ,/, allergies/NNS ,/, etc/NN ./.

The/DT five/CD courses/NNS were/VBD outstanding/JJ ./.

My/NNP partner/NNP likes/VBZ that/IN the/DT chef/NN has/VBZ a/DT deft/NN touch/NN with/IN seafood/NN -/JJ always/RB cooking/VBG it/PRP perfectly/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP like/VBP that/IN he/PRP throws/VBZ in/IN the/DT occasional/JJ hint/NN of/IN an/DT exotic/JJ flavour/NN and/CC that/IN he/PRP blends/VBZ his/PRP$ tastes/NNS PERFECTLY/NNP ./.
This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT only/JJ places/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/VBN where/WRB you/PRP HAVE/NNP to/TO eat/VB all/PDT the/DT items/NNS on/IN the/DT plate/NN together/RB because/IN that/DT 's/VBZ how/WRB they/PRP match/VBP the/DT best/NN ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, some/DT places/NNS have/VBP things/VBN here/RB and/CC there/RB and/CC they/PRP kind/VBP of/IN complement/NN each/DT other/JJ ,/, but/CC really/RB you/PRP can/MD eat/VB like/IN a/DT toddler/NN (/NN every/DT bit/NN separately/RB )/JJ ./.

2/NN of/IN us/PRP ordered/VBD 5/CD dishes/NNS ,/, and/CC shared/VBD them/PRP all/DT as/IN they/PRP came/VBD out/RP -/JJ this/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ way/NN to/TO try/VB some/DT new/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ food/NN that/IN you/PRP may/MD not/RB normally/RB order/JJ It/PRP also/RB means/VBZ the/DT dishes/NNS come/VBP out/RP one/CD at/IN a/DT time/NN as/IN they/PRP 're/VBP ready/NN ./.

:/: )/JJ Went/NNP with/IN an/DT chef/NN 's/POS choice/NN menu/NN (/NN omakase/NN ,/, tapas-style/JJ )/NN and/CC the/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD good/JJ but/CC service/NN was/VBD pretty/RB slow/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD certainly/RB pricy/JJ at/IN just/RB over/IN $/$ 50/CD per/CD person/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ if/IN everyone/NN walked/VBD away/RB full/JJ ./.
The/DT downs/NNS :/: it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT bit/NN awkward/NN to/TO share/NN food/NN plates/NNS between/IN three/CD or/CC more/JJR people/NNS too/RB ,/, especially/RB since/IN what/WP arrives/NNS at/IN your/PRP$ table/NN is/VBZ n't/RB really/RB portioned/VBN out/RP ,/, so/IN you/PRP each/DT pick/NN your/PRP$ own/JJ amounts/NNS from/IN the/DT plate/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, we/PRP waited/VBD a/DT half-hour/JJ for/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ dish/JJ to/TO arrive/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT salad/JJ ./.
The/DT furious/JJ look/NN on/IN my/NNP friend/NN 's/POS face/NN when/WRB he/PRP saw/VBD it/PRP was/VBD to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
The/DT ups/NNS :/: dishes/NNS were/VBD unique/JJ and/CC some/DT of/IN them/PRP were/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD no/DT one/NN was/VBD as/IN big/JJ a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT chanterelles/NNS as/IN I/PRP was/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD practically/RB hording/VBG the/DT black/NN cod/NN away/RB from/IN everyone/NN (/NNS your/VBP my/PRP$ friends/NNS ,/, but/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB beat/VB black/JJ cod/NN ,/, sorry/JJ guys/NNS )/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD really/RB nice/JJ and/CC friendly/RB without/IN being/VBG clingy/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, their/PRP$ beer/NN selection/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT unique/JJ side/NN and/CC reasonably/RB priced/RB ./.
Place/NNP does/VBZ accept/VB credit/NN cards/NNS ,/, so/RB bring/RB whichever/JJ form/NN of/IN plastic/JJ you/PRP want/VBP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT restaurant/NN !/.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD divine/JJ ./.
Fresh/NNP and/CC local/JJ ingredients/NNS ,/, simple/JJ dishes/NNS that/WDT exploded/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ unique/JJ and/CC complimentary/JJ flavors/NNS and/CC the/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD never/RB over/VBN powered/VBN by/IN sauces/NNS ./.
Excellent/NNP service/NN and/CC great/JJ atmosphere/NN ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB believe/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ within/IN walking/NN distance/NN !/.
Had/NNP an/DT enjoyable/JJ dinner/NN at/IN The/DT Atlantic/NNP ./.
A/DT Wednesday/NNP night/NN ,/, slushy/JJ snow/NN outside/NN ,/, not/RB many/JJ other/JJ patrons/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
Still/RB a/DT welcoming/JJ ,/, intimate/JJ atmosphere/RB ,/, and/CC somehow/VB the/DT large/JJ image/NN of/IN a/DT dead/JJ whale/NN on/IN the/DT wall/NN felt/VBD just/RB right/RB ./.
Decided/NNP on/IN the/DT tasting/VBG menu/NN ./.
Seven/NNP dishes/VBZ including/VBG ,/, soup/RB ,/, salad/RB ,/, starter/NN ,/, pasta/NN ,/, fish/JJ ,/, duck/JJ and/CC dessert/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT beginning/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD wary/JJ of/IN a/DT high/JJ pretension/NN level/NN ,/, seeing/VBG as/IN the/DT soup/NN had/VBD ``/`` truffle/NN foam/NN ''/'' ,/, the/DT salad/NN was/VBD ``/`` probiotic/JJ ''/'' and/CC the/DT starter/NN had/VBD ``/`` cedar/JJ ash/NN ,/, made/VBD in/IN house/NN ''/'' sprinkled/VBD all/DT over/IN it/PRP ./.
As/IN the/DT meal/NN moved/VBD forward/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ consumption/NN of/IN champagne/NN cocktails/NNS increased/VBD ,/, I/PRP relaxed/VBD and/CC let/VB the/DT foam/NN and/CC ash/VB wash/JJ over/IN me/PRP ./.
And/CC I/PRP settled/VBD into/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD well/RB done/VBN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD in/IN fact/NN enjoying/VBG it/PRP quite/RB a/DT bit/NN ./.
Favourite/NNP items/NNS were/VBD the/DT sunchoke/NN soup/NN with/IN hazelnut/NN granola/NN ,/, the/DT duck/NN with/IN turnip/NN and/CC mayonnaise/NN ,/, and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT desserts/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD flourless/JJ and/CC chocolate/NN ./.
Least/NNP favourite/JJ items/NNS were/VBD the/DT other/JJ dessert/NN ,/, a/DT cake/NN made/NN of/IN beets/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT arctic/JJ char/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD an/DT extremely/JJ smokey/NN flavour/NN ./.
Although/IN the/DT barley/NN risotto/NN which/WDT accompanied/VBD the/DT char/NN was/VBD absolutely/RB lovely/RB ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD almost/RB perfect/JJ ./.
Attentive/JJ without/IN being/VBG too/RB intrusive/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT servers/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO come/VB to/TO the/DT table/JJ at/IN exactly/RB the/DT right/NN times/NNS ./.
Would/NNP definitely/RB go/VB back/RB to/TO the/DT Atlantic/JJ for/IN the/DT tasting/VBG menu/NN ,/, but/CC would/MD also/RB be/VB interested/JJ in/IN trying/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT tapas-style/JJ menu/NN that/WDT others/NNS have/VBP talked/VBN about/IN ./.
P.S/NNP ./.
Short/NNP ,/, but/CC sweet/JJ cocktail/NN menu/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT Atlantic/NNP ./.
A/DT lot/NN ./.
A/DT lot/NN a/DT lot/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB been/VBN here/RB twice/JJ ,/, I/PRP leave/VBP floating/VBG on/IN cloud/NN nine/NNS because/IN hot/NN damn/RB this/DT is/VBZ it/PRP ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO really/RB appreciate/VB the/DT charms/NNS of/IN The/DT Atlantic/NNP ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN having/VBG a/DT healthy/JJ sense/NN of/IN patience/NN ,/, adventure/NN and/CC open/JJ mindedness/NN will/MD put/VB you/PRP in/IN the/DT proper/NN mind/NN space/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT good/JJ time/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD introduced/VBN to/TO the/DT Atlantic/NNP by/IN a/DT good/JJ friend/NN of/IN mine/NN about/IN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, he/PRP lives/VBZ in/IN the/DT area/NN and/CC wanted/VBD to/TO share/VB the/DT experience/NN ./.
We/PRP settled/VBD up/RP to/TO the/DT bar/NN since/IN it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN on/IN this/DT specific/JJ evening/NN and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB call/VB ahead/RB with/IN reservations/NNS ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN their/PRP$ throwback/NN vintage/NN cocktails/NNS ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB quite/RB remember/VB the/DT names/NNS of/IN what/WP I/PRP was/VBD drinking/VBG .../: something/NN with/IN Zombie/NNP in/IN the/DT name/NN ?/.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Then/RB I/PRP had/VBD something/VBN different/JJ with/IN bourbon/NN and/CC orange/NN bitters/NNS and/CC that/DT was/VBD super/NN good/JJ too/NN ./.
Nice/NNP and/CC strong/JJ ,/, just/RB the/DT way/NN I/PRP like/IN it/PRP ./.
He/PRP had/VBD something/VBN with/IN kombucha/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
Kombucha/NNP beer/NN ?/.
Who/NNP knows/VBZ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD superb/JJ anyway/NN ./.
God/NNP damn/VBD Good/NNP cocktails/NNS ./.
And/CC then/RB we/PRP started/VBP feeling/VBG peckish/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN is/VBZ a/DT 'burner/NN '/POS (/NN he/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN to/TO Burning/NNP Man/NNP )/NNP ,/, so/IN the/DT guy/NN will/MD try/VB anything/NN once/RB ,/, twice/RB if/IN he/PRP likes/VBZ it/PRP ,/, and/CC three/CD times/NNS if/IN it/PRP amazing/VBP ./.
And/CC I/PRP like/IN eating/VBG weird/JJ things/NNS ,/, so/IN we/PRP held/VBP each/DT other/JJ 's/POS hand/NNS and/CC forayed/VBN together/RP into/IN the/DT ~mystery/JJ tasting/VBG menu~/NN (/NNS not/RB exactly/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT mystery/NN ,/, the/DT plates/NNS were/VBD explained/VBN to/TO us/PRP as/IN we/PRP received/VBP them/PRP ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD an/DT air/NN of/IN spontaneity/NN &/CC teasing/NN in/IN not/RB exactly/RB knowing/VBG what/WP you/PRP 'd/MD get/VB right/RB until/IN the/DT last/JJ moment/NN )/NN ./.
And/CC Holy/NNP cannoli/NN that/WDT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS food/NN I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ./.
The/DT stand/NN outs/NNS were/VBD a/DT nettle/JJ soup/NN (/IN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD reservations/NNS about/IN because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP used/JJ to/TO having/NN that/IN in/IN tea/NN ,/, or/CC buying/VB it/PRP at/IN the/DT farmers/NNS market/NN and/CC then/RB being/VBG confused/VBN about/IN how/CD to/TO cook/VB it/PRP cause/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ prickley/JJ !/NN )/.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT beautiful/JJ blended/JJ little/JJ soup/NN ./.

Then/RB some/DT AMAZING/NNP DUCK/NNP ./.
And/CC then/RB some/DT other/JJ amazing/VBG funky/JJ dishes/NNS that/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB quite/VB remember/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD almost/RB like/IN a/DT food/NN dream/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD gone/NN to/TO heaven/VB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD dead/JJ ./.
Dead/NNP in/IN a/DT good/JJ way/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, very/RB recently/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD the/DT urge/NN to/TO return/NN to/TO the/DT Atlantic/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO drag/VB my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN ,/, who/WP is/VBZ NOT/NNP a/DT venturesome/NN eater/NN ./.
He/PRP 's/VBZ picky/JJ ,/, and/CC he/PRP loves/VBZ chicken/NN ;/: chicken/NN schnitzel/NN ,/, chicken/VBN cordon/NN bleu/NN ,/, chicken/VBN Caesar/NNP salad/NN ,/, butter/NN chicken/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB does/VBZ n't/RB eat/VB vegetables/NNS ,/, but/CC he/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ sport/NN and/CC decided/VBD to/TO buckle/NN down/IN and/CC go/VBP for/IN the/DT tasting/VBG menu/NN experience/NN ./.
Nathan/NNP (/VBD head/NN chef/NN ,/, bartender/NN ,/, server/NN ,/, jack/NN of/IN all/DT trades/NNS )/VBP came/VBD up/RP to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC explained/VBD the/DT concept/NN of/IN his/PRP$ operation/NN ,/, we/PRP could/MD go/VB for/IN the/DT pwyc/NN tasting/VBG menu/NN ,/, or/CC basically/RB let/VB him/PRP know/VB what/WP we/PRP felt/VBP like/IN eating/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP would/MD whip/VB something/NN up/RB ./.
I/PRP also/RB playfully/RB explained/VBN to/TO Nathan/NNP about/IN my/NNP bf/NN 's/POS hate/NN for/IN veggies/NNS and/CC Nathan/NNP said/VBD ,/, with/IN a/DT totally/RB dead/JJ pan/NN look/NN ``/`` Well/NNP .../: my/JJ food/NN is/VBZ vegetable/JJ based/VBN ./. ''/''
And/CC then/RB we/PRP all/DT had/VBD a/DT good/JJ laugh/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB explained/VBD that/IN he/PRP could/MD whip/VB us/PRP up/IN a/DT nice/JJ bowl/NN of/IN pasta/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT curry/JJ ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ bf/NN was/VBD like/IN ,/, YA/NNP KNOW/NNP WHAT/NNP ,/, FUCK/NNP IT/NNP ,/, LETS/NNP DO/NNP THIS/NNP TASTING/NNP MENU/NNP I/PRP 'M/VBP READY/NNP ./.
The/DT thing/NN about/RB Nathan/JJ is/VBZ he/PRP can/MD be/VB accommodating/VBG as/IN all/DT heck/NN ,/, or/CC you/PRP can/MD put/VB your/PRP$ faith/NN in/IN his/PRP$ talent/NN and/CC let/VB him/PRP call/VB the/DT shots/NNS with/IN his/PRP$ tasting/NN menu/NN ./.
And/CC you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB regret/VB either/DT choice/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT creamy/NN soup/NN with/IN lentils/NNS ,/, a/DT lovely/RB salad/JJ with/IN cabbage/NN and/CC cauliflower/NN ./.
And/CC then/RB I/PRP started/VBP talking/VBG about/IN HOW/NNP OBSESSED/NNP I/PRP AM/VBP WITH/NNP oysters/NNS with/IN my/PRP$ bf/NN ,/, and/CC Nathan/NNP just/RB glided/VBN on/IN by/NN and/CC said/VBD ``/`` .../: you/PRP guys/VBZ want/IN some/DT oysters/NNS ?/.
I/PRP have/VBP some/DT nice/JJ ones/NNS .../: ''/'' Um/NNP heck/NNP yea/NN we/PRP do/VBP ./.
LIKE/NNP WHO/NNP EVEN/NNP DOES/NNP THAT/NNP ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT perks/NNS of/IN having/VBG an/DT observant/NN chef/NN mill/NN about/IN his/PRP$ restaurant/NN and/CC interact/NN with/IN patrons/NNS ./.
All/IN the/DT gold/NN stars/NNS Mr./NNP Isberg/NNP ./.
Then/RB on/IN to/TO the/DT delectable/JJ rainbow/NN trout/NN on/IN a/DT bed/VBN of/IN black/NN rice/NN risotto/NN ,/, fan-fucking-tastic/JJ gnudi/NN ,/, the/DT famous/JJ crickets/NNS (/VBP loved/VBN it/PRP )/-NONE- ,/, and/CC finally/RB ,/, the/DT tobacco/NN crème/NN brule/NN (/IN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD a/DT hard/JJ time/NN with/IN since/IN that/DT spicy/NN kick/NN from/IN the/DT tobacco/NN was/VBD too/RB much/JJ for/IN my/NN little/NN throat/NN -/JJ the/DT bf/NN loved/VBD it/PRP though/IN ,/, SURPRISE/NNP HE/NNP 'S/NNPS A/DT SMOKER/NNP ./. )/''
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT wonderful/JJ night/NN ,/, the/DT service/NN slowed/VBD down/RP towards/NNS the/DT end/NN as/IN the/DT place/NN started/VBD to/TO fill/NN up/RB ,/, but/CC we/PRP had/VBD basically/VBN finished/VBN our/PRP$ meal/NN by/IN then/RB and/CC were/VBD also/RB too/RB busy/JJ having/VBG a/DT fantastic/JJ conversation/NN about/IN our/CD plan/NN for/IN the/DT apocalypse/NN -/JJ Possibly/RB involves/VBZ a/DT boat/NN ,/, Cuba/NNP ,/, and/CC farming/VBG ./.
Nathan/NNP also/RB gives/VBZ me/PRP Aphex/NNP twin/NN vibes/NNS with/IN his/PRP$ look/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP love/VBP Apehx/NNP Twin/NNP ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD like/IN Aphex/NNP Twin/NNP was/VBD serving/VBG me/PRP amazing/JJ food/NN ./.
Good/NNP times/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sorry/JJ to/TO rate/NN this/DT restaurant/NN so/RB poorly/RB ,/, because/IN they/PRP are/VBP nice/JJ people/NNS and/CC they/PRP try/VBP hard/RB ./.
But/CC it/PRP just/RB did/VBD n't/RB work/VB for/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT tapas/NN concept/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP were/VBD gently/RB and/CC friendly-like/JJ advised/NN of/IN how/WRB it/PRP worked/VBD as/IN we/PRP were/VBD handed/VBN menus/NNS ./.
As/IN other/JJ reviewers/NNS have/VBP commented/VBN ,/, though/RB ,/, in/IN practise/NN ,/, the/DT dishes/NNS come/VBP out/RP staggered/VBN with/IN long/JJ gaps/NNS between/IN them/PRP and/CC if/IN someone/NN has/VBZ their/PRP$ heart/NN set/NN on/IN an/DT entree/NN ,/, then/RB sharing/NN is/VBZ n't/RB always/RB going/VBG to/TO happen/VB ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ what/WP happened/VBN with/IN me/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN ./.
She/PRP wanted/VBD the/DT Scallops/NNP [/NNP painfully/RB overpriced/VBN at/IN $/$ 16/CD for/IN two/CD ,/, on/IN much-too-al-dente/JJ pasta/NN ]/NN and/CC I/PRP wanted/VBD the/DT Trout/NNP ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT 10/CD minute/JJ gap/NN between/IN our/PRP$ dishes/NNS ,/, which/WDT made/-NONE- for/IN awkward/NN dining/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN my/PRP$ trout/NN (/NN hay-smoked/JJ )/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, but/CC just/RB nice/JJ ./.
The/DT accompanying/VBG pea/NN shoots/NNS were/VBD cooked/VBN into/IN boiled-spinach-like/JJ oblivion/NN and/CC the/DT potatoes/NNS were/VBD fine/RB ,/, but/CC nothing/NN special/NN ./.
The/DT dashi/NNP broth/NN offered/VBD nothing/NN to/TO enhance/VB the/DT dish/JJ ,/, disappointingly/RB ./.
The/DT liver/NN pate/NN was/VBD the/DT smoothest/NN I/PRP 'd/MD ever/RB eaten/VB ,/, with/IN seasoning/NN like/IN BBQ/NNP Chinese/NNP pork/NN (/VBD 5/CD spice/NN )/NN ?/.
Pleasant/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB swoon/JJ worthy/JJ ./.
The/DT beet-based/JJ salad/NN was/VBD lovely/RB ./.
Probably/RB the/DT best/JJS thing/NN I/PRP had/VBD that/DT night/NN ./.
Perhaps/NNP my/NNP expectations/NNS were/VBD too/RB high/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN told/VBN this/DT place/NN was/VBD a/DT gem/NN and/CC expected/VBN unique/JJ flavours/NNS that/WDT just/RB were/VBD n't/RB delivered/JJ ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD okay/JJ ,/, but/CC just/RB okay/NN ./.
And/CC this/DT restaurant/NN cost/NN too/RB much/RB for/IN a/DT modest/JJ meal/NN for/IN two/CD (/NNS $/$ 70/CD ,/, with/IN two/CD glasses/NNS of/IN port/NN )/NN for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB just/RB okay/JJ ./.
Also/RB ,/, a/DT nitpick/JJ :/: if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB a/DT very/RB dimly/JJ lit/NN restaurant/NN ,/, choose/VB a/DT bolder/NN typeface/NN for/IN your/PRP$ menu/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB hard/JJ to/TO read/VB the/DT superfine/NN typeface/NN they/PRP 'd/VBP used/RB ./.
A/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO go/VB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN an/DT adventurous/JJ mood/NN ./.
Surveying/VBG the/DT constantly-changing/NN menu/NN at/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, I/PRP always/RB find/VBP several/JJ items/ingredients/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB heard/NN of/IN ./.
The/DT chef/NN at/IN Atlantic/JJ really/RB knows/VBZ what/WP he/PRP 's/VBZ doing/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT ideal/JJ place/NN to/TO try/VB new/JJ things/NNS ,/, prepared/RB as/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.
The/DT ambience/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN like/IN a/DT bar/NN ;/: sort/NN a/DT Communist/NNP Daughter/NNP vibe/NN ,/, candlelit/NN and/CC with/IN vintage/NN touches/NNS ./.
In/IN fact/NN I/PRP sometimes/RB stop/VBP in/IN here/RB just/RB for/IN a/DT cocktail/NN or/CC a/DT glass/NN of/IN wine/NN ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ given/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN ingredients/NNS and/CC preparation/NN ,/, such/JJ that/IN you/PRP can/MD sample/VB a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN things/NNS without/IN breaking/VBG the/DT bank/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT whole/JJ more/RBR laid/JJ back/RB than/IN comparable/JJ places/NNS on/IN Ossington/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP able/JJ to/TO relax/NN and/CC order/sample/NN things/NNS at/IN a/DT relaxed/VBN pace/NN ./.
Recommended/JJ ./.
Definitely/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ an/DT old/JJ dive/JJ that/NN 's/POS been/VBN renovated/VBN and/CC is/VBZ owned/VBN by/IN a/DT wicked/JJ guy/NN named/NN Nathan/NNP ./.
So/RB ,/, by/IN evening/NN they/PRP serve/VBP local/JJ food/NN ./.
By/IN local/JJ ,/, i/JJ mean/IN he/PRP 'll/MD tell/VB you/PRP what/WP town/VBN the/DT lettuce/NN came/VBD from/IN ,/, what/WP lake/VB the/DT trout/NN came/VBD from/IN ,/, and/CC where/WRB he/PRP found/VBD those/DT delicious/JJ frogs/NNS legs/NNS ./.
Menu/NNP is/VBZ quite/JJ large/JJ considering/VBG the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT room/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ varied/VBN -/JJ definitely/RB French/JJ and/CC Italian/JJ references/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB affordable/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN food/NN served/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
By/IN great/JJ ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ obvious/JJ these/DT guys/NNS are/VBP hustling/VBG and/CC trying/VBG to/TO make/VB a/DT successful/JJ spot/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, after/IN the/DT dinner/NN service/NN is/VBZ over/IN ,/, I/PRP strongly/RB recommend/VBP sticking/VBG around/IN on/IN Friday/NNP nights/NNS ,/, because/IN it/PRP turns/VBZ into/IN a/DT mad/JJ dance/NN party/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN a/DT smoke/NN machine/NN ,/, lasers/NNS ,/, pillow/NN fights/NNS ,/, a/DT kiddie/NN pool/NN ,/, disco/NN ball/NN ,/, glow/NN in/IN the/DT dark/JJ paint/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB the/DT idea/NN ./.
Unexpected/IN is/VBZ the/DT key/JJ word/NN ./.
A/DT friend/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD looking/VBG for/IN a/DT gastronomic/JJ restaurant/NN to/TO celebrate/VB an/DT event/NN ./.
After/IN looking/NN at/IN the/DT usual/JJ Gusto/NNP ,/, Buca/NNP ,/, Morton/NNP etc/NNP ./.
and/CC not/RB feeling/VBG super/NN motivated/VBN by/IN the/DT usual/JJ Toronto/NNP decor/NN (/NN although/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO some/DT and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ nonetheless/JJ good/JJ )/NN ,/, a/DT friend/NN of/IN mine/NN ,/, cook/NN at/IN Enoteca/NNP Sociale/NNP ,/, mentioned/VBD The/DT Atlantic/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB really/RB able/JJ to/TO tell/NN what/WP they/PRP were/VBD doing/VBG except/IN for/IN ``/`` very/RB good/JJ ''/'' and/CC ``/`` pricey/NN ''/'' ./.
Being/NNP two/CD French/NNP girls/NNS craving/VBG for/IN good/JJ food/NN ,/, we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO take/VB the/DT chance/NN and/CC dive/JJ in/IN the/DT unknown/NN ./.
Note/NNP we/PRP read/VBP other/JJ reviews/NNS and/CC we/PRP knew/VBD the/DT menu/NN was/VBD changed/VBN regularly/RB ,/, but/CC no/DT idea/NN what/WP was/VBD on/IN the/DT plate/NN for/IN the/DT night/NN (/VBD Oct/NNP 30/CD 2013/CD )/NNS ./.
We/PRP called/VBD to/TO reserve/VB at/IN the/DT opening/NNP -/JJ 7pm/CD ;/: and/CC when/WRB my/JJ friend/NN asked/NN for/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD told/JJ it/PRP was/VBD a/DT single/JJ 6-course/JJ surprise/NN menu/NN ./.
That/DT sounds/VBZ exciting/VBG !/.
So/RB there/RB we/PRP went/VBD ,/, and/CC yep/NN ,/, does/VBZ n't/RB look/VB very/RB fancy/JJ with/IN this/DT blue/JJ and/CC white/JJ Atlantic/JJ sign/NN ;/: the/DT glass/NN allowed/VBD us/PRP to/TO see/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD empty/JJ and/CC quite/JJ dark/NN in/IN the/DT inside/NN ./.
Well/NNP ,/, in/IN we/PRP went/VBD ,/, as/IN the/DT cook/NN and/CC the/DT waiter/NN stepped/VBD in/IN behind/NN us/PRP ./.

A/DT little/JJ chilly/NN ?/.

And/CC from/IN there/RB ,/, it/PRP only/RB got/VBD better/RBR ./.
As/IN the/DT restaurant/NN slowly/RB filled/VBD up/RP (/CD around/IN 14/CD persons/NNS for/IN the/DT whole/JJ evening/NN ,/, half/DT full/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD Wednesday/NNP night/NNP )/NNP ,/, Scott/NNP came/VBD with/IN a/DT suite/NN of/IN 6/NNP plates/NNS ,/, sometimes/RB one/CD each/NN ,/, sometimes/RB to/TO share/NN ./.

A/DT good/JJ bowl/NN of/IN homemade/NN soup/NN !/.
At/IN an/DT adapted/VBN pace/NN ,/, we/PRP then/RB went/VBD with/IN the/DT following/VBG dishes/NNS :/: -/JJ Apple/NN and/CC house-smoked/JJ white/JJ fish/JJ salad/NN with/IN some/DT vinaigrette/NN reduction/NN (/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ of/IN the/DT leafs/NN name/NN but/CC it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN cloverleaves/NNS salad/JJ )/IN =/NNP I/PRP would/MD have/VB killed/VBN for/IN the/DT fish/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD perfect/JJ -/JJ Cottage/NN cheese/NN gnocchi/NN style/NN ball/NN rolled/VBD in/IN alfalfa/NN ashes/NNS ,/, served/VBN with/IN Brussels/NNS sprouts/VBZ leafs/NNS ``/`` blanchie/NN ''/'' =/NN from/IN the/DT morning/NN perspective/NN ,/, this/DT was/VBD my/VBN least/NN favorite/JJ dish/JJ ,/, and/CC so/RB was/VBD it/PRP for/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN ./.

But/CC one/CD sure/JJ thing/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD getting/VBG very/RB full/JJ ./.
The/DT waiter/NN was/VBD full/JJ of/IN attention/NN and/CC regularly/RB came/VBD to/TO check/NN on/IN us/PRP ./.
-/JJ Crème/NN Brule=/NNP Traditionally/NNP made/NNP ,/, perfectly/RB executed/VBN ./.
We/PRP talked/VBD a/DT lot/NN with/IN Scott/NNP who/WP then/RB introduced/VBD us/PRP to/TO the/DT cook/NN Nolan/NN ,/, whom/WP we/PRP congratulated/VBD warmly/RB for/IN such/JJ 1/CD Michelin/NNP star/NN like/IN meal/NN (/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO one/CD star/NN )/NN ./.
Here/RB is/VBZ some/DT info/NN from/IN the/DT inside/NN :/: -/JJ Scott/NNP and/CC Nolan/NNP are/VBP by-themselves/NNS all/DT nights/NNS to/TO serve/VB and/CC please/VB all/PDT the/DT guests/NNS ./.

Keep/NNP it/PRP in/IN mind/NN ./.
Another/DT idea/NN for/IN later/JJ is/VBZ to/TO adapt/VB a/DT menu/NN to/TO a/DT client/NN request/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, they/PRP are/VBP very/RB big/JJ on/IN personifying/VBG their/PRP$ food/NN to/TO your/PRP$ liking/NN ./.

Unexpected/VBN !/NN !/.
-/JJ If/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB read/VBN reviews/NNS in/IN the/DT local/JJ newspapers/NNS ,/, is/VBZ because/IN the/DT staff/NN would/MD rather/RB wait/VB until/IN the/DT renovations/NNS of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN are/VBP engaged/JJ and/CC completed/JJ ./.
(/IN Yes/NNPS ,/, it/PRP will/MD look/VB better/RBR soon/RB !/. )/.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT bar/NN across/IN from/IN them/PRP is/VBZ a/DT friend/NN ./.
Go/NNP there/EX for/IN a/DT good/JJ whiskey/NN to/TO digest/VB your/PRP$ diner/NN !/.

They/PRP also/RB change/VBP their/PRP$ menu/NN daily/NN or/CC every/DT few/JJ days/NNS so/IN its/PRP$ hard/JJ to/TO really/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO expect/VB but/CC they/PRP are/VBP creative/JJ with/IN their/PRP$ food/NN and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP I/PRP appreciate/VBP ./.

They/PRP had/VBD me/PRP at/IN hello/NN or/CC should/MD I/PRP say/VBP AHOY/NNP !/.
I/PRP feel/VBP really/RB mixed/VBN about/IN this/DT place/NN but/CC this/DT could/MD be/VB due/JJ to/TO the/DT delicious/JJ bottle/NN of/IN wine/NN I/PRP shared/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN (/NN Cote/NNP Du/NNP Rhone/NNP -/JJ order/NN it/PRP )/VBD that/IN may/MD have/VB impaired/VBN my/PRP$ judgement/NN ./.

No/DT worries/NNS .../: still/RB read/VB on/IN ,/, I/PRP promise/VBP you/PRP can/MD trust/VB this/DT review/NN ./.
Reading/VBG the/DT menu/NN online/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT reviews/NNS off/IN yelp/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG a/DT seafood/fish/JJ overload/NN ,/, but/CC was/VBD a/DT little/JJ disappointed/JJ by/IN the/DT 'day/NNP 's/POS menu/NN offerings/NNS ./.
When/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD they/PRP informed/VBD us/PRP that/IN a/DT few/JJ items/NNS sold/VBD out/RP on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ thrown/NN off/NN by/IN this/DT but/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN you/PRP come/VBP to/TO accept/VB this/DT possibility/NN at/IN these/DT type/NN of/IN restaurants/NNS ./.
Actually/RB comforts/VBZ me/PRP that/IN they/PRP 're/VBP not/RB over/IN buying/NN ingredients/NNS -/JJ meaning/NN no/DT freezing/NN !/.
They/PRP also/RB change/VBP their/PRP$ menu/NN daily/NN or/CC every/DT few/JJ days/NNS so/IN its/PRP$ hard/JJ to/TO really/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO expect/NNS ./.
I/PRP get/VBP bored/VBN easily/RB so/RB a/DT constant/JJ changing/NN menu/NN is/VBZ perfect/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
Highs/NNP -/JJ The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP equally/RB matched/VBN to/TO the/DT portion/NN sizes/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN at/IN how/WRB much/JJ was/VBD given/VBN for/IN 'tapas/NNS '/POS style/JJ plates/NNS ./.

Everyone/NNP seems/VBZ like/IN a/DT big/JJ family/NN ./.

-/JJ Great/JJ music/JJ Lows/NNP -/JJ Some/NN of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS lacked/VBD real/JJ flavour/NN or/CC were/VBD a/DT bit/NN over/IN salted/JJ ./.
-/JJ Unfortunately/RB we/PRP were/VBD unimpressed/VBN by/IN the/DT only/JJ two/CD seafood/NN dishes/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
the/DT Lobster/NNP Carbonara/NNP (/NNP It/NNP 's/POS lobster/JJ month/NN )/NN -/JJ The/DT capers/NNS over/IN powered/VBN the/DT whole/JJ dish/JJ and/CC made/VBD it/PRP inedible/JJ AND/NNP Scallops/NNP with/IN black/JJ beans/NNS -/JJ They/PRP were/VBD slightly/RB undercooked/JJ and/CC the/DT beans/NNS were/VBD el/JJ dente/JJ but/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD them/PRP more/JJR than/IN the/DT scallops/NNS ./.
To/TO be/VB fair/JJ we/NNS were/VBD both/DT extremely/JJ full/NN by/IN this/DT point/NN and/CC scallops+full/NN stomach/NN =/NN probably/RB not/RB a/DT smart/NN choice/NN ./.

A/DT complete/NN and/CC utter/JJ disappointment/NN ./.

They/PRP 're/VBP right/RB ./.

Even/RB the/DT ``/`` hazelnut/NN greens/NNS ''/'' should/MD have/VB been/VBN subtitled/VBN ``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP sorry/JJ ,/, but/CC tonight/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN hazelnuts/NNS is/VBZ being/VBG played/VBN by/IN Sodium/NNP Chloride/NNP ./. ''/''
We/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO take/VB our/RP resting/VBG blood/NN pressure/NN before/IN and/CC after/IN dinner/NN to/TO see/VB how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD affected/VBN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD spectacular/JJ ./.
Our/NNP wonderful/JJ waitress/NN kept/VBD our/PRP$ water/NN glasses/NNS full/JJ throughout/IN the/DT voyage/NN to/TO the/DT saltiest/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT sea/NN ./.

Our/NNP simple/NN dinner/NN ended/VBD up/RP costing/JJ about/IN the/DT same/JJ as/IN 100/CD cans/NNS of/IN tuna/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD two/CD weeks/NNS ago/IN .../:

Not/RB seafood/NN ,/, I/PRP know/VBP ./.
But/CC these/DT gems/NNS were/VBD oh/JJ so/RB flavourful/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO note/NN that/IN this/DT meal/NN took/VBD 4.5/CD hours.The/NN food/NN was/VBD very/RB slow/JJ to/TO come/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP had/VBD complimentary/JJ spicy/NN olives/NNS and/CC bread/JJ to/TO tide/NN us/NN over/IN ./.

The/DT major/JJ change/NN since/IN then/RB is/VBZ the/DT PWYC/NNP concept/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN no/DT fixed/NN menu/NN ./.
Nathan/NNP ,/, head/NN chef/owner/server/NN was/VBD super/JJ focused/VBN on/IN giving/NNS us/PRP a/DT great/JJ dinner/NN and/CC we/PRP had/VBD nothing/VBN less/JJR than/IN that/DT ./.

The/DT variety/NN presented/VBD on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB in/IN ingredients/NNS but/CC in/IN seasonings/NNS and/CC preparation/NN ,/, was/VBD a/DT perfect/JJ balance/NN of/IN diversity/NN and/CC confluence/NN of/IN a/DT singular/JJ vision/NN ./.

I/PRP could/MD go/VB through/IN each/DT delightful/JJ dish/JJ ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ so/RB boring/VBG ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT passion/NN ,/, skill/NN and/CC attention/NN to/TO nuanced/JJ matching/NN of/IN flavors/NNS that/WDT distinguish/JJ both/DT the/DT menu/NN as/IN a/DT whole/JJ ,/, and/CC each/DT plate/NN delivered/VBZ that/IN has/VBZ made/VBN this/DT my/NN new/JJ favorite/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
Well/NNP okay/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD describe/VB a/DT few/JJ dishes/NNS ./.
The/DT Lobster/NNP Bisque/NNP had/VBD the/DT deep/NN yet/RB delicate/JJ aroma/NN one/CD always/NN hopes/NN for/IN but/CC rarely/RB gets/NNS ./.
A/DT combination/NN of/IN essence/NN of/IN Lobster/NNP ,/, Ocean/NNP and/CC Culture/NNP ,/, when/WRB one/CD is/VBZ both/DT at/IN service/NN to/TO the/DT Lobster/NNP ,/, and/CC yet/RB masters/VBZ the/DT difficulty/NN of/IN coaxing/VBG the/DT true/JJ flavors/NNS out/IN of/IN their/PRP$ shell/NN ./.

But/CC stop/VBP reading/NN this/DT and/CC go/NN ./.
Was/NNP there/VBD a/DT flaw/NN ?/.
Well/NNP I/PRP think/VBP if/IN the/DT lone/NN front/NN of/IN the/DT house/NN person/NN had/VBD a/DT sidekick/NN ,/, that/WDT would/MD have/VB been/VBN nice/JJ ,/, for/IN everyone/NN ./.

If/IN someone/NN wanted/VBD to/TO apprentice/VB ,/, to/TO be/VB close/JJ to/TO a/DT chef/NN who/WP is/VBZ truly/RB talented/VBN ,/, the/DT learnings/NNS would/MD be/VB more/RBR than/IN adequate/JJ compensation/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD way/NN too/RB long/JJ to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN tasty/NN but/CC definitely/RB healthy/JJ ./.
After/IN the/DT 2.5/CD hr/NN affair/NN ,/, my/PRP$ friend/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD looking/VBG for/IN pizza/NN ./.

This/DT chef/NN have/VBP to/TO serve/VB and/CC cook/VB the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, no/DT wonder/NN it/PRP takes/VBZ 3/JJ hrs/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN we/PRP both/DT got/NNS diarrhea/NN too/RB ./.
