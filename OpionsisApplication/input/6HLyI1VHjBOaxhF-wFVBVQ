I/PRP popped/VBD in/IN to/TO the/DT Tammie/NNP Coe/NNP on/IN Roosevelt/NNP in/IN mid/JJ December/NNP to/TO order/VB one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ standard/JJ cakes/NNS for/IN my/NN birthday/NN that/IN week/NN ./.

As/IN it/PRP turns/VBZ out/RP ,/, the/DT standard/JJ cakes/NNS listed/VBN on/IN the/DT website/JJ are/VBP not/RB standard/JJ in/IN December/NNP ,/, and/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VBP what/WP is/VBZ normally/RB offered/VBD the/DT other/JJ 11/CD months/NNS out/IN of/IN the/DT year/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT ``/`` special/JJ order/NN ''/'' in/IN December/NNP ./.
