I/PRP literally/RB gobbled/VBD 2/CD bites/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ tasty/NN ,/, hot/NN food/NN ,/, had/VBD it/PRP boxed/VBD up/RB ,/, and/CC ate/VB at/IN home/NN ,/, from/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ clean/JJ counter/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP on/IN a/DT strict/JJ diet/NN right/NN now/RB and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP an/DT egg/NN subsitute/NN omelette/NN and/CC generally/RB when/WRB I/PRP order/VBP such/JJ items/NNS I/PRP doust/VBP them/PRP in/IN tabasco/NN .../: this/DT one/NN .../: I/PRP shook/VBP a/DT little/JJ salt/NN on/IN it/PRP and/CC devoured/VBD it/PRP with/IN no/DT sauce/NN ./.
First/NNP time/NNP ever/NNP ./.
Yum/NNP !/.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP slightly/RB higher/JJR than/IN I/PRP 'd/VBP like/IN ,/, but/CC they/PRP provide/VBP several/JJ coupons/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ website/JJ each/DT month/NN ./.
Continuing/NNP our/VBD search/NN for/IN the/DT perfect/NN breakfast/NN restaurant/NN ,/, this/DT was/VBD the/DT second/JJ Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP we/NNP sampled/VBD ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, not/RB spectacular/JJ but/CC very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Big/NNP Bad/NNP Wolf/NNP omelet/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD properly/RB named/VBN ./.
Packed/NNP with/IN heart-stopping/JJ meats/NNS surrounded/VBD by/IN the/DT omelet/NN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB fit/VBN for/IN a/DT wolf/NN ./.
The/DT hash-browns/NNS were/VBD good/JJ too/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO let/VB most/JJS of/IN them/PRP go/VBP just/RB to/TO get/VB the/DT omelet/NN stuffed/VBD in/IN ./.
Being/NNP gluten/NN intolerant/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB eat/VB the/DT coffee/NN cake/NN ,/, which/WDT my/NNP wife/NN said/VBD was/VBD good/JJ as/IN well/RB ,/, And/CC my/PRP$ cake/NN gave/VBD her/PRP a/DT second/JJ one/CD to/TO take/VB home/NN for/IN later/JJ ./.
She/PRP also/RB had/VBD the/DT chicken/VBN fried/JJ steak/NN which/WDT she/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBD ./.
The/DT negatives/NNS and/CC reason/NN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB five/JJ stars/NNS is/VBZ that/IN there/RB was/VBD a/DT fair/NN wait/NN to/TO be/VB seated/VBN ./.
Luckily/NNP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ day/NN and/CC we/PRP could/MD sit/VB outside/NN on/IN the/DT food-court/JJ seating/NN ./.
Inside/NNP waiting/NN is/VBZ minimal/JJ ./.
I/PRP admit/VBP we/PRP are/VBP slow/JJ starters/NNS ,/, and/CC came/VBD at/IN the/DT peak/NN hour/NN ,/, so/RB maybe/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP an/DT early/JJ riser/NN there/NN might/MD not/RB be/VB so/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT wait/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, being/VBG full/NN and/CC the/DT seating/VBG closely/RB set/VBN it/PRP was/VBD rather/RB noisy/JJ inside/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB the/DT first/JJ to/TO post/VB the/DT ``/`` no/DT WiFi/NNP photo/NN ''/'' but/CC I/PRP have/VBP posted/VBN it/PRP again/RB to/TO bring/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT front/NN because/IN their/PRP$ admonition/NN to/TO talk/VB like/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ 1995/CD was/VBD being/VBG followed/VBN with/IN gusto/NN ./.
Still/RB ,/, once/RB seated/VBD the/DT service/NN was/VBD quick/JJ and/CC the/DT staff/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/RB and/CC most/RBS helpful/JJ ./.
And/CC that/IN often/RB makes/VBZ up/RP for/IN any/DT bumps/NNS in/IN the/DT road/NN ./.
And/CC fie/VBP on/IN me/PRP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP so/RB used/VBN to/TO eating/VBG around/IN my/PRP$ gluten/NN intolerance/NN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB ask/VB if/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ menu/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP discovered/VBD after/IN I/PRP had/VBD eaten/VBN my/PRP$ fill/NN ./.

We/PRP just/RB decided/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN yesterday/NN morning/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD so/RB impressed/VBN that/IN we/PRP came/VBD back/RB again/RB this/DT morning/NN ./.
That/DT says/VBZ a/DT lot/NN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB ,/, very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO start/VB things/NNS off/IN by/IN mentioning/NN the/DT one/CD dish/JJ that/IN caused/JJ me/NNS to/TO drop/VB this/DT from/IN a/DT 5/NN to/TO a/DT 4/NN star/NN review/NN :/: the/DT coffee/NN cake/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB really/RB a/DT big/JJ cake/NN fan/NN ,/, but/CC after/IN reading/NN all/DT of/IN the/DT glowing/VBG reviews/NNS ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB theirs/NNS a/DT shot/NN ./.
Any/NNP quality/NN it/PRP might/MD of/IN had/NN was/VBD instantly/RB and/CC unforgivably/RB overridden/VBN by/IN that/DT distinct/JJ ,/, tell-tale/JJ taste/NN and/CC texture/NN of/IN a/DT microwave/NN !/.
What/WP the/DT hell/NN ?/.
A/DT microwave/NN ?/.
Yeah/NNP ,/, sure/NNP ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN taste-deadening/NN ,/, corner-cutting/JJ ,/, smoke/NN &/CC mirrors/NNS crap/NN people/NNS expect/VBP from/IN a/DT Taco/NNP Bell/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB at/IN a/DT place/NN like/IN this/DT ./.
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB disappointing/JJ and/CC ,/, being/VBG the/DT first/JJ dish/JJ out/NN ,/, a/DT rather/RB disheartening/JJ first-impression/NN too/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP read/JJ people/NNS 's/POS reviews/NNS ,/, where/WRB they/PRP talk/VBP about/IN how/WRB ``/`` steamy/JJ ''/'' and/CC ``/`` fresh/JJ ''/'' it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, but/CC the/DT steam/NN is/VBZ artificial/JJ and/CC the/DT ``/`` fresh/JJ ''/'' appearance/NN is/VBZ completely/RB false/JJ ./.
At/IN least/JJS to/TO anyone/NN clever/NN enough/RB to/TO understand/NN that/IN ,/, unless/IN you/PRP time/VBP things/NNS unnaturally/RB well/RB ,/, no/DT cake/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO ever/RB be/VB served/VBN ``/`` steaming/JJ fresh/NN ''/'' at/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ./.
Considering/NNP how/WRB good/JJ and/CC legitimately-fresh/JJ the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ ,/, this/DT approach/NN really/RB ,/, REALLY/NNP baffles/NNS me/PRP ./.
Trust/NNP me/NNP ,/, guys/NNS ,/, your/PRP$ cake/NN would/MD be/VB so/RB much/JJ better/NN if/IN you/PRP a/DT )/NN cooked/VBD several/JJ batches/NNS a/DT day/NN or/CC b/NN )/NN just/RB left/IN it/PRP room/VBP temperature/NN and/CC honest/NN ./.
Microwaving/VBG your/JJ food/NN is/VBZ flat-out/JJ insulting/VBG to/TO your/PRP$ business/NN and/CC your/PRP$ customers/NNS ./.
I/PRP thoroughly/RB enjoyed/VBD both/DT of/IN my/PRP$ meals/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB step/VB in/IN that/DT cake/NN again/RB ./.
Really/RB disgusting/VBG bullshit/NN !/.
Get/NNP it/PRP together/RB !/.
Beyond/NNP that/IN ,/, everything/NN else/RB tasted/VBD fantastic/JJ (/NN thus/RB the/DT 4/NN stars/NNS )/VBP !/.
I/PRP simply/VBP detest/JJ eggs/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP order/VBP my/JJ meals/NNS without/IN ./.
Yesterday/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD the/DT ``/`` Mexican/NNP skillet/NN ''/'' and/CC ,/, boy/JJ howdy/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD great/JJ !/.
The/DT chorizo/NN and/CC salsa/NN were/VBD an/DT awesome/JJ compliment/NN to/TO the/DT already/RB phenomenal/JJ potatoes/NNS ./.
I/PRP see/VBP myself/JJ having/NN this/DT same/JJ dish/JJ again/NN quite/RB soon/RB ./.
Today/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD the/DT country/NN fried/VBD steak/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD ,/, honestly/RB ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/VBN ./.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD tender/JJ and/CC juicy/NN and/CC the/DT breading/NN was/VBD crisp/NN and/CC well-seasoned/JJ ./.
Really/RB ,/, really/RB good/JJ stuff/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD also/RB be/VB having/VBG it/PRP again/RB soon/RB ./.
My/NNP wife/NN had/VBD the/DT biscuits/NNS and/CC gravy/NN ,/, which/WDT she/PRP said/VBD was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB quite/VB the/DT way/NN she/PRP likes/VBZ them/PRP ./.
Then/RB again/RB ,/, she/PRP apparently/RB had/VBD that/IN particular/JJ bar/NN set/NN quite/RB high/JJ when/WRB she/PRP was/VBD younger/JJR ./.
She/PRP also/RB had/VBD the/DT huevos/NNS rancheros/NNS ,/, which/WDT she/PRP said/VBD was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
Also/RB ,/, both/DT days/NNS ,/, the/DT staff/NN was/VBD quite/JJ friendly/RB and/CC helpful/JJ ,/, though/IN I/PRP do/VBP wish/JJ people/servers/NNS would/MD understand/VB that/IN ``/`` water/NN ''/'' does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB ``/`` water/NN with/IN lemon/NN ''/'' ./.
I/PRP know/VBP this/DT is/VBZ apparently/RB standard/JJ practice/NN at/IN many/JJ restaurants/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP personally/RB think/VBP that/DT ,/, if/IN someone/NN orders/NNS just/RB ``/`` water/NN ''/'' ,/, you/PRP should/MD probably/RB ask/VB if/IN they/PRP want/VBP a/DT strong-flavored/JJ fruit/NN wedge/VB submerged/VBN in/IN it/PRP before/IN just/RB automatically/RB adding/VBG it/PRP ./.
Maybe/NNP that/NNP 's/POS just/RB us/PRP ,/, but/CC much/RB like/IN with/IN every/DT other/JJ single/JJ aspect/NN of/IN my/PRP$ dining/NN experiences/NNS ,/, If/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB specifically/RB ask/VB for/IN something/NN ,/, I/PRP DO/VBP NOT/NNP want/NNP it/PRP ./.
Simple/NNP enough/NNP ?/.
With/IN all/DT of/IN that/DT being/NNP said/VBD ,/, there/EX really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB any/DT question/NN about/IN us/PRP being/VBG repeat/NN customers/NNS here/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP some/DT problems/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB friendly/RB and/CC most/JJS of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB phenomenal/JJ ./.

The/DT side/NN of/IN crispy/NN nuggets/NNS of/IN seasoned/VBN potato/NN cubes/NNS rounded/VBD it/PRP out/IN ./.
Conclusion/NN :/: If/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB for/IN the/DT red/VBN velvet/NN pancakes/NNS up/IN the/DT street/NN ,/, Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB !/.

We/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN going/VBG to/TO this/DT location/NN of/IN the/DT Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP sporadically/RB for/IN nearly/RB 10/CD years/NNS now/RB ./.
I/PRP started/VBD off/RP always/RB having/VBG their/PRP$ solid/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC turkey/NN sausage/NN plate/NN ,/, but/CC now/RB that/IN my/PRP$ diet/NN is/VBZ more/RBR plant/JJ strong/JJ these/DT days/NNS ,/, this/DT time/NN I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT Veggie/NNP Skillet/NNP -/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP sooooo/JJ glad/NN I/PRP did/VBD !/.
Fresh/NNP broccoli/NNP ,/, mushrooms/NNS and/CC spinach/VB sauteed/JJ and/CC served/VBD over/IN the/DT Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP 's/POS signature/NN seasoned/VBD potatoes/NNS -/JJ topped/VBN with/IN two/CD eggs/NNS over/IN easy/JJ ./.

One/CD thing/NN I/PRP was/VBD happy/JJ to/TO see/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT wait/NN was/VBD much/RB shorter/JJR than/IN I/PRP remember/VBP for/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP -/NN about/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP a/DT feeling/NN that/WDT 's/VBZ due/JJ to/TO more/JJR breakfast/NN options/NNS opening/VBG in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
We/PRP tried/VBD to/TO go/VB to/TO Babycakes/NNS but/CC they/PRP had/VBD an/DT hour/NN and/CC fifteen/VBN minute/JJ wait/NN !/.
Bad/NNP for/IN fans/NNS of/IN Babycakes/NNP ,/, good/JJ for/IN fans/NNS of/IN the/DT Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP !/.
The/DT egg-themed/JJ breakfast/NN joints/NNS in/IN Vegas/NNP tend/NN to/TO blend/VB together/RB after/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, and/CC while/IN the/DT Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ nothing/NN terribly/RB distinctive/JJ about/IN it/PRP either/-NONE- ./.
We/PRP came/VBD on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP morning/NN about/IN 10/CD a.m./NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD prime/JJ time/NN ,/, but/CC despite/IN that/DT ,/, we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN within/IN five/CD minutes/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, with/IN someone/NN taking/VBG our/NN drink/NN orders/NNS right/RB away/RB and/CC the/DT waitress/NN following/VBG up/RP soon/RB thereafter/JJR ./.

You/PRP 'll/VBD read/NN about/IN this/DT coffee/NN cake/NN in/IN other/JJ Yelpers/NNS '/POS reviews/NNS ,/, and/CC with/IN good/JJ reason/NN :/: It/PRP 's/VBZ warm/NN ,/, soft/RB ,/, slightly/RB gooey/NN ,/, and/CC positively/RB designed/VBN to/TO make/VB you/PRP crave/VB coffee/NN ,/, as/IN good/JJ coffee/NN cake/NN should/MD ./.
The/DT rest/NN of/IN our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD made/VBN perfectly/RB to/TO order/NN ,/, and/CC while/IN not/RB the/DT greatest/JJS food/NN ever/RB ,/, definitely/RB solid/JJ ./.
The/DT seasoned/VBN potatoes/NNS could/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT bit/JJ more/RBR seasoned/JJ ,/, but/CC then/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP compare/VBP all/DT to/TO the/DT Egg/NNP &/CC I/NNP 's/POS potatoes/NNS ,/, so/RB .../RB sorry/JJ ,/, Cracked/JJ Egg/NNP ./.
;/: )/NNP Our/NNP water/NN and/CC coffee/NN were/VBD kept/VBN filled/JJ and/CC our/PRP$ check/NN came/VBD promptly/RB ./.
Because/IN I/PRP live/VBP on/IN the/DT opposite/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT valley/NN from/IN the/DT Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP ,/, I/PRP probably/RB would/MD n't/RB seek/VB it/PRP out/IN again/RB (/NN as/IN other/JJ comparable/JJ venues/NNS such/JJ as/IN Eggworks/NNS are/VBP closer/JJR )/NNS ,/, but/CC if/IN I/PRP was/VBD in/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN one/CD morning/NN ?/.

I/PRP had/VBD breakfast/VBN here/RB today/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB pleased/VBN with/IN everything/NN ./.

The/DT wait/NN to/TO be/VB seated/VBN was/VBD said/VBN at/IN 15-20/CD minutes/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD about/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS I/PRP 'd/MD say/VB ./.
But/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT raspberry/JJ French/JJ toast/NN and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN sausage/NN links/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD very/RB delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB seen/VBN where/WRB someone/NN took/VBD French/JJ toast/NN and/CC between/IN the/DT bread/NN is/VBZ like/IN a/DT raspberry/JJ jam/NN or/CC filling/NN ./.

Came/NN to/TO around/VB 14/CD $/$ for/IN the/DT meal/NN not/RB including/VBG the/DT tip/NN so/RB to/TO me/PRP was/VBD worth/JJ it/PRP ./.

I/PRP guess/VBP for/IN the/DT high/JJ dollar/NN amount/NN for/IN this/DT meal/NN ,/, Dennys/NNP is/VBZ a/DT better/JJ option/NN ./.
We/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN at/IN other/JJ Cracked/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC have/VBP never/RB walked/VBN away/RB unhappy/JJ ./.

This/DT was/VBD the/DT most/RBS unique/JJ and/CC best/JJ tasting/VBG breakfast/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN a/DT long/JJ ,/, long/JJ time/NN ./.

:/: )/.
First/NNP ,/, let/NNP me/NNP say/VB the/DT menu/NN --/: wow/NN !/.
Plenty/NN of/IN variety/NN for/IN breakfast/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP eggs/NNS ,/, turkey/NN sausage/NN ,/, fruit/JJ instead/NN of/IN potatoes/NNS ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN the/DT homemade/NN coffee/NN cake/NN in/IN a/DT to-go/NN box/NN and/CC toted/VBD it/PRP to/TO a/DT colleague/NN who/WP loves/NNS it/PRP ./.

Cracked/NNP Egg/NNP ./.

You/PRP can/MD opt/VB for/IN either/DT toast/NN or/CC hot/NN coffee/NN cake/NN ./.

The/DT pancakes/NNS are/VBP nice/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ without/IN the/DT pasty/NN feel/NN and/CC floury/JJ taste/NN you/PRP get/VB at/IN other/JJ places/NNS ./.

Maybe/NNP it/PRP just/RB seemed/VBD that/IN way/NN because/IN no/DT one/NN was/VBD eating/VBG outside/RB because/IN it/PRP was/VBD RAINING/NNP !/.

Now/RB that/DT 's/VBZ tropical/JJ !/.
I/PRP would/MD even/RB add/VB another/DT half/NN star/NN to/TO this/DT ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB give/VB it/PRP 5/-NONE- stars/VBZ only/RB because/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB breakfast/JJ should/NNS cost/VBD $/$ 12.00/CD ./.

Up/NNP popped/VBD Cracked/VBN Egg/NNP ./.
