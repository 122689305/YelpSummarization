I/PRP really/VBP wanted/JJ to/TO like/IN Muncheeze/NNP truck/NN because/IN I/PRP love/VBP ,/, love/JJ ,/, love/JJ cheese/NN !/.

I/PRP guess/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ gotten/VBN a/DT lot/NN more/RBR popular/JJ since/IN I/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT first/JJ couple/NN times/NNS ./.
The/DT Muncheeze/NNP truck/NN line/NN was/VBD long/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP figured/VBD ,/, hey/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT food/NN truck/NN ,/, they/PRP serve/VBP out/RP the/DT food/NN pretty/RB fast/JJ ./.
I/PRP waited/VBD in/IN a/DT long/JJ line/NN at/IN Lulu/NNP 's/POS before/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT wait/NN was/VBD n't/RB too/RB bad/JJ ./.

The/DT food/NN did/VBD not/RB make/VB me/PRP happy/VB either/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB got/VBD the/DT buffalo/NN cheese/NN curds/NNS ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN the/DT guys/NNS that/WDT started/-NONE- this/DT food/NN truck/NN only/RB did/VBD it/PRP to/TO find/VB a/DT place/NN to/TO hang/VB out/RP together/RB and/CC play/NN annoying/VBG gangster/NN rap/NN music/JJ ./.
While/IN I/PRP was/VBD here/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD reminded/VBN of/IN not/RB only/RB the/DT Dad/NNP 's/POS Grilled/NNP Cheese/NNP business/NN in/IN town/NN that/IN failed/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT show/NN ``/`` America/NNP 's/POS Next/NNP Great/NNP Restaurant/NNP ,/, ''/'' where/WRB there/EX was/VBD a/DT contestant/NN who/WP also/RB had/VBD a/DT grilled/VBN cheese/NN restaurant/NN idea/NN that/WDT was/VBD eliminated/VBN because/IN there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN really/RB original/JJ or/CC unique/JJ about/IN what/WP he/PRP was/VBD doing/VBG ./.
Regardless/NNP ,/, both/DT Dad/NNP 's/POS Grilled/NNP Cheese/NNP and/CC the/DT contestant/NN on/IN TV/NN do/NNS grilled/VBD cheese/NN sandwiches/NNS better/JJR than/IN the/DT Muncheeze/NNP truck/NN ./.
Hell/NNP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP an/DT infinitely/RB better/JJ job/NN at/IN a/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN than/IN they/PRP do/VBP ./.
Okay/NNP On/VBD to/TO the/DT food/NN ./.
Basically/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO excuse/VB a/DT place/NN that/WDT supposedly/RB specializes/VBZ in/IN grilled/JJ cheese/NN sandwiches/NNS when/WRB they/PRP ca/VBP n't/RB even/RB melt/VB the/DT cheese/NN ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, both/DT sandwiches/NNS that/WDT were/VBD ordered/VBN had/VBD no/DT melted/VBN cheese/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD just/RB a/DT little/JJ warmed/VBN up/RP ./.
And/CC there/EX was/VBD so/RB little/RB of/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT bread/JJ (/NN they/PRP only/RB offer/VBP basic/JJ white/JJ and/CC wheat/JJ )/NN is/VBZ also/RB pretty/RB flimsy/JJ ./.
Can/NNP I/PRP also/RB mention/NN that/IN they/PRP served/VBD stale/JJ potato/NN chips/NNS with/IN these/DT ?/.
The/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN bites/NNS were/VBD the/DT neon/JJ orange/NN mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN straight/VBD out/RP of/IN the/DT kraft/NN box/NN ./.
At/IN least/JJS take/VB the/DT time/NN to/TO make/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN from/IN scratch/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT soups/NNS -/JJ they/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN lobster/NN bisque/NN but/CC I/PRP question/VBP their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT quality/NN soup/NN after/IN tasting/VBG the/DT tomato/NN soup/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD worse/JJR than/IN a/DT canned/VBN campbell/NN 's/POS soup/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD like/IN they/PRP bought/VBP it/PRP bulk/NN from/IN the/DT Cash/NNP and/CC Carry/Smart/NNP and/CC Final/NNP store/NN and/CC served/VBD it/PRP up/RB ./.
And/CC the/DT bread/JJ bowls/NNS they/PRP served/VBD it/PRP in/IN were/VBD cold/NN and/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT incentive/NN to/TO eat/VB the/DT bread/JJ after/NN attempting/VBG to/TO finish/VB the/DT soup/NN ./.
Anyone/NNP that/IN yelped/JJ liked/VBD the/DT soup/NN must/MD never/RB get/VB to/TO eat/VB homemade/NN ,/, from/IN scratch/NN tomato/NN soup/NN and/CC knows/VBZ what/WP it/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN ./.
I/PRP just/RB ca/VBP n't/RB believe/VB how/WRB incredibly/RB lazy/VB the/DT people/NNS that/WDT run/-NONE- this/DT truck/NN are/VBP and/CC how/WRB they/PRP have/VBP the/DT gall/NN to/TO call/VB this/DT actual/JJ food/NN and/CC serve/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT only/JJ way/NN I/PRP would/MD ever/RB eat/VB this/DT food/NN again/NN is/VBZ if/IN I/PRP was/VBD homeless/JJ ,/, but/CC even/RB then/RB with/IN the/DT insanely/RB high/JJ prices/NNS they/PRP are/VBP charging/VBG for/IN this/DT crap/NN ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD never/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO afford/VB it/PRP ./.
Despite/IN some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ facebook/NN reviews/VBZ on/IN the/DT day/NN of/IN vegas/NNS streets/NNS ,/, i/NNP think/NNP Muncheeze/NNP is/VBZ delish/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.

YUMMMM/NNP .../: We/PRP took/VBD everything/NN to-go/NN ,/, the/DT Piggy/NNP Mac/NNP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ ,/, it/PRP reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN the/DT Pulled/NNP Porky/NNP Slider../NNP

****This/NNP review/NN is/VBZ only/RB for/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, since/IN it/PRP was/VBD so/RB bad/JJ and/CC we/PRP waited/VBD so/RB long/RB that/IN we/PRP canceled/VBD our/PRP$ order/NN ,/, and/CC 5/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ they/PRP bring/VBD out/IN the/DT order/NN anyway/NN while/IN we/PRP wait/VBP to/TO speak/NN to/TO the/DT manager****/NN So/RB before/IN the/DT Gazillionaire/NNP Elite/NNP Event/NNP at/IN Caeser/NNP 's/POS my/NN friend/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO go/VB to/TO Muncheeze/NNP for/IN a/DT quick/JJ bite/NN due/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ time/NN constraints/NNS ./.
I/PRP personally/RB think/VBP and/CC hour/NN at/IN a/DT casual/JJ dinning/NN establishment/NN is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN enough/JJ time/NN to/TO sit/VB ,/, eat/NN ,/, pay/VB the/DT bill/NN and/CC leave/NN but/CC I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG the/DT wrong/JJ thing/NN in/IN this/DT instance/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN by/IN the/DT hostess/NN and/CC seated/VBN quickly/RB ./.
As/IN we/PRP arrived/VBD we/PRP sat/VBP next/JJ to/TO a/DT couple/NN who/WP had/VBD just/RB sat/JJ down/IN and/CC ordered/NN ,/, the/DT waitress/NN then/RB took/VBD our/PRP$ drink/NN order/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN and/CC I/PRP asked/VBD that/IN a/DT TV/NN be/VB put/VBN on/IN a/DT specific/JJ game/NN ./.
We/PRP order/VBP our/PRP$ drinks/NNS and/CC she/PRP gives/VBZ us/PRP a/DT minute/NN to/TO look/NN at/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
5/IN minutes/NNS later/VBP the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP gets/VBZ their/PRP$ drinks/NNS and/CC she/PRP takes/VBZ our/JJ order/NN ./.

and/CC the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP gets/VBZ their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
15/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP is/VBZ done/VBN eating/JJ and/CC are/VBP given/VBN their/PRP$ check/NN (/NNS now/RB in/IN most/JJS cases/NNS the/DT server/NN would/MD see/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP right/RB next/JJ to/TO them/PRP and/CC we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB any/DT food/NN AND/IN the/DT TV/NN that/IN I/PRP asked/VBD to/TO be/VB changed/VBN was/VBD never/RB changed/VBN )/NN another/DT 15/NN minutes/VBZ passes/NNS as/IN we/PRP watch/VBP them/PRP pay/VB leave/NN and/CC their/PRP$ table/JJ is/VBZ bussed/VBN before/IN the/DT server/NN comes/VBZ back/RB and/CC says/VBZ ``/`` you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB your/VBN food/NN yet/RB ?/VBN !/NN ?/. ''/''
in/IN which/WDT I/PRP answered/VBD ``/`` no/DT ,/, and/CC actually/RB I/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB somewhere/RB at/IN 8pm/CD ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO cancel/NN our/NN order/NN ./. ''/''

Now/RB since/IN I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO an/DT event/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO have/VB to/TO carry/VB this/DT stuff/NN across/IN the/DT Casino/NNP and/CC then/RB have/VB to/TO eat/VB it/PRP while/IN at/IN the/DT event/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP declined/VBD and/CC asked/VBD to/TO speak/NN to/TO the/DT manager/NN ./.
Before/NNP the/DT manager/NN comes/VBZ out/RP the/DT table/JJ the/DT food/NN comes/NN ./.
Now/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP even/RB more/RBR irritated/JJ ./.
We/PRP have/VBP already/RB cancelled/VBN the/DT food/NN ,/, obviously/RB we/PRP were/VBD hungry/JJ otherwise/JJ we/PRP would/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN there/RB ,/, but/CC to/TO not/RB have/VB enough/RB common/JJ courtesy/NN to/TO not/RB put/VB the/DT food/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN me/NN that/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB eat/VB now/RB because/IN I/PRP have/VBP no/DT time/NN to/TO so/RB would/MD be/VB great.The/JJ manager/NN seemed/VBD friendly/RB enough/RB though/IN about/IN the/DT situation/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB sorry/JJ for/IN the/DT incident/NN but/CC the/DT damage/NN had/VBD been/VBN done/VBN ./.
He/PRP offered/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT tab/NN next/JJ time/NN we/PRP stop/VBP by/IN but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ if/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO do/VB that/IN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP lost/VBD me/PRP at/IN the/DT 45/CD minute/JJ wait/NN ./.
I/PRP SOSOSOSO/VBP want/JJ to/TO give/VB this/DT a/DT better/JJR review/NN and/CC hopefully/RB it/PRP will/MD change/VB ./.
Grilled/NNP cheese/NN is/was/VBZ my/PRP$ favorite/JJ comfort/NN food/NN as/IN a/DT child/NN and/CC now/RB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD also/RB recently/RB spoiled/VBN to/TO have/VB a/DT visit/NN Roxy/NNP 's/POS Grilled/NNP cheese/NN truck/NN from/IN Boston/NNP visit/NN Vegas/NNP so/IN I/PRP got/VBD a/DT chance/NN to/TO compare/VB to/TO what/VB a/DT true/JJ grilled/JJ cheese/NN truck/NN should/MD offer/VB ./.
(/IN I/PRP wrote/VBD a/DT review/NN for/IN them/PRP in/IN another/DT entry/NN )/NN Anyways/NNS Grilled/VBD cheese/NN musts/NNS .../: ..are/JJ CHEESE/NNP !/.
GOOEY/NNP Cheese/NNP ,/, Hot/NNP and/CC not/RB Burnt/VB ./.
Well/NNP thankfully/RB this/DT sandwich/NN was/VBD not/RB burnt/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT 3/NN cheese/NN with/IN bacon/NN for/IN $/$ 5/CD ./.
It/PRP came/VBD on/IN standard/JJ white/JJ bread/NN ./.
The/DT cheese/NN inside/NN was/VBD partly/RB melted/VBN but/CC not/RB all/PDT the/DT way/NN ./.
The/DT Mac/NNP bites/VBZ on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN $/$ 3/CD and/CC 6/CD of/IN them/PRP was/VBD excellent/JJ !/.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN with/IN Holla-Peno/NNP Ketchup/NNP and/CC was/VBD well/RB worth/IN the/DT $/$ 3/CD ./.
Muncheese/NNP is/VBZ the/DT sister/NN truck/NN to/TO Slidin/NNP Thru/NNP and/CC I/PRP know/VBP they/PRP start/VBP making/VBG some/DT kickass/NNS grilled/VBD cheese/NN after/IN they/PRP start/VBP looking/VBG at/IN the/DT product/NN better/NN at/IN the/DT lab/NN ./.
My/NNP only/RB suggestion/NN is/VBZ using/VBG a/DT thicker/NN bread/NN like/IN a/DT Brioche/NNP or/CC Texas/NNP toast/NN and/CC unique/JJ cheeses/NNS like/IN Brie/NNP ,/, Maytag/NNP Bleu/NNP and/CC Muenster/NNP ./.
At/IN least/JJS add/JJ thicker/NN cheese/NN and/CC make/VB sure/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ gooey/stringy/JJ when/WRB pulled/JJ apart/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD keep/VB visiting/NN and/CC I/PRP love/VB the/DT concept/NN and/CC will/MD change/VB the/DT rating/NN as/IN I/PRP know/VBP you/PRP will/MD get/VB better/RBR ,/,
This/DT is/VBZ good/JJ stuff/NN no/DT doubt/NN ./.
Same/NNP guys/VBZ as/IN Slidn/NN Thru/NNP so/IN you/PRP know/VBP the/DT service/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN will/MD be/VB original/JJ and/CC BOMB/NNP !/.
!/NN
I/PRP was/VBD so/RB excited/VBN to/TO try/VB out/RP the/DT eats/NNS from/IN here/RB ./.
And/CC I/PRP finally/RB got/VBD the/DT opportunity/NN at/IN the/DT last/JJ StrEATS/NNP ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB off/RP to/TO a/DT great/JJ start/NN ./.
Glitches/NNS prevented/VBD them/PRP from/IN opening/NN on/IN time/NN and/CC left/VBD a/DT few/JJ of/IN us/PRP waiting/VBG in/IN line/NN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN salivating/VBG and/CC exercising/VBG our/PRP$ patience/NN ./.
But/CC hey/NN ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP a/DT newbie/NN truck/NN ,/, so/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO cut/VB them/PRP a/DT little/JJ slack/NN ./.
The/DT lobster/NN bisque/NN (/IN one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ soup/JJ offerings/NNS )/NN was/VBD absolutely/RB fantastic/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD served/VBN in/IN a/DT bread/JJ bowl/NN and/CC filled/VBD with/IN all/DT kinds/NNS of/IN yummy/NN ./.
Temps/NNP outside/NNP may/MD be/VB rising/VBG ,/, but/CC do/VBP n't/RB pass/VB up/RP this/DT tasty/NN delight/NN ./.
For/IN a/DT sandwich/JJ ,/, I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT one/CD with/IN the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN and/CC mac/NN 'n/NNS '/POS cheese/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB great/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD missing/VBG the/DT ooey/NN gooey/NN cheese/NN ./.
But/CC props/NNS for/IN an/DT interesting/JJ combination/NN ./.
All/IN the/DT sandwiches/NNS come/VBP with/IN fries/NNS and/CC a/DT dipping/JJ sauce/NN (/NNS like/IN ketchup/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB )/RB ./.
Hint/NN :/: try/NN dipping/VBG your/NN grilled/VBD cheese/NN in/IN the/DT dipping/JJ sauce/NN ./.
My/NNP main/NNP complaint/NN was/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN ./.
Especially/RB in/IN a/DT setting/NN with/IN so/RB much/JJ food/NN goodness/NN (/NN in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, so/RB many/JJ eats/NNS I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO sample/JJ )/NN ,/, the/DT amount/NN of/IN food/NN was/VBD overwhelming/VBG ./.
It/PRP was/VBD also/RB awkward/JJ trying/VBG to/TO balance/NN everything/NN and/CC eat/NN so/RB much/JJ while/IN standing/NN up/IN ./.
The/DT portions/NNS and/CC packaging/NN did/VBD n't/RB quite/VB lend/NN itself/NNS to/TO street/JJ food/NN ./.
Offering/IN half/DT sandwiches/NNS and/CC fries/NNS as/IN an/DT optional/JJ (/NN not/RB automatic/JJ )/NN side/NN would/MD be/VB nice/RB ./.
The/DT concept/NN of/IN this/DT truck/NN is/VBZ awesome/NN ./.
The/DT execution/NN still/RB needs/VBZ a/DT little/JJ work/NN though/IN ./.
I/PRP appreciate/VBP the/DT trendy/NN food/NN truck/NN craze/NN that/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB overtaking/VBG every/DT major/JJ city/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ awesome/JJ ./.
Muncheeze/NNP menu/NN is/VBZ outstanding/JJ ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ something/NN for/IN everyone/NN ./.
You/PRP have/VBP the/DT grilled/VBN cheese/NN that/IN includes/JJ pulled/JJ pork/NN and/CC mac/NN n/NNS '/POS cheese/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT one/CD that/NN has/VBZ steak/JJ ,/, or/CC the/DT classic/JJ ham/NN &/CC cheese/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT combination/NN of/IN cheeses/NNS and/CC bacon/NN ./.
Everything/NN in/IN that/DT last/JJ sentence/NN flows/VBZ so/RB beautifully/RB ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT cheese/NN enthusiast/NN ,/, so/RB if/IN there/EX is/VBZ cheese/NN on/IN something/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP usually/RB gettin/VBN down/RP with/IN the/DT get/NN down/IN ./.
Unfortunately/RB where/WRB Muncheeze/NNP falls/VBZ short/JJ is/VBZ the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
Unlike/IN their/PRP$ sister/NN truck/NN Slidin/NNP Thru/NNP ,/, they/PRP miss/VBP on/IN a/DT few/JJ key/JJ points/NNS ./.
If/IN I/PRP order/VBP a/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN ,/, there/EX better/VBZ be/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN cheese/NN on/IN there/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP order/VBP your/JJ grilled/JJ cheese/NN that/WDT includes/VBZ 3/RB different/JJ types/NNS of/IN cheese/NN ,/, THERE/NNP BETTER/NNP BE/NNP A/DT LOT/NNP OF/NNP CHEESE/NNP ./.
That/DT was/VBD not/RB the/DT case/NN when/WRB I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Cheesy/NNP Lovers/NNP Delight/NNP (/NNP I/PRP selected/VBD American/JJ ,/, Cheddar/NNP ,/, and/CC Mozerella/NNP )/NNP ./.
The/DT cheese/NN was/VBD barely/RB noticeable/JJ ,/, that/DT was/VBD disappointing/VBG ./.
If/IN it/PRP had/VBD more/RBR cheese/JJ it/PRP would/MD have/VB changed/VBN my/PRP$ whole/JJ experience/NN ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT combo/NN meal/NN ,/, appropriately/RB named/VBD the/DT Munchbox/NNP Combo/NNP which/WDT included/VBD a/DT tasty/NN glass/NN Coca-Cola/NNP and/CC Mac-Bites/NNP featuring/VBG Holla-peno/NNP ketchup/NN ./.
The/DT Mac/NNP Bites/NNP were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ greasy/NN and/CC lacked/VBD a/DT real/JJ cheesy/NN flavor/NN ,/, so/RB those/DT fell/VBD short/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
Another/DT disappointment/NN was/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN Lobster/NNP Bisque/NNP ,/, or/CC ,/, they/PRP never/RB really/RB had/VBD any/DT since/IN we/PRP got/VBD to/TO the/DT truck/NN 20/CD minutes/NNS after/IN the/DT windows/NNS opened/VBD ./.
At/IN first/JJ they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB sure/JJ if/IN they/PRP had/VBD Mac/NNP Bites/NNP as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT organization/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ all/NN over/IN the/DT place/NN this/DT time/NN around/IN ./.
With/IN the/DT awesomeness/NN of/IN Slidin/NNP Thru/NNP I/PRP definitely/RB had/VBD high/JJ expectations/NNS for/IN Muncheeze/NNP ./.
Unfortunately/RB they/PRP fell/VBD short/JJ ./.
Knowing/VBG that/IN they/PRP are/VBP run/VBN by/IN the/DT iconic/JJ slider/NN truck/NN I/PRP will/MD give/VB them/PRP a/DT second/JJ chance/NN ./.
