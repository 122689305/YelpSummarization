So/RB in/IN Scarborough/NNP you/PRP 're/VBP pretty/RB limited/VBN to/TO restaurant/VB chains/NNS and/CC sometimes/RB mediocre/VB service/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO a/DT few/JJ Moxie/NNP 's/POS locations/NNS (/VBP Richmond/NNP Hill/NNP ,/, Fairview/NNP ,/, etc/NN ./. )/''
and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB have/VB a/DT preference/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ forgettable/JJ at/IN best/JJS and/CC the/DT girls/NNS can/MD be/VB sometimes/RB standoffish/JJ ./.
I/PRP find/VBP that/IN the/DT guy/JJ servers/NNS are/VBP usually/RB more/RBR attentive/JJ -/JJ they/PRP 'll/VBP usually/RB pack/VB up/RP my/PRP$ meal/NN in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN instead/NN of/IN just/RB handing/VBG me/PRP an/DT empty/NN takeout/NN box/NN like/IN the/DT the/DT female/JJ servers/NNS will/MD do/VB ./.
The/DT male/NN servers/VBZ tend/NN to/TO be/VB more/JJR attentive/JJ and/CC outgoing/JJ ,/, whereas/VBZ the/DT girls/NNS tend/VBP to/TO do/VB the/DT bare/NN minimum/NN in/IN checking/VBG up/RP on/IN the/DT table/JJ ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, if/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP looking/VBG for/IN reliable/JJ food/NN with/IN good/JJ ambiance/NN ,/, Moxie/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ a/DT safe/JJ bet/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP also/RB a/DT sucker/NN for/IN their/PRP$ bellinis/NN and/CC white/JJ chocolate/NN brownies/NNS ./.
Been/NNP here/RB many/JJ times/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.
Every/NNP time/NN I/PRP visit/VBD the/DT food/NN I/PRP order/VBP as/IN a/DT main/entree/NN is/VBZ always/RB a/DT disappointment/NN ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP too/RB high/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP absolutely/RB love/JJ is/VBZ the/DT dessert/NN ./.
The/DT tasting/VBG trio/NN is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
The/DT recent/JJ increase/NN in/IN prices/NNS is/VBZ a/DT disappointment/NN as/IN the/DT portions/NNS remain/VBP the/DT same/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD only/RB go/VB for/IN the/DT dessert/NN ./.
Came/NN here/RB for/IN dinner/NN a/DT few/JJ nights/NNS ago/IN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ at/IN first/JJ ,/, but/CC got/VBD better/RBR later/JJ ./.
My/NNP burger/NN was/VBD decent/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB worth/VB the/DT price/NN ;/: I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN better/VBN burgers/NNS at/IN restaurants/NNS for/IN less/JJR than/IN $/$ 16/CD ./.
Furthermore/NNP ,/, my/NNP buddy/NN 's/POS steak/NN was/VBD mediocre/RB ./.
Since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ overpriced/VBN ,/, I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB visiting/VBG again/RB ./.
Ordered/NNP wine/NN and/CC in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT glasses/NNS there/EX was/VBD stuff/JJ in/IN it/PRP ./.
According/VBG to/TO the/DT waitress/NN after/IN 10/CD min/NN it/PRP was/VBD ``/`` just/RB ''/'' cork/NN but/CC no/DT replacement/NN was/VBD given/VBN and/CC the/DT glass/NN did/VBD n't/RB come/VB back/RB .../: Not/NN that/IN we/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO drink/VB it/PRP !/-NONE- !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD super/JJ slow/JJ ,/, never/RB in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN did/VBD I/PRP get/VB such/JJ slow/JJ service/NN ./.
To/TO bring/NN over/IN drinks/NNS apparently/RB takes/VBP around/IN half/DT hour/NN +/NN ./.
We/PRP WOULD/VBP have/VBP ordered/VBN snacks/NNS but/CC we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO catch/NN a/DT movie/NN and/CC did/VBD n't/RB expect/VB things/NNS to/TO be/VB so/RB slow/RB ./.
We/PRP tipped/VBD 30/CD %/NN hopefully/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT difference/NN .../: It/PRP did/VBD not/RB lol/VB ./.
Well/NNP I/PRP would/MD n't/RB have/VB tipped/VBN 30/CD %/NN personally/RB but/CC my/RB friend/NN wanted/VBD to/TO ./.
Not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
Not/RB to/TO mention/NN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB even/RB busy/VB !/NNS !/IN !/.

I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO other/JJ locations/NNS and/CC none/NN were/VBD at/IN this/DT standard/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD there/RB for/IN a/DT nice/JJ Sunday/NNP dinner/NN today/NN ./.
Had/NNP a/DT good/JJ experience/NN at/IN the/DT Moxies/NNPS in/IN East/NNP Beaver/NNP Creek/NNP area/VBD a/DT year/NN ago/IN so/IN we/PRP were/VBD open/JJ to/TO it/PRP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN promptly/RB and/CC our/PRP$ server/NN introduced/NN herself/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ordered/VBD the/DT Blackened/VBN Chicken/NNP Sandwich/NNP with/IN side/NNP Caesar/NNP Salad/NNP ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Beef/NNP Burger/NNP ,/, no/DT cheese/NN ,/, gluten/VBN free/JJ bun/NN and/CC sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.
About/IN 15-20/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ another/DT server/NN brought/VBD over/IN a/DT sandwich/JJ board/NN with/IN two/CD burgers/NNS on/IN it/PRP ./.
One/CD regular/JJ burger/NN and/CC a/DT deluxe/NN burger/NN with/IN cheese/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP told/VBD the/DT server/NN that/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN ordered/VBD a/DT chicken/NN sandwich/NN and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT burger/NN with/IN no/DT cheese/NN and/CC a/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ bun/NN ./.
She/PRP took/VBD it/PRP away/RB and/CC I/PRP could/MD hear/VB her/PRP asking/VB in/IN a/DT loud/NN voice/NN where/WRB J/NNP --/: --/: -/JJ our/NN original/JJ server/NN was/VBD ./.
Then/RB our/VBD original/JJ server/NN brought/VBD over/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN 's/POS order/NN and/CC told/VBD me/PRP she/PRP was/VBD sorry/JJ but/CC there/EX was/VBD a/DT mixup/NN with/IN my/PRP$ order/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD on/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ way/NN ./.
I/PRP said/VBD okay/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB started/VBD the/DT timer/NN on/IN my/PRP$ phone/NN ./.
As/IN we/PRP waited/VBD the/DT Manager/NNP came/VBD over/IN to/TO apologize/VB and/CC explain/VB that/IN the/DT burger/NN was/VBD made/VBN with/IN cheese/NN by/IN mistake/NN ./.
I/PRP told/VBD him/PRP I/PRP also/RB asked/VBD for/IN a/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ bun/NN ./.
He/PRP asked/VBD if/IN I/PRP had/VBD an/DT allergy/NN and/CC I/PRP told/VBD him/PRP I/PRP did/VBD ./.
He/PRP explained/VBD there/RB were/VBD some/DT bits/NNS of/IN gluten/NN in/IN the/DT burger/NN ./.
I/PRP said/VBD that/IN was/VBD fine/RB ,/, as/IN my/JJ allergy/NN is/VBZ n't/RB severe/JJ ./.
He/PRP offered/VBD soup/NN or/CC salad/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP said/VBD no/DT ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB my/PRP$ meal/NN and/CC leave/VB some/DT room/NN for/IN desert/NN ./.
He/PRP went/VBD away/RB and/CC the/DT server/NN came/VBD back/RB and/CC offered/VBD her/PRP apologies/NNS ./.
She/PRP also/RB offered/VBD to/TO pay/NN for/IN the/DT desert/NN ./.
So/IN we/PRP waited/VBD and/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO tell/NN my/NNS pregnant/JJ wife/NN to/TO go/VB ahead/RB and/CC eat/VB without/JJ me/NN as/IN her/JJ food/NN would/MD have/VB gotten/VBN cold/NN ./.
The/DT server/NN came/VBD back/RB and/CC offered/VBD the/DT salad/JJ or/CC soup/JJ option/NN again/NN and/CC I/PRP then/RB decided/VBD to/TO have/VB the/DT Caesar/NNP salad/NN ./.
She/PRP brought/VBD that/IN over/IN and/CC I/PRP ate/VBP it/PRP ./.
Then/RB we/PRP waited/VBD and/CC waited/VBN and/CC by/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT server/NN actually/RB brought/VBD over/IN my/PRP$ burger/NN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN 13/VBN minutes..I/NN was/VBD going/VBG to/TO enjoy/VB it/PRP but/CC I/PRP like/VBP to/TO eat/VB my/PRP$ fries/NNS at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN and/CC since/IN the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD n't/RB ready/JJ I/PRP waited/VBD another/DT 3/NN minutes/VBZ until/IN the/DT fries/NNS arrived/VBD ./.
Then/RB as/IN I/PRP was/VBD about/IN to/TO eat/VB the/DT manager/NN came/VBD over/IN and/CC asked/VBD about/IN everything/NN ./.
I/PRP told/VBD him/PRP we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB happy/JJ as/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD a/DT nice/JJ meal/NN and/CC my/PRP$ meal/NN came/VBD 15/CD minutes/NNS after/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN 's/POS meal/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD being/VBG forced/VBN to/TO eat/VB separately/RB and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB enjoy/VB our/PRP$ experience/NN ./.
He/PRP apologized/VBD and/CC reiterated/VBD that/IN our/PRP$ desert/NN would/MD be/VB ``/`` taken/VBN care/NN of/IN ./. ''/''
I/PRP told/VBD him/PRP again/RB that/IN our/PRP$ experience/NN had/VBD been/VBN ruined/VBN and/CC if/IN we/PRP wanted/VBP this/DT type/NN of/IN service/NN we/PRP could/MD have/VB gotten/VBN fast/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP told/VBD him/PRP he/PRP needed/VBD to/TO pay/NN for/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
I/PRP saw/VBD that/IN he/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO offer/VB some/DT bull/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP even/RB said/VBD that/IN we/PRP were't/VBP even/RB drinking/VBG wine/NN ./.
He/PRP apologized/VBD again/RB and/CC offered/VBD us/PRP a/DT 'friends/NNS and/CC family/NN ''/'' discount/NN as/IN is/VBZ ``/`` customary/JJ ./. ''/''
All/IN the/DT while/NN smirking/NN as/IN if/IN he/PRP were/VBD pulling/VBG a/DT fast/NN one/CD on/IN us/PRP ./.
My/NNP wife/NN later/JJ told/NNS me/PRP she/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO ask/VB this/DT arrogant/NN schmuck/NN if/IN ``/`` We/PRP looked/VBD like/IN friends/NNS and/CC family/NN to/TO him/PRP ,/, because/IN we/PRP 're/VBP not/RB !/. ''/''
lol/NN ./.
After/IN he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB it/PRP ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB him/PRP if/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO email/VB the/DT owner/NN ./.
He/PRP promptly/RB changed/VBD his/PRP$ tune/NN and/CC apologized/VBD ./.
He/PRP then/RB said/VBD okay/NN to/TO get/VB this/DT right/NN we/PRP will/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN ``/`` both/DT ''/'' meals/NNS ?/.
I/PRP said/VBD yes/NNS ./.
Wow/NNP what/VBD a/DT douche..The/NN poor/JJ server/NN probably/NN was/VBD n't/RB trained/VBN right/NN and/CC had/VBD to/TO pay/NN for/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
We/PRP felt/VBD bad/JJ for/IN her/PRP as/IN she/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ ./.
This/DT douche/NN bag/NN manager/NN really/RB pissed/VBN me/PRP off/RP ./.
Oh/NNP yeah-our/JJ burgers/NNS were/VBD fine/RB ,/, nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN but/CC not/RB bad/RB by/IN any/DT means/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD tasty/JJ ,/, although/IN the/DT food/NN towards/NNS to/TO small/JJ portion/NN (/IN their/PRP$ steak/NN only/RB 7/CD oz/NN while/IN others/NNS usually/RB serving/VBG 10-12oz/JJ )/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB prefer/VBP quality/JJ rather/RB quantity/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBZ that/DT 's/VBZ their/PRP$ strategy/NN to/TO save/VB you/PRP room/VBP for/IN ordering/VBG appetizer/NN n/NN dessert/NN which/WDT mean/-NONE- able/VBD to/TO get/VB more/JJR money/NN out/IN from/IN your/PRP$ pocket/NN ./.
Suprise/NNP to/TO see/VB a/DT proper/NN healthy/JJ food/NN choice/NN from/IN kid/JJ menu/NN rather/RB then/RB all/DT junk/NN food/NN like/IN most/JJS other/JJ chain/NN restaurant/NN does/VBZ ./.
Parents/NNS ,/, if/IN you/PRP feel/VBP headache/JJ to/TO find/VB healthy/JJ choice/NN for/IN your/PRP$ lovely/RB kid/JJ while/IN dining/VBG out/RP ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT restaurant/NN that/IN you/PRP may/MD consider/VB ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ ,/, the/DT hostess/NN were/VBD welcoming/VBG n/JJ friendly/RB ./.
Our/NNP server/NN Daniel/NNP was/VBD professional/JJ n/JJ treated/VBN us/PRP well/RB ./.
For/IN a/DT fine/NN dining/VBG experience/NN with/IN an/DT affordable/JJ price/NN ./.
For/IN sure/NN will/MD come/VB back/RB ./.
Appetizers/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ,/, especially/RB the/DT calamari/NN ./.
Did/NNP n't/RB try/VB the/DT sushi/NN cones/VBZ or/CC the/DT bruschetta/NN but/CC they/PRP were/VBD both/DT finished/NNS with/IN no/DT complaints/NNS from/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, my/PRP$ chicken/NN chipotle/NN quesadilla/NN was/VBD very/RB dry/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD n't/RB much/JJ chicken/NN or/CC cheese/NN in/IN the/DT quesadilla/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN did/VBD n't/RB help/VB it/PRP go/VB down/IN any/DT better/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB remember/VB there/RB being/VBG any/DT chipotle/NN flavor/NN either/NN ./.
The/DT salad/NN had/VBD a/DT tad/JJ bit/NN too/RB much/JJ dressing/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN also/RB complained/VBD about/IN that/DT as/RB well/RB with/IN her/PRP$ salad/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN said/VBD his/PRP$ fish/JJ tacos/NNS were/VBD n't/RB that/IN great/JJ either/NN ./.
My/NNP other/JJ friend/NN got/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN and/CC lobster/NN linguine/NN and/CC the/DT lobster/NN tail/NN was/VBD miniscule/JJ ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, only/RB a/DT few/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS actually/RB enjoyed/VBD their/PRP$ main/JJ course/NN ./.
Probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/RB unless/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB for/IN drinks/NNS and/CC appetizers/NNS ./.
Soooo/NNP I/PRP work/VBP in/IN the/DT mall/NN and/CC ordered/VBD the/DT chicken/NN Alfredo/NNP penne/NN ./.
Picked/IN it/PRP up/RB and/CC came/VBD back/RP to/TO work/VB to/TO eat/VB it/PRP ,/, and/CC literally/RB there/RB were/VBD four/CD pieces/NNS if/IN chicken/NN in/IN it/PRP and/CC barely/RB any/DT sauce/NN ./.
Would/NNP have/VBP definitely/RB taken/VBN it/PRP back/RB if/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB at/IN work/NN ./.

Payed/NNP a/DT visit/NN after/IN watching/VBG a/DT late/JJ movie/NN on/IN St./NNP Party/NNP 's/POS day/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD very/RB busy/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD very/RB loud/JJ ;/: thus/RB service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD hard/JJ to/TO get/VB the/DT waiter/NN 's/POS attention/NN ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD forever/NN to/TO order/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ ,/, and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
My/NNP previous/VBD experiences/NNS at/IN various/JJ Moxies/NNS have/VBP been/VBN great/JJ ,/, the/DT servers/NNS are/VBP always/RB kind/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN has/VBZ been/VBN slightly/RB above/IN mediocre/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD excited/VBN to/TO eat/VB here/RB because/IN of/IN my/PRP$ past/NN experiences/NNS ,/, however/RB I/PRP noticed/VBD that/IN the/DT prices/NNS increased/VBD and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB even/RB worth/VB it/PRP ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT food/NN has/VBZ lots/NNS of/IN calories/NNS :/: between/IN 500-1000+/CD ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP shared/VBD a/DT nachos/JJ platter/NN and/CC calamari/NN ./.
The/DT nachos/NNS were/VBD decent/JJ ,/, until/IN you/PRP reach/VBP the/DT bottom/NN where/WRB you/PRP realize/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ swimming/VBG in/IN oil/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP made/VBN nachos/NNS at/IN home/NN ,/, and/CC never/RB have/VBP I/PRP created/VBP such/JJ a/DT disgusting/NN dish/NN ./.
The/DT calamari/NN was/VBD alright/RB ,/, not/RB worth/IN the/DT $/$ 14/CD at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB disappointed/JJ with/IN this/DT overpriced/VBN ,/, low-quality/JJ ,/, tasteless/JJ food/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP will/MD be/VB returning/VBG ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ okay/NN like/IN at/IN most/JJS Moxie/NNP ./.
I/PRP got/VBD an/DT appetizer/NN that/IN had/VBD seared/VBN rare/JJ tuna/NN on/IN a/DT cracker/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB done/VBN perfectly/RB (/IN which/WDT I/PRP 've/VBP expected/VBN )/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB good/JJ ./.
Then/RB I/PRP skipped/VBD straight/JJ to/TO the/DT dessert/NN tasting/VBG trio/NN ./.
The/DT cheesecake/NN was/VBD normal/JJ ,/, the/DT sticky/JJ toffee/NN pudding/VBG was/VBD too/RB hard/JJ and/CC the/DT brownie/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ ./.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP dessert/NN ,/, just/RB order/IN the/DT full/JJ size/NN white/JJ chocolate/NN brownie/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT service/NN .../:
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB bad/JJ ./.
Our/NNP waitress/NN could/MD not/RB be/VB found/VBN ./.
It/PRP got/VBD so/RB bad/JJ that/IN another/DT waiter/NN basically/RB took/VBD over/IN for/IN her/PRP ./.
It/PRP took/VBD forever/NN to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ ice/NN tea/NN refilled/VBD ,/, to/TO get/VB a/DT dessert/NN menu/NN ,/, to/TO place/VB our/PRP$ order/NN and/CC then/RB to/TO get/VB the/DT bill/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP what/WP you/PRP 're/VBP thinking/VBG ,/, it/PRP was/VBD probably/RB busy/JJ and/CC they/PRP 're/VBP just/RB overwhelmed/VBN ./.
No/DT ./.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD the/DT perfect/NN experience/NN at/IN this/DT Moxie/NNP so/RB this/DT experience/NN is/VBZ no/DT difference/NN from/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ time/NN at/IN this/DT location/NN and/CC not/RB a/DT very/RB pleasant/JJ experience/NN ./.
We/PRP have/VBP ordered/VBN the/DT sweet/JJ chilli/NN chicken/NN as/IN an/DT appetizer/NN tasted/VBD good/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ but/CC that/DT was/VBD it/PRP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ thing/NN that/WDT tasted/VBN decent/NN ./.

We/PRP waited/VBD 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB a/DT table/JJ ./.
A/DT waitress/NN came/VBD along/NN and/CC offered/VBD us/PRP drinks/VBZ ./.

The/DT music/NN is/VBZ usually/RB quite/JJ loud/NN so/RB this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT best/JJS talking/NN environment/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB been/VBN the/DT kind/NN of/IN woman/NN that/IN drank/JJ martinis/NNS and/CC cocktails/NNS ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/VBN I/PRP 'm/VBP happy/JJ with/IN a/DT pint/NN of/IN beer/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN is/VBZ a/DT tad/JJ pricey/NN but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ expected/VBN with/IN the/DT renovated/VBN restaurant/NN brand/NN ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT meal/NN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD good/JJ ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB make/VB this/DT a/DT regular/JJ restaurant/NN I/PRP turn/VBP too/RB ./.

My/NNP steak/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC baked/JJ potato/NN was/VBD horrid/JJ ./.

I/PRP had/VBD already/RB finished/VBN my/NN steak/NN so/IN I/PRP gave/VBD up/RP wanting/VBG the/DT Steak/NNP sauce/NN .../: in/IN the/DT end/NN my/VBD wife/NN took/VBD the/DT calamari/NN home/NN to/TO eat/VB there/RB (/VBN with/IN OUR/NNP Tabasco/NNP lol/NN )/NN Considering/VBG the/DT fancy/NN front/NN greeting/VBG area/NN with/IN the/DT attractive/JJ hostesses/NNS ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC staff/NN did/VBD n't/RB impress/JJ me/NN ./.

This/DT Moxie/NNP 's/POS branch/NN is/VBZ located/VBN inside/JJ Scarborough/NNP Town/NNP Centre/NNP ,/, near/IN Sears/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ quite/JJ large/JJ and/CC has/VBZ quite/RB a/DT chic/JJ seating/VBG area/NN ./.
Since/IN I/PRP was/VBD with/IN a/DT large/JJ table/JJ ,/, we/PRP were/VBD allowed/VBN to/TO sit/NN in/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, where/WRB there/EX are/VBP more/JJR large/JJ seating/VBG arrangements/NNS available/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT sirloin/NN with/IN prawn/JJ lobster/NN butter/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ specialties/NNS ./.
I/PRP specifically/RB wanted/VBD the/DT sirloin/NN to/TO be/VB medium/NN ,/, as/IN that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP I/PRP usually/RB go/VBP when/WRB I/PRP order/VBP steaks/NNS ./.
The/DT steak/NN took/VBD a/DT while/NN to/TO arrive/VB ,/, but/CC it/PRP did/VBD eventually/RB ./.
Upon/NNP first/JJ cut/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD already/RB tell/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD overcooked/VBN .../: there/EX was/VBD barely/RB any/DT pink/NN until/IN I/PRP got/VBD to/TO the/DT middle/NN ./.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD still/RB quite/JJ juicy/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP definitely/RB could/MD 've/VB been/VBN even/RB juicier/JJR if/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB overcooked/VBN ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT prawn/NN lobster/NN butter/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB taste/VB much/JJ of/IN the/DT prawn/NN lobster/NN feel/NN ;/: there/EX was/VBD definitely/RB butter/JJ on/IN it/PRP though/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN regular/JJ butter/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT people/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ table/JJ also/RB had/VBD an/DT overcooked/VBN steak/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT hostess/NN diligently/RB exchanged/VBD her/PRP overcooked/VBD steak/NN with/IN a/DT properly/RB grilled/VBN one/CD ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO change/NN mine/NN as/IN well/RB ,/, but/CC opted/VBD not/RB to/TO since/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO waste/VB another/DT steak/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD excellent/JJ ,/, despite/IN the/DT less/JJR than/IN spectacular/JJ experience/NN with/IN my/JJ food/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD ok/JJ but/CC why/RB are/VBP the/DT servers/NNS dressed/VBD in/IN super/NN short/JJ skirts/NNS and/CC low/JJ cut/NN tops/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB inappropriate/JJ and/CC uncalled/JJ for/IN in/IN a/DT family/NN restaurant/NN ./.
We/PRP saw/VBD way/RB more/JJR than/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO !/.

The/DT bennies/NNS were/VBD slightly/RB smaller/JJR ,/, but/CC the/DT hollandaise/NN tastes/VBZ better/JJR than/IN Cora/NNP 's/POS ./.

We/PRP would/MD have/VB preferred/VBN it/PRP pre/VBP made/VBN for/IN us/PRP and/CC with/IN a/DT balsamic/JJ vinaigrette/NN like/IN the/DT usually/NN do/VBP but/CC we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN it/PRP 's/VBZ done/VBN this/DT way/NN to/TO prevent/VB it/PRP from/IN getting/VBG soggy/JJ which/WDT may/MD indicate/VB that/IN the/DT food/NN does/VBZ n't/RB get/VB run/NNS to/TO the/DT tables/NNS right/RB away/RB ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT broccoli/NN and/CC cheese/NN soup/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB flavourful/JJ and/CC smooth/NN ./.
The/DT steak/JJ sandwich/NN and/CC was/VBD also/RB pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN with/IN some/DT sort/NN of/IN spicy/NN sauce/NN and/CC not/RB the/DT usual/JJ sweet/JJ savoury/NN sauce/NN ./.

Nothing/NN but/CC bad/JJ experiences/NNS and/CC bad/JJ food/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
We/PRP tried/VBP it/PRP a/DT couple/NN of/IN times/NNS thinking/VBG perhaps/RB it/PRP was/VBD an/DT off/JJ night/NN ./.
Nope/NN ,/, that/DT was/VBD not/RB the/DT case/NN ./.
The/DT wait/NN staff/NN -/JJ ridiculous/JJ wait/NN times/NNS and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD n't/RB even/RB near/VB busy/NN (/NNS on/IN the/DT occasions/NNS that/IN we/PRP went/VBD )/NN ./.
Then/RB the/DT food/NN -/NN nothing/NN came/VBD out/RP prepared/VBN correctly/NN or/CC with/IN enough/JJ heat/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD lukewarm/NN ./.
Ask/NNP to/TO have/VB it/PRP sent/VB back/RB -/JJ they/PRP still/RB could/MD n't/RB get/VB it/PRP right/RB ./.
After/IN the/DT 2nd/CD time/NN sending/VBG our/NN food/NN back/RB -/JJ we/PRP essentially/RB gave/VBD up/RB ./.
They/PRP need/VBP to/TO get/VB better/JJR cooks/NNS ,/, and/CC more/JJR responsive/JJ wait/NN staff/NN ./.
The/DT only/RB good/JJ thing/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ the/DT ambiance/NN and/CC decoration/NN ./.
Everything/NNP else/RB needs/VBD to/TO be/VB revamped/VBN ./.
Friday/NNP night/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD to/TO Moxies/NNP for/IN dinner/NN and/CC drinks/VBZ with/IN my/PRP$ gals/NNS ./.
We/PRP arrived/VBD around/IN 8ish/CD and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB make/VB reservations/NNS so/RB when/WRB they/PRP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT 20/NN minute/NN wait/NN ,/, we/PRP waited/VBD ./.
Luckily/RB ,/, the/DT wait/NN was/VBD only/RB 10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD a/DT pretty/JJ girl/NN who/WP instantly/RB rubbed/VBN us/PRP the/DT wrong/JJ way/NN ./.
When/WRB she/PRP approached/VBD us/PRP ,/, she/PRP just/RB did/VBD n't/RB have/VB a/DT personable/JJ attitude/NN and/CC looked/VBD away/RB and/CC down/RB while/IN reading/NN the/DT specials/NNS ./.
It/PRP did/VBD n't/RB come/VB across/RB as/IN her/PRP being/VBG nervous/NNS ,/, but/CC more/JJR so/RB as/IN if/IN she/PRP was/VBD bored/VBN and/CC sick/JJ of/IN repeating/VBG herself/NN ./.
We/PRP just/RB brushed/VBD the/DT little/JJ attitude/NN off/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT bottle/NN of/IN wine/NN and/CC she/PRP brought/VBD it/PRP to/TO the/DT table/JJ and/CC took/VBD our/NN orders/NNS ./.
After/IN ordering/VBG she/PRP asked/VBD if/IN we/PRP had/VBD any/DT allergies/NNS ./.
My/NNP friend/NN has/VBZ a/DT peanut/NN allergy/NN and/CC she/PRP awkwardly/RB held/VBD her/PRP hand/VBD out/RP and/CC said/VBD ``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO check/NN with/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ''/'' ./.
The/DT hand/NN out/IN really/RB threw/JJ us/PRP off/RP because/IN we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB sure/JJ what/WP she/PRP was/VBD reaching/VBG for/IN ./.
So/IN each/DT of/IN us/PRP are/VBP confused/VBN ``/`` Check/NNP with/IN the/DT kitchen/NN for/IN what/WP ?/. ''/''
Her/NNP hand/NN is/VBZ still/RB out/RB and/CC she/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN ``/`` I/PRP have/VBP to/TO check/NN with/IN the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO see/VB if/IN there/EX 's/VBZ any/DT peanuts/NNS ''/'' ./.
Again/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP confused/VBN by/IN the/DT hand/NN because/IN she/PRP was/VBD reaching/VBG it/PRP out/RP over/IN the/DT table/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ friend/NN who/WP had/VBD the/DT peanut/NN allergy/NN ./.
It/PRP looked/VBD like/IN she/PRP was/VBD asking/VBG for/IN the/DT wine/NN back/RB ./.
So/RB ,/, my/PRP$ friend/NN asks/VBZ ``/`` There/EX 's/VBZ peanuts/NNS in/IN the/DT wine/NN ?/. ''/''
And/CC the/DT waitress/NN said/VBD ``/`` No/NNP ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD ask/VB if/IN there/EX 's/VBZ any/DT in/IN the/DT food/NN you/PRP ordered/VBD ./.
I/PRP need/VBP the/DT menus/NN ./. ''/''
So/IN that/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB her/PRP hand/NN was/VBD out/RP like/IN that/DT for/IN the/DT awkwardest/JJS 15/CD seconds/NNS ever/RB ./.
Our/NNP food/NN came/VBD in/IN a/DT decent/JJ manner/NN but/CC when/WRB she/PRP brought/VBD out/RP our/PRP$ appetizers/NNS she/PRP literally/RB clanked/VBD the/DT dishes/NNS down/IN so/RB hard/JJ it/PRP made/VBD us/PRP all/DT jump/NN and/CC stop/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN our/PRP$ conversation/NN ./.
She/PRP also/RB did/VBD n't/RB apologize/VB for/IN the/DT startle/NN ./.
When/WRB she/PRP was/VBD collecting/VBG everyone/NN 's/POS empty/NN plate/NN ,/, my/PRP$ dish/NN was/VBD left/VBN on/IN the/DT table/JJ with/IN food/NN still/RB on/IN it/PRP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD clear/JJ it/PRP was/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN but/CC she/PRP never/RB asked/VBD if/IN I/PRP was/VBD still/RB eating/JJ ,/, if/IN I/PRP needed/VBP it/PRP packed/VBD up/RP or/CC if/IN everything/NN was/VBD ok/JJ with/IN my/PRP$ food/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB her/PRP if/IN I/PRP could/MD get/VB a/DT container/NN to/TO take/VB food/NN home/NN in/IN ./.
She/PRP brought/VBD me/PRP the/DT smallest/JJS container/NN ever/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD 3/VBN quesadilla/NN 's/POS that/IN I/PRP forced/VBP into/IN this/DT miniscule/NN box/NN that/WDT is/VBZ most/RBS likely/JJ meant/NN to/TO carry/VB home/NN some/DT fries/NNS ./.
She/PRP also/RB then/RB gives/VBZ me/PRP the/DT biggest/JJS brown/JJ paper/NN bag/NN ever/RB ./.
This/DT bag/NN could/MD have/VB literally/RB held/VBN knee/NN high/JJ boots/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD that/IN big/JJ ./.
I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP could/MD have/VB asked/VBN for/IN a/DT bigger/NN box/NN and/CC smaller/JJR bag/NN but/CC if/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB occur/VB her/PRP to/TO that/DT what/NN she/PRP was/VBD absurd/JJ ,/, I/PRP just/RB could/MD n't/RB be/VB bothered/VBN to/TO explain/NN at/IN this/DT point/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD understand/VB not/RB being/VBG in/IN a/DT great/JJ mood/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN general/JJ I/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB think/VB she/PRP gave/VBD a/DT rats/NNS a**/VBP about/IN her/PRP$ job/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB apparent/JJ she/PRP had/VBD no/DT interest/NN in/IN taking/JJ care/NN of/IN the/DT customers/NNS ./.
Needless/NNP to/TO say/VB she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB a/DT good/JJ tip/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD to/TO STC/NNP to/TO eat/VB at/IN moxie/NN 's/POS tonight/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN chipotle/NN quesadilla/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD alright/RB ./.
The/DT warm/NN plate/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ touch/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT dish/JJ itself/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ bland/NN ./.
I/PRP always/RB see/VBP reviews/VBZ that/IN say/NN ``/`` bland/NN ''/'' but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP it/PRP means/VBZ ,/, so/RB let/RB me/JJ explain/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD hardly/RB any/DT spices/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP guess/JJ there/NN was/VBD salt/JJ ,/, pepper/NN and/CC a/DT bit/NN of/IN chipotle/NN in/IN the/DT dish/JJ ./.
That/DT might/MD be/VB awesome/JJ if/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS were/VBD top-notch/JJ so/IN the/DT flavours/NNS would/MD shine/VB ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB top-notch/JJ ./.
The/DT bread/JJ itself/NN was/VBD soft/JJ -/JJ no/DT crisp/NN exterior/RB and/CC fluffy/JJ interior/NN ,/, just/RB .../: soft/NN ./.
The/DT chips/NNS had/VBD a/DT total/JJ count/NN of/IN five/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT salsa/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT yoghurt/NN dip/NN was/VBD very/RB strange/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD thin/JJ ,/, runny/JJ an/DT sour/JJ instead/NN of/IN tangy/NN ./.
It/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT 0/CD %/NN yoghurt/NN .../:
I/PRP prefer/VBP 8/CD %/NN greek/NN yoghurt/NN ./.
Something/NN that/IN actually/RB stays/NNS on/IN the/DT chip/NN and/CC wo/MD n't/RB drip/VB off/RP ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT salad/NN was/VBD phenomenal/JJ ./.
The/DT cheese/NN ,/, dressing/NN and/CC greens/NNS were/VBD all/DT amazing/JJ ./.
The/DT dessert/NN was/VBD .../:
Sorry/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, seriously/RB disappointing/JJ :/: (/IN I/PRP got/VBD a/DT bite/NN of/IN brownie/JJ (/NN mini/NN white/JJ chocolate/NN brownie/NN )/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD so/RB dry/JJ !/.
It/PRP was/VBD also/RB not/RB sweet/JJ enough/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP a/DT relatively/RB light/JJ palette/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB chewy/JJ or/CC fudge-y/JJ at/IN all/DT like/IN a/DT brownie/NN should/MD be/VB ./.
It/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN cake/bread/JJ pudding/VBG that/DT 's/VBZ been/VBN left/JJ out/IN ,/, uncovered/JJ for/IN 5/CD days/NNS ./.
Superbly/RB dry/JJ ./.
The/DT whipped/JJ cream/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN was/VBD so/RB bland/JJ !/.
It/PRP was/VBD like/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB do/VB anything/NN to/TO it/PRP but/CC add/VBZ a/DT tiny/NN teaspoon/NN of/IN sugar/NN to/TO the/DT whole/JJ batch/NN ./.
Even/RB a/DT touch/NN of/IN vanilla/NN could/MD 've/VB improved/VBN the/DT cream/NN vastly/RB ./.
All/DT my/NN friends/VBZ kept/RB recommending/VBG it/PRP and/CC raving/VBG it/PRP so/RB I/PRP admit/VBP I/PRP am/VBP pretty/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
My/NNP friend/NN who/WP went/VBD with/IN me/PRP also/RB got/VBD the/DT bite/NN of/IN brownie/NN and/CC she/PRP said/VBD it/PRP 's/VBZ usually/RB not/RB as/IN dry/JJ ,/, but/CC she/PRP said/VBD she/PRP still/RB loves/VBZ Moxie/NNP 's/POS so/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ what/WP that/DT means/VBZ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN Moxie/NNP 's/POS standards/NNS of/IN food/NN .../: All/NN in/IN all/DT I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 'll/MD ever/VB go/NN to/TO the/DT STC/NNP moxie/NN 's/POS again/NN ./.
But/CC If/IN a/DT friend/NN asks/NN ,/, I/PRP may/MD try/VB the/DT fairview/NN moxie/NN 's/POS ./.
Romantic/NNP atmosphere/RB -/JJ perfect/NN for/IN dates/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN could/MD be/VB better/RBR ,/, waitress/NN tend/NN to/TO be/VB busier/NN with/IN bigger/JJ tables/NNS ./.
The/DT white/JJ chocolate/NN brownie/NN is/VBZ a/DT MUST/NNP ./.
Weekends/NNS usually/RB tend/VBP to/TO be/VB really/RB packed/VBN ,/, especially/RB for/IN dinners/NNS ,/, so/RB call/RB in/IN and/CC make/VB reservations/NNS !/.
I/PRP also/RB really/RB love/VB their/PRP$ salmon/NN ,/, average/JJ size/NN but/CC really/RB yum/JJ !/NN !/.
If/IN only/RB the/DT service/NN was/VBD a/DT better/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD rate/VB this/DT a/DT 5/NN !/.
However/RB ,/, their/PRP$ food/NN never/RB disappointed/VBD me/PRP !/.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD okay/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP was/VBD because/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT friday/NN night/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP pretty/RB sure/JJ the/DT waitress/NN forgot/NN about/IN my/PRP$ order/NN ./.
The/DT cocktail/NN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD meh/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT burger/NN and/CC fries/NNS and/CC they/PRP were/VBD lukewarm/NN when/WRB I/PRP got/VBP it/PRP ./.
Everybody/NNP else/RB got/VBD there/RB earlier/JJR and/CC said/VBD the/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
I/PRP go/VBP to/TO Moxies/NNP all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.
This/DT location/NN is/VBZ alright/RB ,/, food/NN depends/NNS on/IN your/PRP$ luck/NN ./.
Sometimes/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ good/JJ ,/, sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ bad/JJ ./.
The/DT worst/JJ thing/NN about/IN this/DT Moxies/NNP is/VBZ their/PRP$ service/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP always/RB understaffed/JJ ./.
I/PRP expect/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN and/CC out/IN within/IN 30/CD mins/NNS ./.
At/IN this/DT location/NN ,/, it/PRP 'll/MD take/VB you/PRP an/DT hour/NN and/CC half/NN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ really/RB bad/JJ ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB even/RB get/VB me/PRP started/VB on/IN these/DT incompitant/NN waitresses/NNS ./.
If/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB women/NNS in/IN short/JJ skirts/NNS ,/, then/RB I/PRP will/MD go/VB to/TO the/DT clubs/NNS downtown/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP want/VBP competent/JJ service/NN ,/, then/RB I/PRP will/MD go/VB anywhere/RB else/RB but/CC here/RB ./.
Went/NNP to/TO Moxies/NNS in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN for/IN quick/JJ drink/NN and/CC afternoon/NN tea/NN after/IN shopping/JJ at/IN STC/NNP ./.
They/PRP were/VBD offering/VBG samples/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ ``/`` Today/NN 's/POS Special/JJ ''/'' and/CC Creemore/NNP ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RP ordering/VBG a/DT glass/NN of/IN Creemore/NNP and/CC a/DT White/NNP Peach/NNP Bellini/NNP ./.
The/DT bellini/NN was/VBD quite/JJ juicy/NN but/CC could/MD n't/RB taste/VB much/JJ alcohol/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
No/DT wonder/NN the/DT waitress/NN asked/VBD if/IN I/PRP want/VBP an/DT extra/NN shot/NN inside/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT separate/JJ menu/NN for/IN drinks/NNS and/CC desserts/NNS ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP picked/VBN the/DT Salted/NNP Housemade/NNP Caramel-Scented/NNP Cheesecake/NNP with/IN fresh/JJ blackberries/NNS and/CC orange/JJ bits/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC not/RB the/DT best/JJS cheesecake/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD n't/RB anything/JJ out/IN of/IN the/DT ordinary/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN flavour/JJ -/JJ though/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB the/DT side/NN berry/NN sauce/NN spiked/VBD more/RBR flavour/JJ for/IN the/DT cake/NN ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN at/IN this/DT Moxies/NNP is/VBZ quite/JJ relaxing/NN ,/, especially/RB being/VBG seated/VBN next/JJ to/TO the/DT windows/NNS ./.
Makes/NNP summer/VBD seem/VBP closer/NN to/TO reality/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD not/RB bad/JJ too/RB -/JJ food/NN was/VBD served/VBN fast/NN and/CC waitress/NN did/VBD check/NN on/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ every/DT so/RB often/RB ./.
Came/NN here/RB on/IN a/DT Tuesday/NNP ,/, service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ ,/, although/IN it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN and/CC they/PRP had/VBD 2-3/JJ severs/NNS within/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
Drinks/NNP came/VBD out/RP fine/NN ,/, waitresses/VBZ forgot/NN to/TO serve/VB us/PRP another/DT round/NN when/WRB we/PRP asked/VBD ./.
Restaurant/NNP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB mashed/VBN potatoes/NNS (/IN it/PRP was/VBD 7pm/CD )/NNS ,/, steak/JJ came/VBD out/IN alright/NN ,/, had/VBD better/VBN at/IN similar/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
We/PRP did/VBD not/RB get/VB served/VBN small/JJ plates/NNS or/CC folks/NNS for/IN apps/NNS to/TO share/NN !/.
What/WP happened/VBD moxies/NNS ,/, you/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB my/VBN favourite/JJ !/.
I/PRP think/VBP Moxie/NNP 's/POS needs/NN to/TO have/VB more/JJR vegetarian/JJ options/NNS !/.
Also/RB ,/, Vegetarians/NNS please/VBP note/IN their/PRP$ fries/NNS are/VBP fried/VBN in/IN the/DT same/JJ oil/NN as/IN their/PRP$ chicken/NN ./.
My/NNP last/JJ 2/NN visits/NNS here/RB were/VBD really/RB dissatisfying/JJ !/.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD incredibly/RB slow/JJ although/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD not/RB busy/JJ and/CC our/JJ food/NN took/VBD forever/NN to/TO come/VB !/.
Would/NNP not/RB be/VB visiting/VBG for/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ there/NNS are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS who/WP love/JJ this/DT restaurant/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ nothing/NN against/IN them/PRP ./.

``/`` Oh/JJ .../NN by/IN the/DT way/NN .../: this/DT is/VBZ your/VBG uniform/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, why/IN should/MD I/VB pay/VB $/$ 16/CD for/IN romaine/NN lettuce/NN with/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN grilled/JJ chicken/NN slapped/VBD on/IN top/JJ ?/.
Not/RB even/RB good/JJ quality/NN chicken/NN ,/, probably/RB frozen/VBN chicken/NN that/IN came/NN from/IN a/DT horrible/JJ farm/NN where/WRB they/PRP make/VBP the/DT chickens/NNS do/VBP handstands/NNS and/CC lay/NN eggs/NNS at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN before/IN their/PRP$ death/NN ./.

You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB tell/VB me/PRP there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT drink/NN special/NN (/VBD $/$ 3/CD !/CD )/.

No/DT ./.
You/PRP can/MD not/RB do/VB that/IN to/TO me/PRP ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ sneaky/JJ ,/, and/CC you/PRP 're/VBP trying/VBG to/TO sucker/VB me/PRP into/IN buying/NN lots/NNS of/IN these/DT $/$ 3/CD drinks/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP just/RB wo/VBP n't/RB do/VB it/PRP ./.
Nor/NNP will/MD I/VB ever/RB go/JJ back/RB ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT reason/NN all/DT Moxie/NNP 's/POS locations/NNS are/VBP in/IN a/DT mall/NN ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP essentially/RB paying/VBG to/TO eat/VB food/NN court/NN food/NN on/IN a/DT fancier/JJR chair/NN ./.

Definitely/RB was/VBD food/NN poisoning/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP convinced/VBN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT mushrooms/NNS on/IN the/DT pizza/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP no/DT allergies/NNS and/CC was/VBD n't/RB sick/JJ otherwise/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP contacting/VBG the/DT Restaraunt/NNP to/TO notify/VB them/PRP to/TO get/VB rid/NN of/IN that/DT batch/NN of/IN mushrooms/NNS to/TO avoid/VB other/JJ customers/NNS falling/VBP ill/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN contacting/VBG public/JJ health/NN ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB ./.
Would/NNP not/RB recommend/VB the/DT restaurant/NN to/TO anyone/NN ./.
Came/NNP here/RB once/RB to/TO celebrate/VB a/DT girlfriend/NN 's/POS birthday/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT red/VBN thai/NN curry/NN chicken/NN and/CC it/PRP did/VBD not/RB taste/VB as/RB good/JJ as/IN it/PRP looked/VBD ./.
Extremely/RB slow/JJ service/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
Other/JJ than/IN that/DT ,/, good/JJ ambiance/NN and/CC friendly/RB waiters/NNS ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB returning/VBG any/DT time/NN soon/RB ./.
Their/NNP steak/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG although/IN the/DT portion/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ small/JJ ./.
Pastas/NNP are/VBP great/JJ too/RB and/CC signature/VB mosaic/JJ dip/NN ./.
Perhaps/NNP it/PRP was/VBD the/DT lunch/NN hour/NN or/CC it/PRP was/VBD because/IN I/PRP was/VBD ensconced/VBN away/RB in/IN a/DT cozy/NN little/JJ booth/NN on/IN the/DT perimeter/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN or/CC that/IN my/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD a/DT guy/JJ but/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB get/VB a/DT feel/NN for/IN the/DT ``/`` Hooters/NNP ''/'' -esque/JJ servers/NNS at/IN Moxie/NNP 's/POS ./.
Yep/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ guy/NN was/VBD fully/RB clad/JJ with/IN not/RB a/DT scintillating/JJ view/NN in/IN sight/NN ,/, a/DT tad/NN on/IN the/DT scatterbrained-side/JJ (/NN perhaps/VBD that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT Hooters/NNP server/NN in/IN him/PRP .../: yes/NNS ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO Hooters/NNP and/CC yes/NNS ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP dealt/VBN with/IN some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ more/RBR ``/`` scatterbrained/VBN ''/'' servers/NNS ./. )/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT servers/NNS I/PRP saw/VBD yesterday/NN were/VBD male/NN ./.
Not/RB really/RB anything/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN ./.
On/IN to/TO the/DT menu/NN ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP slightly/RB inflated/VBN here/RB for/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, especially/RB for/IN some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ regular/JJ entrees/NNS ,/, but/CC off/IN the/DT lunch/NN menu/NN ?/.
Pretty/NNP reasonable/NN ./.
Moxie/NNP 's/POS seems/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT salad/JJ lovers/NNS following/VBG and/CC my/VBG friend/NN had/VBD the/DT Lime/NNP Mayan/NNP Chicken/NNP Salad/NNP and/CC really/NNP seemed/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB it/PRP ./.
It/PRP looked/VBD pretty/RB substantial/JJ but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB really/RB a/DT salad-for-an-entire-meal/JJ kind/NN of/IN girl/NN ./.
As/IN soon/RB as/IN I/PRP saw/VBD the/DT Lobster/NNP and/CC Brie/NNP Grilled/VBD Sandwich/NNP (/NNP $/$ 15/CD )/CD ,/, I/PRP started/VBD salivating/VBG ./.
Lobster/NNP ?/.
And/CC cheese/NN ?/.
In/IN a/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN ?/.
Oh/NNP yes/VBZ please/NN !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ mentioning/NN that/IN the/DT sandwich/JJ also/RB came/VBD with/IN a/DT small/JJ spring/NN salad/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
Spring/VBG greens/NNS ,/, cranberries/NNS ,/, feta/NN and/CC a/DT light/JJ dressing/NN ./.
Good/NNP complement/NN to/TO the/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN ./.
And/CC oh/JJ what/WP a/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN it/PRP was/VBD ./.
I/PRP am/VBP a/DT lover/NN of/IN grilled/JJ cheese/NN sandwiches/NNS ./.
This/DT one/NN was/VBD pretty/RB darned/VBN good/JJ ./.
The/DT bread/NN was/VBD marbled/VBN to/TO a/DT golden/NN brown/NN perfection/NN ./.
You/PRP know/VBP that/IN little/JJ bit/NN of/IN crunch/NN when/WRB you/PRP first/RB bite/JJ in/IN with/IN the/DT soft/JJ layer/NN of/IN bread/JJ just/RB below/IN the/DT surface/NN ?/.
That/DT was/VBD there/RB ./.
Then/RB came/VBD the/DT cheeses/NNS .../: Brie/NNP ,/, cheddar/NN .../: warm/NN ,/, melted/VBD ,/, ooey/JJ goodness/NN ./.
And/CC enveloped/VBD in/IN the/DT cheese/NN was/VBD a/DT good/JJ portion/NN of/IN lobster/NN meat/NN and/CC the/DT occasional/JJ hint/NN of/IN grilled/JJ onions/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP wipe/VB the/DT drool/NN off/IN my/PRP$ face/NN now/RB as/IN I/PRP sit/VBP here/RB recalling/VBG the/DT savoury/JJ goodness/NN of/IN yesterday/NN 's/POS lunch/NN ./.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB speak/VB for/IN anything/NN else/RB on/IN the/DT menu/NN but/CC what/WP I/PRP can/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP will/MD be/VB returning/VBG for/IN the/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT near/NN future/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP even/RB today/NN ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN someone/NN else/NN who/WP said/VBD this/DT :/: ``/`` The/DT olny/JJ thing/NN it/PRP was/VBD missing/VBG is/VBZ a/DT stripper/NN pole/NN ''/'' ./.
The/DT bad/JJ boy/NN beers/NNS might/MD be/VB cheap/NN on/IN Friday/NNP but/CC It/PRP dose/VBP n't/RB really/RB matter/VB when/WRB the/DT ditsy/JJ blonde/NN serving/VBG you/PRP forgets/VBZ haif/VB the/DT drinks/NNS you/PRP order/VBP just/RB to/TO screw/VB up/RP the/DT bill/NN in/IN the/DT end/NN anyways/NNS ./.
I/PRP found/VBD getting/VBG my/NNS boyfriend/NN or/CC a/DT guy/JJ co/NN worker/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO get/VB them/PRP to/TO come/VB over/IN to/TO serve/VB us/PRP which/WDT really/RB bugged/VBD me/PRP ./.

Visited/VBD the/DT Scarborough/NNP location/NN and/CC our/PRP$ server/NN Andrew/NNP was/VBD incredible/JJ ,/, attentive/JJ and/CC overall/VBD a/DT great/JJ server/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP hot/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
The/DT reason/NN I/PRP likely/JJ wo/MD n't/RB go/VB back/RB is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO the/DT G.M/NNP that/IN was/VBD working/VBG today/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN the/DT hostess/NN asked/VBD us/PRP if/IN we/PRP wanted/VBP Lounge/NNP or/CC Dining/NNP and/CC the/DT GM/NNP chimed/VBD in/IN with/IN some/DT unnecessary/JJ comments/NNS about/IN having/CD to/TO be/VB 19/VBN to/TO sit/NN in/IN the/DT lounge/NN (/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP 24/JJ and/CC was/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ mother/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ he/PRP thought/VBD he/PRP was/VBD charming/VBG but/CC both/DT myself/NN and/CC obviously/RB the/DT hostess/NN felt/VBD uncomfortable/JJ that/IN he/PRP commented/VBD when/WRB he/PRP really/RB did/VBD n't/RB need/VB too/RB ./.
While/IN eating/VBG this/DT obnoxious/JJ GM/NNP continued/VBD to/TO comment/NN at/IN each/DT table/JJ and/CC interrupting/JJ all/PDT the/DT guests/NNS as/IN he/PRP spoke/VBD way/NN to/TO loud/VB and/CC ruined/VBD the/DT entire/JJ atmosphere/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
If/IN he/PRP is/VBZ that/IN forward/NN to/TO make/VB comments/NNS to/TO patrons/NNS ,/, I/PRP wonder/VBP what/WP he/PRP says/VBZ to/TO the/DT female/JJ wait/NN staff/NN ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD bustling/VBG on/IN a/DT Monday/NNP night/NN which/WDT is/VBZ clearly/RB an/DT indicator/NN of/IN its/PRP$ popularity/NN ./.
Although/IN obviously/RB busy/NN ,/, our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD charming/VBG and/CC the/DT meal/NN delivery/NN was/VBD perfectly/RB timed/VBN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT triple/NN AAA/NNP steak/NN sandwich/NN from/IN the/DT winter/NN menu/NN and/CC although/IN I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT portion/NN size/NN was/VBD small/JJ there/NN was/VBD a/DT bonus/NN to/TO it/PRP -/-NONE- it/PRP left/VBD me/PRP more/JJR room/NN for/IN dessert/NN :/: warm/NN Gingerbread/RB cake/NN ./.

Dined/NNP in/IN ,/, ordered/IN a/DT lobster/NN and/CC shrimp/NN pasta/NN and/CC I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ delicious/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP did/VBD also/RB order/VB a/DT chicken/NN and/CC mushroom/NN pasta/NN to/TO go/VB for/IN the/DT boyfriend/NN ./.
Quite/JJ disappointing/NN !/.
The/DT pasta/NN was/VBD under/IN cooked/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT portion/NN size/NN was/VBD practically/RB made/VBN for/IN a/DT child/NN ./.
Moxie/NNP 's/POS needs/NN to/TO work/VB on/IN their/PRP$ consistency/NN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN more/RBR ./.
You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB just/RB give/VB people/NNS a/DT smaller/JJR portion/NN just/RB because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ take/JJ out/NN ./.
Went/NNP here/RB for/IN dinner/NN ./.
Waited/NNP about/IN 20/CD min/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB bad/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ dimly/RB lit/NN and/CC very/RB noisy/JJ on/IN a/DT weekend/JJ so/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VBP somewhere/RB quieter/JJ to/TO talk/NN to/TO the/DT people/NNS at/IN your/PRP$ table..do/NN n't/RB go/VB here/RB ./.
The/DT server/NN we/PRP had/VBD was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC apologized/VBD for/IN the/DT loud/NN group/NN we/PRP had/VBD beside/JJ us/PRP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB very/RB hungry/JJ so/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP 2/JJ appetizers/NNS -/JJ the/DT lettuce/NN wrap/NN and/CC some/DT sushi/JJ thing/NN on/IN taro/NN chips/NNS ./.
The/DT lettuce/NN wrap/NN with/IN marinated/VBN chicken/NN and/CC Thai/NNP inspired/VBD flavours/NNS was/VBD actually/RB pretty/RB nice/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD order/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT decent/JJ portion/NN for/IN an/DT appetizer/NN -/NN to/TO be/VB honest/NN for/IN me/NN that/IN is/VBZ probably/RB enough/RB for/IN a/DT whole/JJ meal/NN with/IN probably/RB a/DT little/JJ small/JJ side/NN ./.
The/DT lettuce/NN give/VBD the/DT dish/JJ a/DT nice/JJ crisp/NN ,/, fresh/JJ taste/NN ./.

The/DT steak/JJ my/NN dad/NN had/VBD (/VBN medium/NN )/NN was/VBD pretty/RB decent/JJ he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ./. ,/, and/CC he/PRP has/VBZ high/JJ steak/NN standards/NNS !/.
Overall/IN not/RB bad/JJ place/NN but/CC not/RB really/RB a/DT first/JJ choice/NN for/IN a/DT dining/JJ experience/NN ./.
Wings/NNS are/VBP mediocre/RB ./.
Oven/NNP roasted/VBD ribs/NNS were/VBD ok/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD probably/RB not/RB pay/VB 20/JJ $/$ for/IN that/DT again/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN the/DT honey/NN garlic/NN steak/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD perfectly/RB cooked/VBN the/DT way/NN I/PRP had/VBD requested/VBN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD flavourful/JJ ,/, although/IN ,/, I/PRP expected/VBP it/PRP to/TO taste/VB more/JJR like/IN honey/NN garlic../NN
It/PRP had/VBD an/DT aggressive/JJ lemony/NN taste/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, I/PRP always/RB see/VBP so/RB many/JJ servers/NNS walking/VBG around/IN yet/RB mine/JJ just/RB is/VBZ n't/RB there/RB when/WRB I/PRP need/VBP her/PRP ./.
The/DT managers/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP encountered/VBN there/RB have/VBP exquisite/JJ customer/NN serving/VBG skills/NNS ./.
Drinks/NNS are/VBP great/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN sucked/VBD !/RB !/VBN !/NN !/.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT steak/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD horrible/JJ and/CC way/NN over/IN priced/NNS ,/, the/DT rice/NN I/PRP swear/JJ was/VBD instant/JJ ,/, yes/VBZ the/DT servers/NNS were/VBD good/JJ looking/NN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB care/VB about/IN that/IN I/PRP just/RB wanted/VBD to/TO eat/VB after/IN a/DT hard/JJ day/NN 's/POS shopping/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.
Yes/VBZ the/DT decor/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ but/CC again/RB .../VBD the/DT food/NN sucked/VBD !/.
Never/NNP again/RB
Seeing/NNP as/IN the/DT first/JJ 2/CD reviews/NNS were/VBD rather/RB negative/JJ ,/, maybe/VBP a/DT change/NN in/IN perspective/JJ is/VBZ in/IN order/NN here/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP only/RB a/DT handful/JJ of/IN restaurants/NNS in/IN Scarborough/NNP that/IN are/VBP good/JJ for/IN hangouts/NNS ./.
Moxies/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN them/PRP ./.
In/IN terms/NNS of/IN pricing/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB find/VB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP any/RB different/JJ than/IN Milestones/NNP or/CC Jack/NNP Astors/NNP ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP that/IN for/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP ,/, considering/VBG it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB gourmet/NN or/CC chef-worthy/JJ food/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ overpriced/VBN ,/, but/CC what/WP are/VBP the/DT other/JJ options/NNS in/IN Scarborough/NNP available/NNP for/IN a/DT better/JJR ambience/NN and/CC the/DT ``/`` upscale/JJ feel/NN ?/. ''/''
I/PRP challenge/VBP anyone/JJ to/TO name/VB a/DT restaurant/NN ./.
So/IN unfortunately/RB ,/, restaurants/NNS like/IN Moxies/NNPS and/CC Milestones/NNP will/MD continue/VB charging/VBG what/WP they/PRP charge/VBP until/IN we/PRP have/VBP more/VBN options/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ demographic/JJ area/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP think/VBP Moxie/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ bad/JJ ,/, you/PRP should/MD try/VB the/DT Baton/NNP Rouge/NNP across/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT Bellinis/NNP at/IN Moxie/NNP 's/POS ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ all-time/JJ favourite/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ White-Chocolate/JJ Brownie/NNP ./.
Hands/NNP down/NNP ,/, THE/NNP best/NNP dessert/NN from/IN a/DT chain/NN restaurant/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ definitely/RB one/CD thing/NN worth/NN getting/VBG fat/NN for/IN ./.
Their/NNP sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS are/VBP also/RB something/IN I/PRP order/VBP frequently/RB ./.
I/PRP also/RB love/VBP their/PRP$ Mosaic/NNP Dip/NNP as/IN an/DT appetizer/NN ./.
But/CC get/VBP it/PRP to/TO share/NN ,/, because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB filling/JJ ./.
Their/NNP stuffed/VBD baked/JJ potato/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS amazing/JJ sides/NNS ever/RB !/.
I/PRP would/MD steer/VB clear/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ salads/NNS as/IN they/PRP are/VBP overpriced/VBN and/CC usually/RB leave/IN you/PRP wanting/VBP more/JJR .../:
The/DT servers/NNS are/VBP ``/`` Hooters/NNP ''/'' -esque/JJ so/IN I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN Dave/NNP 's/POS comments/NNS about/IN not/RB bringing/JJ dates/NNS here/RB ,/, although/IN .../: if/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT wandering/VBG eye/NN ,/, the/DT date/NN probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB end/VB with/IN a/DT goodnight/NN kiss/NN anyways/NNS ,/, lol/NN ./.
Honestly/RB this/DT location/NN used/VBD to/TO be/VB my/VBN favourite/JJ up/IN until/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ few/JJ visits/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN sucks/VBZ now/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ n't/RB that/DT great/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB their/PRP$ beef/NN vindaloo/NN ,/, honey/NN garlic/NN wings/NNS ,/, the/DT chicken/NN tenders/NNS (/VBP the/DT fries/NNS are/VBP disgusting/VBG though/NN ,/, so/RB maybe/RB substitute/VB it/PRP for/IN sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/VBZ )/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT white/JJ chocolate/NN brownie/NN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD calamari/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD SUPER/NNP salty/NN ,/, made/VBD me/PRP hate/VB their/PRP$ calamari/NN after/IN ./.
You/PRP try/VBD to/TO eat/VB it/PRP but/CC all/DT you/PRP taste/VBP is/VBZ salt/JJ ./.
Sit/NN on/IN the/DT dining/NN room/NN side/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VBP proper/NN service/NN ./.
Sit/NNP in/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, forget/VBD the/DT service/NN ./.
They/PRP seriously/RB need/VBP to/TO improve/VB on/IN their/PRP$ service/NN ./.
Especially/RB in/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, one/CD time/NN I/PRP came/VBD my/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD horrible/JJ ,/, she/PRP kept/VBD going/VBG to/TO the/DT table/JJ with/IN 10/CD guys/NNS and/CC not/RB even/RB coming/VBG towards/NNS us/PRP ,/, made/VBD me/PRP never/RB want/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RB to/TO this/DT location/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ fav/NN restaurants/NNS especially/RB in/IN a/DT ghetto/NN place/NN like/IN Scarborough/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG ,/, the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ so/RB friendly/RB and/CC polite/RB ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP always/RB seated/VBN at/IN a/DT good/JJ seat/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ AMAZING/NNP ./.
Definitely/RB try/VBD the/DT Parmesan/NNP and/CC prosciutto/NNP chicken/NN sandwich..It/NN 's/POS a/DT customer/NN favourite/JJ !/NN !/.
The/DT guys/NNS working/NN here/RB are/VBP very/RB easy/JJ on/IN the/DT eyes/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ always/RB a/DT plus/NN ./.
You/PRP got/VBD ta/NN check/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN ./.
You/PRP won`t/VBP be/VB disappointed/VBN !/.
Dropped/VBN by/IN Moxie/NNP 's/POS just/RB for/IN a/DT quick/JJ night/NN cap/NN on/IN a/DT random/NN weekday/NN evening/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD A-OK./JJ We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT drinks/NNS and/CC the/DT waitress/NN just/RB served/VBD us/PRP without/IN incidents/NNS ./.
She/PRP even/RB checked/VBD on/IN us/PRP a/DT few/JJ times/NNS to/TO make/VB sure/JJ we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB anything/NN else/RB ./.
I/PRP did/VBD enjoy/JJ my/NN Red/VBD Wine/NNP Sangria/NNP ,/, a/DT little/JJ week/NN but/CC has/VBZ tons/NNS of/IN fresh/JJ fruits/NNS ,/, perfect/VBP for/IN a/DT hot/NN summer/NN evening/NN ./.
The/DT lounge/JJ area/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ dark/NN ,/, the/DT waitstaff/NN here/RB just/RB kind/JJ of/IN blend/NN in/IN with/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP my/JJ Yelp/NNP friends/NNS would/MD not/RB complain/VB about/IN those/DT short/JJ tight/NN dress/NN ./.
Beer/NNP selection/NN just/RB like/IN any/DT other/JJ Moxie/NNP 's/POS have/VBP a/DT really/RB boring/VBG beer/NN menu/NN ,/, but/CC seems/VBZ like/IN even/RB guys/NNS like/IN the/DT Belini/NNP here/RB ?/.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB a/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/IN and/CC was/VBD completely/RB unimpressed/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB a/DT couple/NN times/NN and/CC even/RB for/IN my/NN birthday/NN last/JJ year/NN but/CC the/DT food/NN has/VBZ gone/VBN downhill/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP also/RB disappointed/JJ because/IN the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP also/RB higher/JJR than/IN I/PRP last/JJ remembered/VBD them/PRP to/TO be/VB ./.
The/DT pasta/NN (/VBZ penne/NN )/NN was/VBD all/DT bunched/VBN together/NN when/WRB I/PRP ordered/VBP it/PRP and/CC the/DT veggie/NN burger/NN was/VBD not/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN I/PRP remembered/VBD it/PRP to/TO be/VB ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB making/VBG a/DT return/NN anytime/JJ soon/NN ./.
