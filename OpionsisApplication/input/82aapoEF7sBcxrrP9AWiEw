The/DT Burnham/NN can/MD be/VB entered/VBN directly/RB from/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT Hilton/NNP building/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD pretty/VBN impressed/VBN by/IN the/DT upscale/JJ nautical/JJ wall/NN deco/NN ./.
Everything/NNP still/RB looked/VBD as/IN though/IN the/DT plastic/JJ wrap/NN had/VBD just/RB been/VBN taken/VBN off/RP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD shown/VBN in/IN short/JJ order/NN to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ ,/, a/DT half-booth/JJ ordeal/NN ./.
Normally/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP all/DT about/IN the/DT booth/NN tables/NNS ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ booties/NNS sank/VBP a/DT little/JJ too/NN deep/NN into/IN the/DT plush/JJ seat/NN and/CC made/VBD the/DT table/JJ an/DT awkward/NN height/NN to/TO lean/VB your/PRP$ arms/NNS on/IN ./.
Which/NNP ,/, if/IN you/PRP have/VBP just/RB above/VBN can't-take-you-ANYWHERE/NN etiquette/NN like/IN me/PRP ,/, you/PRP tend/VBP to/TO do/VB quite/RB often/RB ./.

We/PRP were/VBD brought/VBG some/DT complimentary/JJ bread/NN and/CC olive/NN oil/NN while/IN looking/NN through/IN our/PRP$ menus/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT server/NN nearly/RB dropped/VBD the/DT bread/NN on/IN the/DT table/JJ instead/NN of/IN our/PRP$ plates/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT bread/NN was/VBD quite/JJ plainly/RB not/RB fresh/JJ ./.
A/DT rough/JJ start/NN ./.
Our/NNP hearts/NNS and/CC stomachs/NNS dropped/VBD a/DT little/JJ when/WRB we/PRP saw/VBP our/VBN first/JJ appetizer/NN (/NN not/RB part/NN of/IN the/DT Prix/NNP Fixe/NNP menu/NNP )/NNP ,/, five/CD tiny/NN Garlic/NNP &/CC Onion/NNP Beignets/NNP ./.
This/DT was/VBD definitely/RB not/RB Southern/JJ hospitality/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC gone/NN too/RB soon/RB ,/, including/VBG the/DT pickle/NN garnish/NN ./.
Each/DT of/IN us/PRP then/RB chose/VBP different/JJ salads/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ course/NN and/CC were/VBD pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN by/IN the/DT unique/JJ ingredients/NNS ./.
No/DT plain/NN Caesar/NN from/IN the/DT grab/NN bag/NN -/JJ mine/NN had/VBD a/DT crunchy/JJ mix/NN of/IN greens/NNS ,/, pickles/NNS ,/, sunchoke/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT light/JJ dressing/NN ./.
Main/NNP course/VBD involved/VBN a/DT Swordfish/JJ Schnitzel/NN for/IN me/PRP ,/, and/CC a/DT Sous/JJ Vide/NN Fried/VBN Chicken/NNP for/IN her/PRP ./.
You/PRP heard/VBD right/RB ./.
Schnitzel/NNP and/CC sous/JJ vide/NN ,/, chicken/NN and/CC swordfish/JJ ?/.
Did/NNP they/PRP draw/VBP these/DT combos/NNS out/IN of/IN a/DT hat/NN ?/.
Maybe/NNP ,/, but/CC they/PRP work/VBP surprisingly/RB well/RB together/RB -/JJ both/DT meats/NNS were/VBD tender/RB ,/, the/DT accompanying/VBG sides/NNS (/VBP radish/JJ +/NN mashed/VBD potatoes/NNS for/IN me/PRP )/VBD appropriately/RB balancing/VBG ./.

The/DT desserts/NNS were/VBD cute/JJ trays/NNS of/IN Petit/NNP Fours/NNP ,/, including/VBG cake/NN pops/NNS and/CC macarons/NNS ./.
Nothing/NN mind-boggling/NN ,/, but/CC easy/JJ to/TO pack/VB up/RP and/CC eat/NN on/IN the/DT go/NN ./.
Like/IN others/NNS have/VBP said/VBN ,/, service/NN was/VBD fairly/RB slow/JJ ./.
It/PRP took/VBD a/DT while/NN for/IN our/PRP$ dishes/NNS to/TO come/VB and/CC for/IN water/NN to/TO be/VB refilled/VBN even/RB though/IN we/PRP were/VBD one/CD of/IN probably/RB five/CD tables/NNS that/IN evening/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT place/NN you/PRP should/MD expect/VB to/TO grab/VB a/DT quick/JJ bite/JJ -/NN although/IN I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP spotted/VBD a/DT kid/JJ eating/VBG chicken/VBN tenders/NNS a/DT few/JJ tables/NNS over/IN ./.
But/CC food-wise/JJ ,/, we/PRP felt/VBD we/PRP got/VBD what/WP we/PRP paid/VBD $/$ 30/CD (/-NONE- +/VBZ an/DT appetizer/NN )/NN for/IN ./.
The/DT menu/NN ,/, the/DT staff/NN ,/, the/DT booty-sucking/JJ seats/NNS ,/, it/PRP all/VBD feels/NNS a/DT little/JJ experimental/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP got/VBD some/DT positive/JJ results/NNS out/IN of/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.

Chose/NNP this/DT restaurant/NN because/IN our/PRP$ party/NN had/VBD been/VBN to/TO most/RBS restaurants/NNS in/IN Cleveland/NNP and/CC the/DT Burnham/NN had/VBD only/RB been/VBN open/JJ 16/CD days/NNS when/WRB we/PRP ate/VBP there/RB ./.
Ours/NNP was/VBD a/DT party/NN of/IN four/CD and/CC had/VBD no/DT time/NN constraints/VBZ so/IN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO do/VB a/DT couple/NN courses/NNS of/IN splitting/VBG the/DT small/JJ plates/NNS ./.
After/IN our/PRP$ incredible/JJ waiter/NN Joseph/NNP walked/VBD us/PRP through/IN some/DT of/IN his/PRP$ favorite/JJ things/NNS and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT background/NN for/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, we/PRP chose/VBP our/VBN first/JJ course/NN as/IN Octopus/NNP salad/RB ,/, soft/RB shell/JJ crab/NN special/NN ,/, chilaquiles/NNS ,/, shrimp/NN and/CC grits/NNS ,/, and/CC fried/VBD rice/NN ./.
All/DT of/IN these/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD as/IN advertised/JJ and/CC devoured/VBD by/IN our/PRP$ party/NN ./.
The/DT octopus/NN salad/NN was/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT most/JJS tender/NN ,/, tasty/NN octopus/NNS we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN anywhere/RB in/IN the/DT country/NN let/VB alone/RB Cleveland/RB ./.
The/DT chilaquiles/NNS were/VBD like/IN a/DT mexican/JJ pancake/NN with/IN pulled/JJ pork/NN and/CC rock/NN shrimp/NN baked/VBD in/IN ./.
The/DT shrimp/NN and/CC grits/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ./.
Our/NNP second/VBD course/NN we/PRP chose/VBP soul/JJ bowl/NN (/NN mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN with/IN pork/NN belly/NN and/CC collard/NN greens/NNS )/RB ,/, boudin/NN and/CC mash/JJ (/NNS blood/NN sausage/NN and/CC mashed/VBD potatoes/NNS )/RB ,/, confit/JJ wings/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT five/CD cheese/NN pizza/NN ./.
While/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB collard/NN greens/NNS ,/, the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN and/CC huge/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN pork/NN belly/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
The/DT blood/NN sausage/NN and/CC mashed/VBD potatoes/NNS were/VBD a/DT british/irish/JJ delicacy/NN and/CC delight/NN ./.
The/DT mashed/JJ potatoes/NNS and/CC gravy/NN were/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT confit/JJ wings/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ salty/NN but/CC they/PRP literally/RB fell/VBD off/IN the/DT bone/NN and/CC were/VBD served/VBN with/IN a/DT green/JJ sauce/NN that/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB quite/VB figure/NNS out/IN what/WP it/PRP was/VBD ./.
The/DT pizza/NN was/VBD great/JJ topped/VBN with/IN tomato/NN and/CC basil/NN and/CC quite/JJ flavorful/JJ ./.
Our/NNP party/NN had/VBD a/DT couple/NN bottles/NNS of/IN wine/NN from/IN the/DT extensive/JJ wine/NN list/NN and/CC some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ cocktails/NNS (/VBP Sacre/NNP Bleu/NNP and/CC French/NNP 75/NNP )/NNP ./.

The/DT new/JJ hotel/NN is/VBZ beautiful/JJ inside/NN ./.

Our/NNP server/NN Joseph/NNP made/VBD the/DT night/NN especially/RB nice/JJ with/IN his/PRP$ knowledge/NN and/CC hospitality/NN ./.
Would/NNP like/VBD to/TO try/NNP breakfast/brunch/NN next/JJ time/NN maybe/NN but/CC we/PRP will/MD definitely/RB by/IN back/RB ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ why/NN urban/JJ farmer/NN has/VBZ better/VBN review/RB than/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ for/IN a/DT restaurant/NN that/WDT is/VBZ maintained/VBN by/IN the/DT hotel/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN 4/RB different/JJ meal/NN and/CC dessert/NN and/CC nothing/NN is/VBZ bad../NN

I/PRP 'm/VBP giving/VBG this/DT a/DT 4.5/CD star/NN due/JJ to/TO price/NN but/CC if/IN u/NNS are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT quality/NN and/CC taste/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT must/JJ try/NN in/IN Cleveland../NNP

I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN a/DT late/JJ solo/NN dinner/NN ,/, got/VBD in/IN on/IN a/DT business/NN flight/NN around/IN 10/CD PM/NNP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD two/CD small/JJ plates/NNS ,/, the/DT shitake/NN perogies/NNS and/CC the/DT goat/NN cheese/NN creme/NN brulee/NN because/IN they/PRP sounded/VBD the/DT most/RBS intriguing/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.
B/NNP The/DT goat/NN cheese/NN was/VBD rich/JJ if/IN not/RB particularly/RB flavorful/JJ ,/, went/VBD very/RB nicely/RB with/IN the/DT crostini/NN that/IN came/JJ along/NNS with/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT perogies/NNS were/VBD a/DT definite/JJ hit/NN however/RB ,/, savory/NN with/IN tart/NN sauerkraut/NN and/CC a/DT nice/JJ mashed/JJ potato/NN side/NN ./.
The/DT bartender/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
A/DT nice/JJ selection/NN of/IN beers/NNS on/IN draft/NN ./.
Overall/IN a/DT very/RB acceptable/JJ hotel/NN restaurant/NN ,/, ca/MD n't/RB comment/VB on/IN the/DT entree/NN options/NNS but/CC overall/JJ this/DT is/VBZ a/DT place/NN worth/IN a/DT visit/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VBP something/NN simple/NN and/CC are/VBP staying/VBG at/IN the/DT Hilton/NNP ./.
Slow/JJ service/NN and/CC okay/NN food/NN ./.
Only/RB ate/JJ here/RB because/IN too/RB cold/JJ to/TO walk/NN anywhere/RB ./.
Waiter/NNP spent/VBD most/JJS of/IN the/DT time/NN chatting/VBG with/IN another/DT table/JJ while/IN I/PRP needed/VBP service/NN ./.
Will/NNP not/RB eat/VB here/RB again/RB ./.
Came/NN here/RB for/IN lunch/NN with/IN two/CD others/NNS and/CC did/VBD not/RB have/VB a/DT great/JJ experience/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB busy/JJ upon/IN arrival/NN ,/, however/RB we/PRP made/VBD a/DT reservation/NN so/IN we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN within/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS of/IN arriving/VBG ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ day/NN so/IN we/PRP were/VBD asked/VBN if/IN we/PRP 'd/VBP like/IN outdoor/NN seating/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP agreed/VBD to/TO ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD extremely/RB poor/JJ ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT reservation/NN for/IN 12:15/CD ,/, we/PRP were/VBD sat/JJ at/IN 12:20/CD and/CC we/PRP did/VBD not/RB get/VB our/JJ food/NN until/IN 1:20/CD ./.
It/PRP took/VBD 20/CD minutes/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ server/NN to/TO ask/VB us/PRP what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO drink/NN ,/, and/CC another/DT 5-10/NN minutes/NNS for/IN my/PRP$ soda/NN to/TO arrive/VB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD n't/RB told/JJ what/WP the/DT soup/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN was/VBD ,/, we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB told/JJ about/IN any/DT specials/NNS and/CC we/NNS were/VBD n't/RB even/RB asked/VB if/IN we/PRP 'd/VBP dined/VBN with/IN them/PRP before/IN (/NN this/DT place/NN just/RB opened/VBD after/IN all/DT )/NNS ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, our/PRP$ server/NN took/VBD 30/CD minutes/NNS just/RB to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ order/NN ./.
25-30/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ our/JJ food/NN arrived/VBD ./.
My/NNP friends/VBZ got/IN the/DT field/NN green/JJ salads/NNS (/VBP which/WDT they/PRP actually/RB enjoyed/VBD ,/, hence/NN the/DT two/CD stars/NNS )/RB ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT buttermilk/NN chicken/NN sandwich/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP did/VBD not/RB enjoy/VB at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT breading/NN on/IN the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD bland/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ and/CC to/TO be/VB honest/RB ,/, when/WRB I/PRP cut/VBD my/PRP$ chicken/NN open/NN with/IN my/PRP$ knife/NN (/RB this/DT is/VBZ an/DT open-faced/JJ sandwich/NN by/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, something/VBD the/DT menu/NN does/VBZ n't/RB say/VB )/IN it/PRP looked/VBD pretty/RB gross/JJ in/IN the/DT middle/NN ./.
My/NNP fries/NNS were/VBD simple/JJ shoestring/VBG fries/NNS that/WDT tasted/VBN fine/NN ./.
The/DT poor/JJ service/NN in/IN combination/NN with/IN the/DT bland/NN tasting/VBG food/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT reason/NN I/PRP likely/JJ will/MD not/RB return/VB ./.
With/IN all/PDT the/DT great/JJ restaurants/NNS available/JJ in/IN Cleveland/NNP ,/, this/DT one/NN is/VBZ not/RB worth/JJ going/VBG to/TO (/NNS at/IN least/JJS for/IN lunch/NN )/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD not/RB the/DT best/JJS experience/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD decent/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD terrible/JJ ./.
Waited/NNP entirely/RB too/RB long/RB for/IN basic/JJ things/NNS like/IN drinks/NNS and/CC to/TO place/NN our/NNS order../NN mind/IN you/PRP ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD no/DT where/NN near/IN full/JJ ./.

Wo/NNP n't/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB ever/RB ./.
Not/RB worth/IN it/PRP ./.
Really/RB enjoyed/VBD our/PRP$ night/NN sitting/VBG at/IN the/DT bar/NN at/IN The/DT Burnham/NNP ./.
Rob/NNP the/DT bartender/mixologist/NN (/VBZ not/RB to/TO sound/VB too/RB hipster/JJ but/CC this/DT guy/NN is/VBZ a/DT professional/JJ )/NN was/VBD very/RB knowledgeable/JJ ,/, funny/JJ and/CC a/DT great/JJ steward/NN for/IN Cleveland/NN ./.

On/IN to/TO the/DT food/NN :/: Husbandface/NNP was/VBD obsessed/VBN with/IN the/DT pierogies/NNS ,/, I/PRP was/VBD obsessed/VBN with/IN the/DT French/NNP toast/NN small/JJ plate/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO try/CD to/TO recreate/VB it/PRP at/IN home/NN and/CC will/MD probably/RB fail/VB a/DT million/CD times/NNS it/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ ./.

Hilton/NNP needs/VBD to/TO up/RB service/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD meeting/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT terrific/JJ bar/NN on/IN the/DT 32nd/CD floor/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD 8:30/CD on/IN a/DT week/NN night/NN ./.
Almost/NNP no/DT one/NN in/IN the/DT place/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN may/MD have/VB also/RB been/VBN the/DT bartender/NN ./.
She/PRP paid/VBD almost/RB no/DT attention/NN to/TO us/PRP ./.
Bad/NNP service/NN can/MD certainly/RB ruin/VB a/DT good/JJ meal/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Had/NNP to/TO wait/VB a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN for/IN eggs/NNS and/CC sausage/NN ./.
Team/NNP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB short-staffed/JJ in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./.

I/PRP expected/VBP more/JJR efficiency/NN from/IN a/DT 4-star/JJ hotel/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN !/.
Sherri/NNP the/DT bartender/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ and/CC Chef/NNP Ryan/NNP brought/VBD the/DT food/NN directly/NN to/TO me/PRP !/.

Everything/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC tasty/JJ !/.
!/NN
Hotel/NNP restaurants/NNS are/VBP always/RB hit/JJ or/CC miss/NN but/CC this/DT one/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ experience/NN ./.
The/DT ambiance/NN is/VBZ upbeat/JJ and/CC lively/RB --/: an/DT open/JJ kitchen/NN will/MD also/RB help/VB with/IN that/DT --/: and/CC the/DT prices/NNS were/VBD fair/JJ ,/, if/IN not/RB better/JJR than/IN expected/VBN ./.
My/NNP Cotes/NNP du/NNP Rhone/NNP Ros√©/NNP was/VBD $/$ 9.50/CD a/DT glass/NN and/CC the/DT dinner/NN specials/NNS on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN included/VBD a/DT super/NN affordable/JJ (/NN and/CC pleasantly/RB portioned/VBN )/NN Sous/JJ Vide/NNP Chicken/NNP plate/NN ./.
Nothing/NN crazy/NN but/CC just/RB a/DT nice/JJ simple/NN home/NN cooked/VBD meal/NN while/IN traveling/NN --/: something/NN we/PRP all/DT crave/NN ./.
The/DT Sous/NNP Vide/NNP chicken/NN was/VBD well/RB prepared/VBN ,/, maybe/NN just/RB a/DT touch/NN over/IN done/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT creamy/NN mash/NN and/CC broccolini/NN were/VBD nice/JJ accompaniments/NNS ./.
While/IN the/DT broccolini/NN was/VBD a/DT tad/JJ under-salted/JJ ,/, the/DT mashed/JJ potatoes/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/NN over-salted/JJ so/IN I/PRP ate/VBP them/PRP together/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD perfect/JJ ./.
I/PRP can/MD handle/VB that/IN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB however/RB ,/, a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT BBQ/NNP sauce/NN that/WDT adorned/VBD the/DT chicken/NN ./.
Thankfully/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD mostly/RB served/VBN on/IN the/DT side/NN so/IN the/DT dish/NN was/VBD still/RB a/DT great/JJ choice/NN ./.
Johnny/NNP was/VBD a/DT very/RB pleasant/JJ server/NN and/CC we/PRP worked/VBD up/RP a/DT nice/JJ rapport/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP think/VBP the/DT restaurant/NN offers/VBZ good/JJ value/NN ,/, a/DT fun/JJ vibe/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ awesome/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD go/VB for/IN pre-/NN or/CC post-dinner/NN drinks/NNS at/IN the/DT 32/CD Bar/NNP (/NNP rooftop/NN )/NN !/.
Final/JJ thing/NN :/: I/PRP loved/VBD their/PRP$ dining/NN chairs/NNS ./.
Upholstered/NNP and/CC so/RB comfortable/JJ ./.
It/PRP may/MD sound/VB silly/RB but/CC chairs/VBZ make/VB a/DT huge/JJ difference/NN !/.
I/PRP felt/VBD relaxed/VBN the/DT whole/JJ time/NN ./.
We/PRP came/VBD in/IN after/IN watching/VBG a/DT sunset/NN up/IN at/IN Bar/NNP 32/CD on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP evening/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD read/VBN all/PDT the/DT Burnham/JJ reviews/NNS and/CC looked/VBD at/IN the/DT menu/NN on/IN line/NN ./.
It/PRP looked/VBD very/RB promising/JJ ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB blown/JJ away/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT reservation/NN which/WDT was/VBD not/RB required/VBN ./.
40-60/CD %/NN full/JJ during/IN the/DT peak/NN dining/VBG hour/NN ./.
Service/NNP while/IN attentive/NN was/VBD only/RB hotel/JJ restaurant/JJ style/NN ,/, Lacking/VBG the/DT type/NN of/IN service/NN professionals/NNS found/VBD in/IN fine/NN dining/VBG establishments/NNS ./.
The/DT menu/NN was/VBD very/RB well/RB composed/VBN and/CC interesting/JJ ./.
It/PRP offered/VBD some/DT good/JJ choices/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT preparation/NN and/CC presentation/NN was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ./.
The/DT prices/NNS were/VBD not/RB outrageous/JJ ./.
No/DT way/NN it/PRP gets/VBZ 5/JJ stars/NNS ./.
So/RB not/RB a/DT destination/NN place/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO meet/VB someone/NN staying/NN in/IN the/DT hotel/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT meal/NN there/RB ./.
But/CC no/DT more/JJR Burnham/NNS date/NN nights/NNS for/IN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP always/RB a/DT little/JJ skeptical/NN of/IN hotel/NN restaurants/bars/NNS ,/, but/CC this/DT one/CD impressed/JJ me/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC service/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB decent/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT patio/NN was/VBD n't/RB open/JJ yet/NN when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD there/RB ,/, so/RB I/PRP suspect/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ ./.
The/DT tapas/NNS are/VBP really/RB unique/JJ ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN entrees/NNS ./.
I/PRP did/VBD see/VB the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP ,/, ordered/NNP tapas/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP looked/VBD and/CC smelled/VBD amazing/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP 're/VBP really/RB generous/JJ portions/NNS ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD thought/IN his/PRP$ pork/NN entree/NN was/VBD smaller/JJR than/IN he/PRP wanted/VBD ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ fish/NN was/VBD perfection/NN ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB for/IN girls/NNS '/POS night/NN to/TO order/VB a/DT bunch/NN of/IN small/JJ plates/NNS !/.
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN one/CD star/NN before/IN ever/RB stepping/JJ foot/NN into/IN the/DT restaurant/JJ .../:
I/PRP called/VBD on/IN a/DT Monday/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT reservation/NN for/IN 12/CD people/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD told/VBN by/IN the/DT gentleman/NN who/WP answered/VBD the/DT phone/NN that/IN he/PRP needed/VBD manager/NN approval/NN for/IN that/IN many/JJ people/NNS ,/, and/CC put/VBD me/PRP on/IN hold/NN ./.
I/PRP waited/VBD a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS ,/, and/CC when/WRB he/PRP returned/VBD he/PRP informed/VBD me/PRP that/IN he/PRP could/MD n't/RB find/VB a/DT manager/NN but/CC would/MD take/VB down/RP my/PRP$ information/NN and/CC someone/NN would/MD call/VB me/PRP back/RB ./.
I/PRP waited/VBD 24/CD hours/NNS and/CC did/VBD n't/RB hear/VB from/IN anyone/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP called/VBP back/RB ./.
I/PRP explained/VBD that/IN I/PRP had/VBD called/VBN the/DT day/NN before/IN and/CC needed/VBD to/TO speak/NN to/TO a/DT manager/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD placed/VBN on/IN hold/NNS for/IN ELEVEN/NNP MINUTES/NNPS before/IN I/PRP finally/RB hung/JJ up/IN ./.
I/PRP called/VBD back/RB for/IN a/DT third/JJ time/NN and/CC immediately/RB asked/VBD to/TO speak/NN to/TO a/DT manager/NN ,/, by/IN which/WDT the/DT person/NN responded/VBD rudely/RB ``/`` well/RB can/MD I/VB take/VBP a/DT message/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP a/DT little/JJ busy/NN right/NN now/RB ./.

I/PRP was/VBD placed/VBN on/IN hold/NNP AGAIN/NNP ,/, this/DT time/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN five/CD minutes/NNS ./.
I/PRP FINALLY/VBP got/VBN a/DT manager/NN ,/, Franc/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT phone/NN who/WP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB bother/VB apologizing/NN for/IN my/PRP$ troubles/NNS ./.
On/IN Wednesday/NNP I/PRP get/VBP a/DT call/NN from/IN the/DT restaurant/NN (/IN two/CD days/NNS after/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ attempt/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT reservation/NN )/NN telling/VBG me/PRP they/PRP could/MD n't/RB accommodate/VB my/PRP$ party/NN ./.
I/PRP explained/VBD to/TO them/PRP that/IN the/DT manager/NN had/VBD confirmed/VBN just/RB yesterday/NN ,/, and/CC after/IN being/VBG placed/NNS on/IN hold/JJ YET/NNP AGAIN/NNP ,/, they/PRP confirmed/VBD that/IN indeed/JJ they/PRP could/MD accommodate/VB me/PRP ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP honestly/RB ./.
FIGURE/NNP YOUR/NNP SHIT/NNP OUT/NNP ./.
If/IN it/PRP were/VBD up/RB to/TO me/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD not/RB have/VB even/RB given/VBN this/DT restaurant/NN my/NN business/NN after/IN that/DT experience/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT group/NN had/VBD already/RB collectively/RB agreed/VBN to/TO eat/VB here/RB ./.
Fast/NNP forward/NN to/TO Saturday/NNP .../: Our/NNP server/NN was/VBD nice/RB enough/RB but/CC his/PRP$ ``/`` helpers/NNS ''/'' were/VBD more/RBR attentive/JJ than/IN he/PRP was/VBD ,/, we/PRP waited/VBD forever/NN for/IN our/PRP$ drinks/NNS and/CC dinner/NN ,/, one/CD persons/NNS meal/JJ never/RB made/VBN it/PRP out/IN ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB okay/JJ ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, the/DT experience/NN was/VBD awful/JJ and/CC there/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ other/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN Cleveland/NNS with/IN better/JJR food/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB returning/VBG to/TO the/DT Burnham/NN ./.
The/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT place/NN has/VBZ 3/VBN dollar/NN signs/NNS is/VBZ not/RB accurate/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT chicken/VBN confit/NN small/JJ plate/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD more/JJR than/IN filling/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD about/IN $/$ 11/CD ./.

Really/RB nice/RB ,/, modern/JJ ,/, and/CC quiet/JJ ambiance/NN for/IN a/DT late/JJ dinner/NN and/CC the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ readily/RB available/JJ to/TO suggest/NN what/WP to/TO eat/NN ./.
My/NNP co-worker/NN and/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT experience/NN ./.
Only/IN thing/NN I/PRP would/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN the/DT menu/NN needs/VBZ an/DT interpreter/NN basically/NN ./.
When/WRB you/PRP first/RB look/VBP at/IN it/PRP you/PRP read/VB something/NN like/IN bread/JJ pudding/VBG but/CC then/RB underneath/VB it/PRP states/IN there/EX are/VBP gizzards/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
Not/RB typically/RB what/WP you/PRP would/MD think/VB ,/, right/RB ?/.
Fact/NNP of/IN the/DT matter/NN is/VBZ ,/, after/IN our/PRP$ waitress/NN explained/VBD the/DT take/NN on/IN bread/JJ pudding/NN and/CC french/NN toast/NN that/IN they/PRP utilized/VBD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD much/JJ easier/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT decision/NN ./.
My/NNP co-worker/NN got/VBD a/DT french/NN toast/NN type/NN plate/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT savory/JJ take/NN on/IN a/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN dish/VB and/CC she/PRP thoroughly/RB enjoyed/VBD it/PRP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD at/IN The/DT Burnham/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN this/DT past/NN weekend/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD my/VBN friends/NNS birthday/NN and/CC we/PRP had/VBD a/DT party/NN of/IN 6/CD ./.

Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD super/NN nice/NN ,/, kept/VBD our/PRP$ drinks/NNS full/JJ and/CC brought/VBD out/RP our/PRP$ food/NN in/IN a/DT timely/RB manner/NN ./.

The/DT staff/NN was/VBD very/RB welcoming/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD highly/RB suggest/VB going/VBG here/RB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB for/IN dinner/NN a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD planning/VBG to/TO do/VB apps/NNS and/CC drinks/VBZ at/IN the/DT rooftop/NN bar/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD closed/VBN for/IN a/DT private/JJ event/NN so/IN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO head/NN downstairs/NNS for/IN dinner/NN ./.
A/DT lot/NN of/IN things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN sounded/VBD really/RB good/JJ to/TO me/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP went/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ usual/JJ go/NN to/TO and/CC ordered/VB the/DT salmon/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC was/VBD just/RB super/NN salty/NN so/RB not/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT Southwest/NNP shrimp/NN pizza/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
We/PRP were/VBD one/CD of/IN only/RB 3/CD or/CC 4/CD tables/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN so/RB service/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT prices/NNS were/VBD about/RB average/JJ with/IN most/JJS restaurants/NNS downtown/VBP so/RB nothing/RB too/RB shocking/VBG ./.
The/DT Burnham/NNP just/RB opened/VBD on/IN June/NNP 1st/CD and/CC we/PRP thought/VBD we/PRP 'd/MD try/VB something/NN new/JJ ./.
Normally/RB ,/, new/JJ restaurants/NNS mess/NN up/RB something/NN so/RB our/JJ expectations/NNS were/VBD not/RB high/JJ ./.
Let/NNP me/VBD say/VB this/DT .../NN Burnham/NN was/VBD phenomenal/JJ and/CC exceeded/JJ all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ expectations/NNS by/IN leaps/NNS and/CC bounds/NNS ./.
I/PRP can/MD not/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB !/.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ very/RB modern/JJ ,/, yet/RB warm/NN and/CC inviting/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD top/JJ notch/NN and/CC very/RB friendly/RB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN next/JJ to/TO the/DT bar/NN so/RB had/VBD the/DT chance/NN to/TO interact/NN with/IN their/PRP$ bartender/NN who/WP made/VBD the/DT experience/NN even/RB better/JJR ./.
Super/NNP friendly/RB guy/JJ ,/, very/RB knowledgeable/JJ mixologist/NN --/: everything/NN he/PRP made/VBD was/VBD great/JJ ./.
After/IN the/DT first/JJ round/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD letting/VBG him/PRP just/RB give/VBP us/PRP whatever/JJR he/PRP wanted/VBD ./.
He/PRP makes/VBZ great/JJ mocktails/NNS too/RB ./.
Food..OMG/NNP ./.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RB the/DT very/RB next/JJ day/NN and/CC repeat/VB the/DT entire/JJ experience/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP several/JJ small/JJ plates/NNS to/TO start/VB with/IN :/: calamari/NN ,/, pierogis/NNS ,/, and/CC octopus/NNS ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC the/DT preparations/NNS were/VBD creative/JJ and/CC unlike/JJ what/WP we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN at/IN other/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
We/PRP especially/VBP loved/VBN the/DT sauce/NN on/IN the/DT pierogis/NNS and/CC the/DT octopus/NN was/VBD so/RB good/JJ we/PRP wound/VBP up/RP getting/VBG another/DT order/NN ./.
For/IN dinner/NN ,/, we/PRP tried/VBP Oxtail/NNP ,/, Burnham/NNP Burger/NNP ,/, and/CC Shrimp/NNP &/CC Grits/NNP ./.
Once/NNP again/RB ,/, everything/NN was/VBD top/JJ notch/NN .../: our/NN plates/NNS were/VBD clean/JJ very/RB quickly/RB ./.

The/DT Burnham/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ addition/NN to/TO Cleveland/VB downtown/NN -/NN we/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB !/.

The/DT brunch/NN buffet/NN had/VBD a/DT beautiful/JJ display/NN and/CC was/VBD dutifully/RB maintained/VBN ./.
The/DT eggs/NNS were/VBD a/DT strange/JJ ,/, jiggly/RB texture/NN and/CC bland/NN ./.
The/DT French/NNP toast/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT syrup/NN was/VBD flavorless/JJ ./.
Excellent/NNP tasting/NN and/CC perfectly/RB portioned/VBN smoothie/NN shots/NNS ./.
Not/RB all/DT of/IN the/DT items/NNS were/VBD clearly/RB labeled/VBN so/RB my/JJ vegan/NN friend/NN was/VBD upset/JJ from/IN consuming/VBG meat/NN in/IN the/DT potato/NN hash/NN ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP signs/NNS for/IN each/DT prepared/NN item/NN with/IN symbols/NNS for/IN meat/NN ,/, dairy/JJ ,/, soy/JJ ,/, seafood/NN ,/, and/CC vegan/JJ items/NNS ./.
