I/PRP recently/RB had/VBD them/PRP make/VB my/PRP$ Fiancé/NNP a/DT Birthday/NNP Cake/NNP ,/, she/PRP has/VBZ a/DT Dairy/NNP allergy/NN and/CC they/PRP made/VBD her/PRP an/DT amazing/JJ Vegan/NNP Chocolate/NNP Cake/NNP with/IN Cookie/NNP crumbles/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT Vegan/NNP Buttercream/NNP Frosting/NNP ./.
My/NNP Fiancé/NNP cried/VBD of/IN joy/NN as/IN she/PRP had/VBD n't/RB had/VBN cake/NN in/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS due/JJ to/TO her/PRP$ allergy/NN and/CC now/RB she/PRP can/MD ./.
I/PRP also/RB picked/VBD up/RB 2/CD dozen/NN cookies/NNS ,/, they/PRP were/VBD awesome/JJ as/IN well/RB !/.
Thanks/NNP Veganbites/NNP ,/, you/PRP guys/VBZ rock/NN !/.
Good/NNP job/NN !/.
While/IN visiting/VBG Vegas/NNP I/PRP saw/VBP this/DT place/NN had/VBD a/DT Groupon/NNP deal/NN ./.
Given/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP eating/VBG vegan/NN but/CC still/RB wanted/VBD to/TO feel/VB indulgent/JJ in/IN Vegas/NNP I/PRP thought/VBD I/PRP 'd/MD give/VB it/PRP a/DT try/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ fantastic/JJ !/.
Really/RB nice/JJ people/NNS working/VBG there/RB ./.
The/DT yummies/NNS are/VBP so/RB good/JJ even/RB non/JJ vegans/NNS will/MD be/VB happy/JJ with/IN the/DT treats/NNS ./.
The/DT prices/NNS were/VBD on/IN par/NN with/IN most/JJS bakeries/NNS which/WDT was/VBD surprising/JJ given/NN most/RBS specialty/JJ places/NNS charge/VBP more/JJR ./.
But/CC not/RB this/DT place/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT few/JJ GF/NNP options/NNS ./.
Definitely/RB suggest/VBP giving/VBG this/DT place/NN a/DT try/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD quite/RB the/DT assortment/NN of/IN goodies/NNS when/WRB I/PRP went/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN weeks/NNS ago/IN ./.
After/IN much/JJ deliberation/NN I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT gluten-free/NN ,/, vegan/JJ carrot/NN cake/NN and/CC it/PRP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB --/: it/PRP was/VBD so/RB delicious/JJ !/.
My/NNP dad/VBD (/NN who/WP is/VBZ n't/RB vegan/JJ )/NN got/IN it/PRP and/CC loved/VBN it/PRP ,/, as/RB well/RB !/.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC knowledgeable/JJ ,/, too/RB ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB !/.
Went/NNP in/IN to/TO get/VB a/DT treat/NN for/IN my/PRP$ daughter/NN after/IN our/PRP$ movie/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP say/JJ you/PRP should/MD change/VB a/DT couple/NN of/IN things/NNS ./.
The/DT nat/NN or/CC flying/VBG bug/NN you/PRP have/VBP in/IN your/PRP$ cookie/NN display/NN case/NN ./.
Might/NNP be/VBD a/DT good/JJ idea/NN to/TO get/VB that/IN out/IN ./.
Also/RB ,/, do/VBP n't/RB display/VB Christmas/NNP cookie/NN as/IN you/PRP could/MD purchase/VB and/CC then/RB tell/JJ us/PRP we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB unless/VB you/PRP buy/VB a/DT dozen/NN ./.
Broke/NNP my/NNP kid/NN 's/POS heart/NN having/NN to/TO take/VB away/RP a/DT cookie/NN she/PRP wanted/VBD ./.
You/PRP get/VBP two/CD stars/NNS ,/, because/IN the/DT cookies/NNS we/PRP did/VBD get/VB were/VBD good/JJ ./.
Customer/NNP service/NN ,/, not/RB so/RB much/RB ./.
This/DT will/MD be/VB my/JJ go/NN to/TO sweet/JJ tooth/NN place/NN !/.
Do/NNP n't/RB be/VB biased/JJ and/CC not/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT try/NN because/IN its/PRP$ vegan/JJ ,/, try/RB it/PRP out/IN !/.
So/RB after/IN my/PRP$ review/NN lamenting/VBG dry/NN cupcakes/NNS ,/, the/DT owner/NN contacted/VBD me/PRP asking/VBP for/IN a/DT second/JJ chance/NN as/IN seen/JJ below/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD offered/VBG a/DT free/JJ cupcake/NN and/CC a/DT refund/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP finally/RB made/VBD my/PRP$ way/NN back/RB ./.
The/DT store/NN manager/NN was/VBD in/IN and/CC she/PRP was/VBD so/RB nice/JJ !/.
She/PRP knew/VBD who/WP I/PRP was/VBD ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ name/NN before/IN I/PRP even/RB said/VBD it/PRP ./.
So/IN she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB give/VB me/PRP 1/VB free/JJ cupcake/NN .../: .she/NN gave/VBD me/PRP 5/RB !/.
One/CD of/IN each/DT of/IN their/PRP$ non/JJ gluten/NN free/JJ selection/NN ./.
She/PRP said/VBD they/PRP had/VBD just/RB been/VBN finished/VBN two/CD hours/NNS ago/RB ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD red/VBN velvet/NN ,/, chocolate/NN ,/, vanilla/NNP ,/, carrot/NN cake/NN ,/, and/CC coconut/NN ./.
After/IN filling/VBG up/RP my/PRP$ cupcake/NN container/NN ,/, she/PRP then/RB was/VBD like/IN ,/, do/VBP you/PRP want/VB cookies/NNS to/TO ?/.
She/PRP gave/VBD me/PRP their/PRP$ chocolate/NN chip/NN cookie/NN and/CC their/PRP$ walnut/NN fudge/NN brownie/NN ./.
Then/RB she/PRP was/VBD even/RB was/VBD going/VBG to/TO give/VB me/PRP a/DT refund/NN still/RB ./.
I/PRP told/VBD her/PRP no/DT need/NN ,/, she/PRP gave/VBD me/PRP so/RB much/RB already/RB ./.
So/IN I/PRP headed/VBD home/NN with/IN my/JJ hoard/NN of/IN baked/JJ goods/NNS ./.
Now/RB after/IN waiting/VBG about/IN an/DT hour/NN they/PRP were/VBD still/RB pretty/RB cold/VB from/IN refrigeration/NN and/CC a/DT bit/NN dense/NN but/CC not/RB necessarily/RB dry/JJ ,/, so/RB after/IN giving/VBG an/DT initial/JJ taste/JJ test/NN ,/, I/PRP wrapped/VBD up/RP the/DT container/NN in/IN a/DT plastic/JJ bag/NN and/CC let/VB them/PRP sit/VB over/IN night/NN ./.
This/DT proved/VBD to/TO help/VB greatly/RB ,/, waiting/VBG at/IN least/JJS until/IN the/DT reached/NN fully/RB room/JJ temp/NN ,/, it/PRP melted/VBD the/DT coconut/NN topping/VBG a/DT bit/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP helped/VBD make/VB the/DT texture/NN great/NN on/IN all/PDT the/DT cakes/NNS .../: .except/IN the/DT vanilla/NN that/IN was/VBD still/RB very/RB dry/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD appreciate/VB no/DT raisens/NNS in/IN the/DT carrot/NN cake/NN though/IN !/.
Also/RB the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT coconut/NN was/VBD great/JJ in/IN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD filled/VBN with/IN coconut/NN pieces/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD my/JJ favorite/NN ./.
Now/RB the/DT icing/VBG on/IN everything/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN sweeter/JJR than/IN I/PRP prefer/VBP still/RB ,/, especially/RB the/DT vanilla/NN ./.
However/RB the/DT texture/NN was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC creamy/NN ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP as/IN they/PRP are/VBP open/RB longer/IN they/PRP get/VBP more/JJR creative/JJ with/IN fillings/NNS and/CC flavor/NN profiles/NNS ,/, maybe/RB add/VBD some/DT fresher/NN components/NNS like/IN a/DT refreshing/NN fruit/NN compote/NN or/CC curd/NN in/IN the/DT center/NN to/TO add/VB acid/NN and/CC counteract/VB the/DT sweetness/NN .../: .and/NN just/RB lessen/VBN the/DT sugar/NN except/NN in/IN the/DT chocolate/NN that/IN seemed/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ sweetness/NN level/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP what/WP seems/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT cupcake/NN of/IN the/DT week/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD the/DT coconut/NN in/IN this/DT time/NN around/IN ./.
While/IN it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN favorite/JJ ,/, it/PRP and/CC everything/NN could/MD use/VB an/DT extra/NN punch/NN to/TO set/VB them/PRP apart/VB and/CC really/RB make/VB the/DT flavors/NNS sing/NN ./.
Now/RB the/DT brownie/NN was/VBD hands/VBN down/RP awesome/JJ !/.
No/DT need/NN to/TO alter/VB anything/NN ,/, it/PRP truly/RB was/VBD a/DT fudgy/JJ peice/NN of/IN happiness/NN ./.
The/DT cookie/NN was/VBD decent/JJ ,/, almost/RB brownie/JJ like/IN as/IN well/RB ,/, I/PRP could/MD taste/VB they/PRP use/VBP coconut/NN oil/NN ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ if/IN the/DT intent/NN is/VBZ for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB in/IN the/DT flavor/NN ,/, but/CC over/IN all/DT I/PRP liked/VBD it/PRP ./.
Neither/NNP of/IN these/DT tasted/VBN overly/RB sweet/JJ either/NN ./.
So/RB basically/RB customer/VBN service/NN 5/NNS ,/, cake/NN base/NN 4.5/CD ,/, icing/VBG 4/NN ,/, originality/NN 2.5/CD ,/, baked/VBD goods/NNS 4/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT must/NN go/NN for/IN any/DT vegan/JJ seeking/VBG a/DT quick/JJ sweet/JJ snack/NN and/CC a/DT caffeine/NN pick/NN me/VBD up/RP !/.
They/PRP have/VBP lots/NNS of/IN non/JJ dairy/JJ milk/NN options/NNS and/CC flavor/NN add/NN ins/NNS for/IN lattes/NNS ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD a/DT plain/NN iced/VBN soy/JJ latte/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ price/NN for/IN the/DT size/NN and/CC delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP also/RB really/RB appreciated/VBN that/IN EVERYTHING/NNP was/VBD vegan/JJ rather/RB than/IN being/VBG pushed/VBN to/TO one/CD corner/NN of/IN the/DT baking/NN display/NN with/IN only/JJ two/CD or/CC three/CD vegan/JJ options/NNS ./.
Anything/IN you/PRP point/VBP to/TO in/IN the/DT pastry/NN case/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ and/CC cruelty/JJ free/JJ !/.
They/PRP also/RB had/VBD some/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ options/NNS and/CC many/JJ items/NNS with/IN no/DT nuts/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD delighted/VBN to/TO find/VB out/IN they/PRP do/VBP specialty/RB cakes/NNS ,/, for/IN birthdays/NNS and/CC weddings/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP always/RB made/VBN my/PRP$ own/JJ desserts/NNS for/IN birthdays/NNS but/CC that/IN option/NN would/MD save/VB me/PRP a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
Definitely/RB keep/RB this/DT place/NN in/IN mind/NN !/.
Prior/RB to/TO the/DT opening/NNP I/PRP had/VBD the/DT pleasure/NN of/IN trying/VBG their/PRP$ chocolate/NN cake/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP must/MD say/VB was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
The/DT cake/NN itself/NN was/VBD a/DT perfect/NN balance/NN for/IN a/DT rich/NN frosting/NN ./.
After/IN enjoying/VBG the/DT cake/NN I/PRP was/VBD looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO the/DT opening/NN and/CC was/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
The/DT cookies/NNS and/CC banana-chocolate/JJ bread/NN were/VBD both/DT great/JJ ./.
I/PRP highly/VBP recommend/JJ this/DT place/NN ./.
If/IN 0/-NONE- stars/NNS was/VBD an/DT option/NN I/PRP surely/RB would/MD select/VB 0/-NONE- stars/NNS ./.
They/PRP for/IN one/CD advertise/NN themselves/PRP as/IN a/DT vegan/JJ bakery/NN but/CC vegans/NNS BEWARE/IN they/PRP are/VBP NOT/NNP ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO get/VB coffee/NN here/RB they/PRP carry/VBP dairy/JJ creamers/NNS that/IN the/DT non-vegan/JJ staff/NN have/VBP no/DT clue/NN are/VBP n't/RB vegan/JJ ./.
They/PRP will/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN all/PDT the/DT creamers/NNS there/EX are/VBP 100/CD %/NN vegan/NN ,/, non/JJ dairy/JJ creamers/NNS because/IN they/PRP are/VBP clueless/JJ ./.
When/WRB I/PRP made/VBD the/DT owner/NN aware/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN he/PRP not/RB only/RB was/VBD the/DT most/RBS condescending/JJ jerk/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB talked/VBN to/TO ,/, He/PRP said/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP quote/RB ,/, ``/`` as/IN a/DT customer/NN you/PRP should/MD investigate/VB any/DT and/CC all/DT places/NNS that/IN you/PRP choose/VBP to/TO shop/VB if/IN 100/CD %/NN vegan/NN compliance/NN is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO you/PRP ./. ''/''
I/PRP think/VBP that/IN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP entering/VBG a/DT vegan/JJ establishment/NN you/PRP should/MD n't/RB have/VB to/TO investigate/NN ./.
It/PRP should/MD simply/RB be/VB vegan/JJ ./.
And/CC should/MD n't/RB 100/CD %/NN vegan/NN compliance/NN be/VB important/JJ to/TO a/DT vegan/JJ establishment/NN ?/.
If/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB trust/VB that/IN the/DT coffee/NN is/VBZ vegan/JJ or/CC not/RB I/PRP would/MD n't/RB touch/VB anything/NN from/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./.
They/PRP obviously/RB have/VBP no/DT clue/NN what/WP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO vegans/NNS ./.
They/PRP would/MD rather/RB cater/VB to/TO the/DT surrounding/NN businesses/NNS than/IN to/TO the/DT vegan/JJ customer/NN base/NN ./.
another/DT quote/NN from/IN him/PRP ,/, ``/`` Although/IN we/PRP aim/VBP to/TO please/VB every/DT customer/NN and/CC value/NN your/NN opinion/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN giving/VBG all/DT customers/NNS the/DT option/NN to/TO choose/VB the/DT type/NN of/IN creamer/NN they/PRP like/VBP in/IN there/NNP coffee/NN ,/, we/PRP chose/VBP to/TO carry/VB dairy/JJ creamer/NN ./.
Many/JJ customers/NNS in/IN the/DT surrounding/NN businesses/NNS have/VBP asked/VBN for/IN this/DT choice/NN ''/'' I/PRP feel/VBP those/DT customers/NNS that/WDT want/-NONE- dairy/VBP creamer/NN should/MD go/VB to/TO mad/VB house/NN coffee/NN right/RB across/IN the/DT street/NN if/IN they/PRP want/VBP dairy/JJ ,/, But/CC if/IN they/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO a/DT vegan/JJ establishment/NN they/PRP should/MD espect/VB VEGAN/NNP ./.
The/DT poor/JJ choices/NNS being/VBG made/VBN in/IN this/DT establishment/NN are/VBP appalling/VBG ./.
I/PRP will/MD never/RB return/VB to/TO vegan/JJ bites/NNS again/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP recommend/VBP you/PRP not/RB either/RB ./.
They/PRP are/VBP obviously/RB more/RBR influenced/JJ by/IN money/NN than/IN actually/RB trying/VBG to/TO make/VB the/DT vegan/JJ society/NN here/RB better/RBR ./.
Pathetic/NNP !/VBD !/CD !/NNS !/.

This/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ !/.
They/PRP have/VBP good/JJ food/NN and/CC stuff/NN !/.
I/PRP recommend/VBP that/IN you/PRP consume/VBP products/NNS from/IN this/DT establishment/NN because/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN matters/NNS !/.
I/PRP bought/VBD a/DT carrot/NN cake/NN cupcake/NN that/WDT was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
I/PRP also/RB bought/VBD a/DT banana/NN nut/NN loaf/NN that/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC some/DT gluten/JJ free/JJ chocolate/NN chip/NN cookies/VBZ that/IN were/VBD mediocre/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ cookies/NNS was/VBD the/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ part/NN ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB an/DT option/NN to/TO not/RB get/VB gluten/JJ free/JJ cookies/NNS so/IN I/PRP had/VBD no/DT choice/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD eat/VB the/DT cupcake/NN and/CC the/DT loaf/NN again/RB ./.
I/PRP will/MD pass/VB on/IN the/DT chocolate/NN chip/NN cookies/NNS though/IN ./.
While/IN we/PRP were/VBD in/IN Vegas/NNP last/JJ week/NN we/PRP we/PRP 're/VBP celebrating/VBG a/DT birthday/NN so/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT chocolate/NN cake/NN from/IN this/DT location/NN ./.
We/PRP have/VBP never/RB tried/VBN vegan/JJ pastries/NNS before/IN but/CC we/PRP will/MD definitely/RB try/VB them/PRP again/RB ./.

Lemon/NNP blueberry/JJ cake/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, moist/NN and/CC with/IN real/JJ blueberries/NNS not/RB just/RB blueberry/JJ flavor/NN ./.
However/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT really/RB small/JJ store/NN with/IN no/DT tables/NNS to/TO sit/VB and/CC enjoy/VB the/DT food/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP 2/VBG benches/NNS outside/RB ,/, but/CC thats/VBZ not/RB really/RB an/DT option/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT conversation/NN with/IN a/DT friend/NN ./.
Would/NNP have/VBP ordered/VBN coffee/NN but/CC the/DT coffee/NN creamers/NNS are/VBP definately/RB NOT/JJ vegan/NN ,/, why/WRB not/RB have/VB a/DT carton/NN of/IN soy/JJ or/CC coconut/JJ creamer/NN available/JJ ?/.
We/PRP forgot/VBP our/PRP$ prepaid/NN ,/, loaf/NN of/IN pumpkin/NN bread/NN on/IN Thanksgiving/NN :/: (/JJ Believe/NNP it/PRP or/CC not/RB ,/, they/PRP gave/VBD us/PRP a/DT delicious/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ ,/, loaf/NN ,/, a/DT week/NN late/NN and/CC never/RB charged/VBD a/DT penny/NN extra/NN !/NN !/.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ the/DT BEST/NNP !/.
