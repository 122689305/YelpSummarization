Very/NNP disappointing/NN experience/NN and/CC food/NN ./.
As/IN new/JJ residents/NNS to/TO Charlotte/VB we/PRP were/VBD excited/VBN to/TO try/VB new/JJ places/NNS ./.

That/DT might/MD have/VB been/VBN helpful/JJ to/TO know/VB when/WRB ordering/JJ ./.
Overall/IN the/DT entire/JJ time/NN our/PRP$ waitress/NN continually/RB forgot/JJ to/TO bring/VB us/PRP very/RB basic/JJ things/NNS ,/, like/IN beverages/NNS ,/, sauce/NN ,/, our/PRP$ check/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP stood/NN out/RP and/CC the/DT black-eyed/JJ peas/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
We/PRP both/VBP ordered/VBN the/DT Sliced/JJ Beef/NNP Brisket/NNP &/CC House/NNP Slaw/NNP with/IN Chips/NNP ./.

Thinly/RB slice/JJ potato/NN chip/NN and/CC playing/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT 6/JJ different/JJ sauces/NNS ./.
The/DT Spicy/NNP Green/NNP Beans-/NNP must/MD order/VB so/RB crunchy/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ./.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT chance/NN to/TO check/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN months/NNS ago/IN with/IN a/DT friend/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD heard/VBN about/IN the/DT place/NN and/CC finally/RB had/VBD the/DT time/NN to/TO visit/NN on/IN a/DT rainy/NN Saturday/NNP evening/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Cotswald/NNP plate/NN with/IN smoked/JJ chicken/NN and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN slaw/NN and/CC sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN ./.
I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT variety/NN of/IN sauces/NNS which/WDT I/PRP enjoyed/VBD for/IN the/DT Asian/JJ influence/NN since/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB really/RB feeling/VBG the/DT Carolina/NNP mustard/NN style/NN (/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT native/JJ Carolinian/NN to/TO be/VB fair/NN :/: -/JJ )/NN ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ sauce/NN was/VBD the/DT hoisin/NN with/IN the/DT Tongs/NNP Thai/NNP coming/NNP in/IN a/DT close/JJ second/NN ./.
Overall/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.

Everything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN sounded/VBD great/JJ and/CC the/DT sides/NNS were/VBD divided/VBN by/IN price/NN ./.
Just/NNP so/RB you/PRP know/VBP if/IN you/PRP order/VBP an/DT item/NN that/IN ``/`` comes/VBZ with/IN sides/NNS ''/'' that/IN what/WP it/PRP really/RB means/VBZ that/DT is/VBZ comes/VBN with/IN the/DT $/$ 3/CD sides/CD not/RB the/DT $/$ 4/CD sides/CD ./.
They/PRP are/VBP very/RB up/RB front/JJ about/IN it/PRP which/WDT I/PRP can/MD appreciate/VB ,/, but/CC seems/VBZ a/DT bit/NN extreme/JJ considering/VBG their/PRP$ prices/NNS are/VBP already/RB kind/JJ of/IN up/RB there/RB ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB go/VB by/IN the/DT menu/NN online/NN as/IN those/DT prices/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/JJ valid/JJ ./.
They/PRP 've/VBP raised/VBN the/DT prices/NNS by/IN a/DT good/JJ $/NN 2-3/CD ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT vinegar/NN based/VBN sauce/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS one/CD for/IN the/DT pork/NN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN said/VBD the/DT Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP only/RB thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD okay/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT spicy/NN green/JJ beans/NNS were/VBD yummy/JJ (/NN albeit/NN not/RB spicy/JJ )/NN ./.

The/DT jalapeno/NN cheese/NN grits/NNS were/VBD tasty/JJ w/the/JJ right/NN amount/NN of/IN heat/NN from/IN the/DT jalapenos/NNS for/IN a/DT person/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB like/VB spice/NN ./.
The/DT Bellybuster/NNP went/VBD half/DT eaten/JJ not/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT size/NN -/NN more/RBR so/RB again/RB somehow/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT dry/JJ side/NN ./.
The/DT spicy/NN green/JJ beans/NNS were/VBD thoroughly/RB enjoyed/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT crumbly/JJ type/NN of/IN cobbler/NN but/CC a/DT small/JJ round/NN cake/NN w/no/NN taste/JJ sandwiched/VBN between/IN a/DT single/JJ scoop/NN of/IN vanilla/NN ice/NN cream/NN &/CC berries/NNS ./.

The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP 110/CD S/NNP Sharon/NNP Amity/NNP Rd/NNP Charlotte/NNP ,/, NC/NNP 28211/CD Friday/NNP May/NNP 12/CD ,/, 2017/CD 8:30pm/CD I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN putting/VBG off/RP visiting/VBG The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP and/CC I/PRP am/VBP mad/JJ at/IN myself/NN for/IN doing/NN that/IN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP really/RB transformed/VBN this/DT little/JJ space/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP so/RB glad/JJ they/PRP have/VBP !/VBN
On/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN we/PRP were/VBD quickly/RB seated/VBN and/CC our/PRP$ server/NN came/VBD right/NN over/IN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ n't/RB extensive/JJ but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBN loads/NNS of/IN options/NNS and/CC what/WP really/RB kills/VBZ me/PRP is/VBZ there/RB are/VBP monthly/JJ specials/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT hard/JJ decision/NN but/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO choose/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT specials/NNS ./.
This/DT months/NNS specials/NNS are/VBP the/DT Mac/NNP and/CC Cheese/NNP BBQ/NNP Burrito/NNP and/CC the/DT BBQ/NNP Fried/NNP Rice/NNP ./.
Since/IN I/PRP love/VBP all/DT things/NNS Asian/JJ Fusion/NNP I/PRP had/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT BBQ/NNP Fried/NNP Rice/NNP with/IN BBQ/NNP pork/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB added/VBD the/DT andouille/JJ sausage/NN to/TO the/DT entree/NN ./.
This/DT dish/NN was/VBD a/DT very/RB large/JJ portion/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD enough/RB for/IN lunch/NN the/DT next/JJ day/NN ./.
There/EX a/DT lot/NN of/IN crispy/NN BBQ/NNP pieces/NNS through/IN out/IN the/DT dish/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN that/IN accompanies/NNS the/DT rice/NN along/NN with/IN the/DT Queen/VBN Bee/NNP BBQ/NNP sauce/JJ really/RB set/VB it/PRP apart/VB from/IN other/JJ fried/JJ rice/NN dishes/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.
Two/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS had/VBD the/DT Cotswold/NNP Platter/NNP ./.
One/CD had/VBD the/DT Platter/NNP with/IN BBQ/NNP Pork/NNP and/CC BBQ/NNP tofu/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB the/DT hugest/JJS fan/NN of/IN tofu/NN but/CC this/DT had/VBD a/DT good/JJ taste/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB the/DT firm/NN type/NN of/IN tofu/NN but/CC held/VBD its/PRP$ ground/NN with/IN the/DT BBQ/NNP pork/NN ./.
The/DT sides/NNS that/IN they/PRP got/VBD were/VBD the/DT green/JJ beans/NNS and/CC Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN ./.
The/DT Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD very/RB runny/JJ and/CC she/PRP needed/VBD a/DT spoon/NN ./.
The/DT other/JJ Cotswold/NNP Platter/NNP had/VBD BBQ/VBN Chicken/NNP and/CC BBQ/NNP Pork/NNP ,/, Collard/NNP greens/NNS and/CC the/DT Jalapeño/NNP grits/NNS ./.
All/DT very/RB good/JJ choices/NNS ./.
My/NNP other/JJ friend/NN tried/IN the/DT other/JJ special/JJ the/DT Mac/NNP and/CC Cheese/NNP BBQ/NNP Burrito/NNP ./.
I/PRP got/VBD a/DT little/JJ taste/NN of/IN this/DT and/CC the/DT flavors/NNS work/NN so/RB well/RB together/RB ./.
Another/DT great/JJ thing/NN they/PRP got/VBD going/VBG on/IN is/VBZ a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN BBQ/NNP sauces/NNS ./.
My/NNP fav/NN from/IN the/DT options/NNS was/VBD the/DT Queen/VBN Bee/NN ./.
What/WP I/PRP can/MD remember/VB is/VBZ the/DT Tong/NNP 's/POS Thai/NNP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB runny/JJ sauce/NN that/WDT looks/NNS like/IN sweet/JJ chili/NN sauce/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD torn/JJ between/IN the/DT special/JJ and/CC The/DT BBQ/NNP salad/NN so/IN I/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO return/NN and/CC try/VB the/DT salad/JJ and/CC perhaps/RB some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ monthly/JJ specials/NNS ./.
First/NNP stamp/NN on/IN my/PRP$ EatWorkPlay/NNP Charlotte/NNP food/NN passport/NN !/.
My/NNP second/VBD visit/NN to/TO Improper/NNP Pig/NNP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB my/JJ out/NN of/IN town/NN guests/NNS and/CC the/DT runaway/NN favorite/NN was/VBD their/PRP$ chao/NN bao/NN taco/NN with/IN green/JJ beans/NNS ./.
Seriously/RB ,/, do/VBP n't/RB even/RB consider/VB getting/NNS anything/NN else/RB ,/, just/RB order/IN it/PRP and/CC go/VB home/NN happy/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD for/IN lunch/NN on/IN a/DT random/NN Monday/NNP and/CC had/VBD the/DT entire/JJ patio/NN to/TO ourselves/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD perfect/JJ for/IN an/DT 18-month/JJ old/JJ to/TO wander/NN around/NNS and/CC not/RB get/VB into/IN trouble/NN ./.
Our/NNP waiter/NN could/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN more/JJR friendly/JJ and/CC accommodating/NN ,/, so/RB five/CD stars/NNS for/IN service/NN ./.
While/IN Cotswold/NNP may/MD not/RB come/VB to/TO mind/NN as/IN a/DT Charlotte/JJ food/NN destination/NN hotspot/NN ,/, Improper/NNP Pig/NNP helped/VBD put/VBN the/DT Queen/NNP City/NNP on/IN the/DT map/NN with/IN their/PRP$ DDD/NNP feature/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP plenty/NN of/IN options/NNS for/IN BBQ/NNP around/NNP ,/, including/VBG my/NN favorites/NNS Midwood/NNP Smokehouse/NNP and/CC City/NNP Barbeque/NNP ,/, but/CC Improper/NNP Pig/NNP can/MD scratch/VB a/DT different/JJ itch/NN with/IN Asian/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
Easy/NNP to/TO recommend/VB and/CC nice/VB to/TO get/VB to/TO a/DT neighborhood/NN that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB normally/RB frequent/JJ ./.
There/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN hype/NN around/IN Improper/NNP Pig/NNP ,/, so/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO go/VB and/CC try/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
With/IN that/DT said/NN ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ what/WP all/PDT the/DT hype/NN is/VBZ about/IN ./.
The/DT BBQ/NNP is/VBZ ok/JJ ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN much/JJ better/NNS in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.
The/DT grits/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ,/, I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD them/PRP ./.
The/DT baked/JJ beans/NNS were/VBD n't/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB even/RB put/VB my/PRP$ finger/NN on/IN what/WP was/VBD wrong/JJ with/IN it/PRP but/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB tasty/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
My/NNP husband/NN had/VBD the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP good/JJ there/NN and/CC the/DT beer/NN selection/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD go/VB back/RB again/RB and/CC try/RB something/NN different/JJ ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT BBQ/NNP there/EX are/VBP better/JJR places/NNS in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.
I/PRP really/VBP wanted/JJ to/TO like/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Been/NNP wanting/NN to/TO go/VB since/IN it/PRP opened/-NONE- ,/, and/CC talked/VBD my/RP son/JJ out/IN of/IN going/VBG to/TO Outback/NNP for/IN ribs/NNS ,/, to/TO instead/RB try/VB this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
Sorry/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, that/WDT Outback/NNP has/VBZ their/PRP$ ribs/NNS beat/VBP ./.
Dry/NNP ,/, smoked/VBD ,/, sauce/RB less/JJR ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, I/PRP get/VBP that/IN the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT table/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD add/VB at/IN free/JJ will/NNS ,/, but/CC why/WRB not/RB make/VB a/DT traditional/JJ rib/NN with/IN BBQ/NNP sauce/NN for/IN those/DT who/NNS do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO try/VB 6/RB different/JJ sauces/NNS to/TO find/VB one/CD ?/.
Kids/NNS will/MD want/VB a/DT BBQ/NNP sauce/NN rib/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB taste/VB smoky/NN ./.
Some/DT adults/NNS might/MD too/RB ./.
The/DT jalapeño/NN cheese/NN grits/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS and/CC Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN were/VBD too/RB ./.
Nothing/NN exceptional/JJ ,/, but/CC tasted/VBN good/JJ ./.
Collards/NNS were/VBD not/RB my/JJ thing/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD attentive/JJ ./.
Dimmer/NNP lighting/NN might/MD be/VB nice/RB ./.
Tables/NNS are/VBP so/RB close/JJ together/NNS that/WDT something/NN has/VBZ to/TO help/VB the/DT ambience/NN so/RB lighting/VBG would/MD go/VB a/DT long/JJ way/NN ./.
With/IN some/DT work/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD give/VB them/PRP another/DT shot/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT improper/NN pig/NN a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ and/CC you/PRP get/VB a/DT lot/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ disappointing/NN item/NN was/VBD the/DT slaw/NN ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT choice/NN of/IN six/CD sauces/NNS too/RB ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC attentive/JJ without/IN hovering/NN ./.
Overall/IN a/DT good/JJ experience/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ slow/NN despite/IN the/DT restaurant/JJ being/VBG relatively/RB empty/NN ./.
Our/NNP waitress/NN disappeared/VBD for/IN a/DT while/NN so/RB another/DT waitress/NN had/VBD to/TO refill/NN our/PRP$ water/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD n't/RB a/DT big/JJ deal/NN ./.
She/PRP sure/VBD did/VBD hustle/NN when/WRB we/PRP asked/VBP for/IN the/DT check/NN though/IN !/.
She/PRP waited/VBD right/RB near/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ as/IN we/PRP signed/VBP our/VBN bill/tipped/VBD on/IN the/DT credit/NN card/NN slip/NN ./.
Oh/NNP well/RB .../:
Anyway/NNP ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB .../JJ blah/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD their/PRP$ BBQ/NN meatloaf/NN that/WDT was/VBD on/IN special/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS &/CC cheese/NN grits/NNS ./.
My/NNP meatloaf/NN was/VBD very/RB a/DT small/JJ portion/NN &/CC extremely/RB dry/JJ &/CC thin-/JJ for/IN $/$ 11/CD at/IN a/DT BBQ/NNP joint/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD expect/VB to/TO get/VB a/DT decent/NN serving/VBG size/NN ./.
The/DT cheese/NN grits/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC oh/JJ my/NN goodness/NN ,/, those/DT sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS they/PRP served/VBD me/PRP were/VBD absolutely/RB awful/JJ !/.
The/DT consistency/NN was/VBD grainy/JJ &/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB taste/VB like/IN any/DT sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ what/WP they/PRP mixed/VBP in/RP with/IN the/DT potatoes/NNS but/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD more/RBR like/IN refried/VBN beans/NNS that/IN you/PRP 'd/MD get/VB from/IN a/DT Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN also/RB agreed/VBD they/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB bad/JJ ./.
Even/RB if/IN I/PRP did/VBD want/VB to/TO eat/VB it/PRP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD extremely/RB hot/JJ &/CC did/VBD n't/RB even/RB cool/VB down/IN before/IN we/PRP left/VBP the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN had/VBD a/DT couple/NN different/JJ tacos/NNS &/CC said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD mediocre/NN at/IN best/JJS ./.
I/PRP really/VBP wanted/JJ to/TO like/IN this/DT place/NN since/IN everyone/NN was/VBD so/RB nice/JJ &/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT cute/JJ ,/, cool/JJ little/JJ place/NN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB we/PRP 'll/MD be/VB coming/VBG back/RB anytime/JJ soon/RB ./.
With/IN so/RB many/JJ great/JJ places/NNS to/TO get/VB BBQ/NNP in/IN CLT/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP need/VBP to/TO majorly/RB step/VB their/PRP$ game/NN up/IN !/CD
Great/NNP food/NN ,/, great/JJ concept/NN and/CC great/JJ .../: .superb/NN sides/NNS !/.
Only/RB one/CD issue/NN with/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, they/PRP need/VBP to/TO step/VB up/RP their/PRP$ beer/NN game/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP that/IN they/PRP have/VBP a/DT large/JJ selection/NN of/IN cans/NNS but/CC they/PRP are/VBP often/RB out/IN of/IN popular/JJ selections/NNS or/CC lack/NN variety/NN ./.
The/DT cheese/NN grits/NNS are/VBP the/DT best/JJS in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT pulled/JJ chicken/NN sandwich/NN with/IN chips/NNS for/IN delivery/NN using/VBG postmates/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD super/JJ fast/NN ./.
The/DT chips/NNS are/VBP delicious/JJ and/CC the/DT sandwich/NN is/VBZ super/NN fulfilling/NN ./.
Postmates/NNP delivery/NN fees/NNS are/VBP usually/RB too/RB pricey/JJ ,/, but/CC for/IN the/DT improper/NN pig/NN it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB $/$ 4/CD ./.
So/RB convenient/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ my/VBG first/JJ time/NN trying/VBG the/DT improper/NN pig/NN 's/POS food/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBD it/PRP ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB wait/VB to/TO try/VB more/JJR items/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD rate/VB this/DT bbq/NN as/IN just/RB ok/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD little/JJ dry/NN and/CC adding/VBG sauce/NN was/VBD essential/JJ to/TO ribs/NNS ,/, pulled/VBD pork/NN ,/, and/CC brisket/NN ./.
They/PRP gave/VBD you/PRP a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN and/CC the/DT price/NN was/VBD fair/JJ ./.
The/DT full/JJ bar/NN is/VBZ good/JJ and/CC the/DT cocktail/NN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD decent/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ not/RB really/RB much/JJ atmosphere/RB inside/NN ,/, but/CC bbq/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB known/VB for/IN being/VBG a/DT trendy/NN place/NN ./.
The/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/JJ side/NN was/VBD actually/RB gross/JJ as/IN it/PRP had/VBD this/DT weird/NN bbq/NN sauce/JJ taste/NN in/IN it/PRP so/RB I/PRP only/RB tried/VBD one/CD spoonful/JJ of/IN it/PRP and/CC gave/VBD up/RP on/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT improper/NN nachos/VBZ appetizer/NN was/VBD not/RB well/RB executed/VBN either/NN since/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB even/RB nachos/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD greasy/JJ potato/NN chips/NNS covered/VBD in/IN cheese/NN so/RB give/VBZ that/IN one/CD a/DT pass/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP live/VBP in/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN ,/, literally/RB just/RB around/IN the/DT corner/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD in/IN a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN with/IN my/PRP$ partner/NN and/CC two/CD of/IN our/PRP$ friends/NNS ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD packed/VBN but/CC we/PRP luckily/RB got/VBD a/DT seat/NN within/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS !/.
The/DT one/CD disappointment/NN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD was/VBD that/IN it/PRP took/VBD 15/CD minutes/NNS for/IN anyone/NN to/TO recognize/VB that/IN we/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN waited/VBN on/IN ,/, yet/RB ./.
At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD all/DT hungry/JJ and/CC thirsty/JJ (/NN as/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB waters/NNS ,/, not/RB were/VBD we/PRP able/JJ to/TO place/NN our/NNS adult/NN beverage/NN orders/NNS )/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Bahn/NNP Mi/NNP and/CC my/NNP mouth/NN was/VBD happily/RB on/IN fire/NN !/NN !/.
The/DT seasoning/NN and/CC taste/NN to/TO that/DT sandwich/JJ were/VBD perfect/NN ./.

We/PRP went/VBD here/RB for/IN dinner/NN on/IN a/DT weekday/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB busy/JJ so/IN we/PRP got/VBD seated/VBN at/IN a/DT high/JJ top/JJ communal/NN table/JJ ./.

-Cotswold/JJ platter/NN --/: -this/NN was/VBD a/DT normal/JJ bbq/NN platter/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB close/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ house/NN because/IN I/PRP 'd/MD have/VB a/DT haaaard/NN time/NN not/RB going/VBG all/DT the/DT time/NN if/IN it/PRP were/VBD ./.

The/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ,/, the/DT brisket/JJ the/DT same/JJ though/IN a/DT little/JJ fatty/NN ,/, the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, stay/JJ away/NN from/IN the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN ,/, and/CC do/VBP n't/RB sit/VB at/IN the/DT high/JJ tables/NNS ./.
For/IN an/DT in-depth/JJ review/NN ,/, keep/NNP reading/NNP ./.
The/DT Meal/NNP I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Cotswold/NNP Platter/NNP ,/, which/WDT consisted/VBN of/IN 2/CD meats/NNS and/CC 2/CD sides/NNS ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT brisket/NN (/NN which/WDT happened/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT slightly-shady/NN extra/VB $/$ 4/CD ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'll/VBP talk/JJ about/IN that/IN more/JJR later/JJ )/NN and/CC the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN for/IN my/PRP$ meats/NNS ./.
The/DT sides/NN available/JJ were/VBD pretty/RB varied/JJ ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ first/JJ choice/NN was/VBD the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN (/IN what/WP I/PRP believe/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT staple/NN in/IN any/DT good/JJ BBQ/NN restaurant/NN )/NN ./.
For/IN my/PRP$ second/JJ side/NN ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN ,/, something/NN I/PRP had/VBD never/RB heard/VBN of/IN and/CC was/VBD interested/JJ in/IN ./.
We/PRP 'll/VBP start/VBN with/IN the/DT meats/NNS :/: The/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP found/VBN that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP hard/JJ to/TO please/NN with/IN pulled/JJ pork/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT really/NN hit/VBD the/DT spot/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ and/CC moist/RB enough/RB that/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB require/VB any/DT sauce/NN to/TO eat/VB (/IN I/PRP like/IN the/DT flavor/NN of/IN good/JJ barbecue/NN without/IN dousing/NN it/PRP in/IN sauce/JJ )/NN ./.
Quite/RB possibly/RB the/DT best/JJS pulled/JJ pork/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.
The/DT beef/NN brisket/NN ,/, while/IN a/DT little/NN on/IN the/DT fatty/NN side/NN ,/, was/VBD also/RB delicious/JJ ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ brisket/NN in/IN Charlotte/NNP still/RB comes/VBZ from/IN Lancaster/NNP BBQ/NNP ,/, but/CC this/DT was/VBD a/DT close/JJ second/NN ./.
Improper/NNP 's/POS version/NN is/VBZ more/RBR pulled/JJ than/IN sliced/JJ ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ change/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD good/JJ enough/NN to/TO eat/VB by/IN itself/PRP ./.
The/DT extra/JJ fat/NN took/VBD it/PRP down/IN a/DT slight/NN notch/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT flavor/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
With/IN the/DT meats/NNS ,/, there/EX are/VBP 5/JJ or/CC 6/RB different/JJ options/NNS for/IN sauces/NNS ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT Thai/NNP sauce/NN ,/, mustard/NN BBQ/NN ,/, regular/JJ BBQ/NNP (/NNP tomato/NN )/NN ,/, Eastern/NNP NC/NNP BBQ/NNP (/NNP vinegar/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC Frank/NNP 's/POS Redhot/NNP (/NNP I/PRP forget/VBP if/IN there/EX 's/VBZ another/DT )/NN ./.
The/DT Thai/NNP was/VBD sweet/JJ with/IN a/DT little/JJ spice/NN ,/, very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT mustard/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ my/VBG favorite/JJ usually/NN ,/, was/VBD very/RB good/JJ here/NN also/RB ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT sides/NNS ,/, the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/RB ,/, but/CC a/DT strong/JJ staple/NN and/CC something/NN I/PRP would/MD order/VB again/RB ./.
A/DT little/JJ more/RBR saucy/JJ than/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT baked/JJ versions/NNS you/PRP 'll/MD find/VB at/IN other/JJ BBQ/NNP joints/NNS ,/, but/CC good/JJ none-the-less/NN ./.
The/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, was/VBD a/DT disappointment/NN ./.
My/NNP coworkers/NNS and/CC I/PRP all/DT agreed/NN that/IN we/PRP could/MD definitely/RB have/VB done/VBN without/IN it/PRP ./.
What/WP it/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB was/VBD a/DT version/NN of/IN sweet/JJ potato/NN casserole/NN without/IN brown/JJ sugar/NN ;/: a/DT bland/NN mash/NN ,/, maybe/NN slightly/RB bitter/JJ ,/, with/IN no/DT real/JJ redeeming/VBG quality/NN unfortunately/RB ./.
The/DT meal/NN also/RB came/VBD with/IN what/WP looked/VBN like/IN a/DT cornbread/JJ cookie/NN and/CC some/DT red/VBN onions/NNS (/VBP maybe/NN pickled/VBD onions/NNS ?/.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB try/VB them/PRP ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD they/PRP were/VBD maybe/JJ just/RB for/IN show/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT cornbread/NN was/VBD alright/RB ,/, it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/VB add/NNS or/CC detract/VB from/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
But/CC then/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP used/VBN to/TO a/DT larger/JJR portion/NN of/IN moist/NN cornbread/NN ,/, maybe/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN honey/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP might/MD just/RB be/VB spoiled/VBN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT meal/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, with/IN one/CD regrettable/JJ side/NN choice/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD otherwise/VB order/NN it/PRP again/RB ./.
Good/NNP flavors/NNS and/CC good/JJ portions/NNS ./.
The/DT Rest/NNP The/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD nicely/RB decorated/VBN ,/, the/DT kitchen/NN is/VBZ open/JJ and/CC visible/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP felt/VBD appropriate/NN for/IN a/DT nicer/NN BBQ/NN restaurant/NN ./.
Not/RB much/JJ to/TO talk/NN about/IN ,/, save/JJ for/IN two/CD things/NNS ./.
One/CD ,/, they/PRP should/MD put/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN blinds/NNS or/CC window/VB covering/NN on/IN the/DT larger/NN windows/VBZ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ darker/JJ inside/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT outside/JJ light/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ blinding/NN ./.
Two/CD ,/, they/PRP need/VBP to/TO get/VB nicer/JJ chairs/NNS for/IN the/DT high/JJ tables/NNS ./.
The/DT chairs/NNS they/PRP have/VBP seem/VBN to/TO be/VB there/RB for/IN looks/NNS more/JJR than/IN functionality/NN ./.

As/IN someone/NN with/IN just/RB enough/JJ graphic/JJ design/NN understanding/NN to/TO get/VB himself/PRP in/IN trouble/NN ,/, the/DT menu/NN made/VBD me/PRP cringe/VBP a/DT bit/NN ./.

Once/IN you/PRP can/MD figure/VB out/RP where/WRB everything/NN is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB hard/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN it/PRP should/MD n't/RB be/VB that/IN hard/JJ to/TO read/VB a/DT one/CD page/NN menu/NN ./.
Not/RB a/DT big/JJ deal/NN ,/, just/RB a/DT random/NN quirk/NN ./.
Do/NNP pay/VBD attention/NN though/IN to/TO the/DT prices/NNS ./.
The/DT menu/NN does/VBZ a/DT poor/JJ job/NN of/IN letting/VBG you/PRP know/VB about/IN extra/JJ costs/NNS ./.
The/DT brisket/NN is/VBZ apparently/RB an/DT extra/JJ $/NN 4/CD ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP assuming/VBG for/IN all/DT entrees/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB immediately/RB apparent/VB to/TO me/PRP ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP still/RB reading/JJ ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT trooper/NN :/: -/JJ )/NNS To/VBP finish/JJ this/DT book/NN ,/, after/IN my/PRP$ lunch/NN experience/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD most/VB likely/JJ be/VB heading/VBG back/RB to/TO The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP ,/, but/CC with/IN a/DT better/JJR understanding/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, the/DT cost/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT seating/NN ./.

Kids/NNP had/VBD pulled/VBN pork/NN sammys/NNS with/IN Mac/NNP n/NNP cheese/NN ./.
Sammys/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ./.
Mac/NNP n/NNP cheese/NN was/VBD grainy/NN if/IN that/DT 's/VBZ a/DT word/NN ./.
Like/IN the/DT flour/NN did/VBD n't/RB have/VB time/VBN to/TO dissolve/VB or/CC something/NN ./.
Could/NNP have/VBP used/VBN more/JJR kick/NN or/CC sharpness/NN too/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT BBQ/NNP charcuterie/NN plate/NN and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN Brussels/NNS sprouts/NNS ./.
At/IN $/$ 18/CD I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN at/IN how/WRB small/JJ the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD ./.
Scratch/NN that/IN ./.
Disappointed/NNP ./.
Came/NN with/IN andouille/JJ sausage/NN ,/, brisket/NN ,/, pulled/VBD pork/NN and/CC 2/CD ribs/NNS and/CC a/DT teeny/NN tiny/NN corn/NN muffin/NN ,/, some/DT orange/NN stuff/NN that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ about/RB ,/, cole/NN slaw/NN and/CC some/DT very/RB good/JJ house/NN made/VBD potato/NN chips/NNS ./.
LOVED/NNP the/DT ribs/NNS ./.
Very/NNP good/JJ flavor/NN and/CC texture/NN and/CC color/NN ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT highlight/NN ./.
Second/NNP was/VBD the/DT sausage/NN which/WDT surprised/VBN me/PRP since/IN I/PRP normally/RB do/VBP do/VBP smoked/VBN sausage/NN ./.
Brisket/NNP was/VBD cut/VBN too/RB thin/JJ and/CC was/VBD dry/JJ ./.
Would/NNP n't/RB recommend/VB ./.
Pulled/JJ pork/NN was/VBD ok./JJ Not/RB much/JJ flavor/NN ./.
Cole/NNP slaw/VBD might/MD as/RB well/RB have/VB come/VBN from/IN the/DT prepared/JJ food/NN aisle/NN at/IN Harris/NNP Teeter/NNP ./.
The/DT Brussels/NNS sprouts/NNS were/VBD oh/JJ so/RB disappointing/JJ ./.

Too/NNP much/RB pepper/JJR ./.
With/IN all/PDT the/DT great/JJ meats/NNS in/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, no/DT clue/NN why/IN they/PRP sprouts/NNS are/VBP n't/RB served/VBN more/JJR al/JJ dente/NN with/IN bacon/NN or/CC pulled/JJ pork/NN and/CC some/DT carmelization/NN ./.

Anyway/NNP ./.
Nice/NNP selection/NN of/IN sauces/NNS on/IN the/DT table/JJ ,/, including/VBG a/DT couple/NN that/WDT are/VBP Asian/JJ themed/JJ ./.
Only/RB issue/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP odd/VBN caps/NNS on/IN the/DT sauces/NNS which/WDT makes/VBZ the/DT sauce/JJ dribble/JJ out/NN and/CC all/DT over/IN the/DT bottle/NN making/VBG them/PRP sticky/JJ and/CC sort/NN of/IN gross/NNS ./.
The/DT bring/NN regular/JJ napkins/NNS to/TO the/DT table/JJ but/CC BBQ/NNP needs/VBD a/DT strong/JJ paper/NN towel/NN ./.
Napkins/NNP do/VBP n't/RB do/VB ./.
And/CC considering/VBG the/DT sticky/JJ sauces/NNS ,/, some/DT wet/JJ wipes/NNS would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ touch/NN too/RB ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT I/PRP would/MD come/VB back/RB but/CC specifically/RB for/IN the/DT ribs/NNS and/CC chips/NNS ./.

So/IN many/JJ things/NNS I/PRP want/VBP to/TO try/NN on/IN this/DT menu/NN !/.
The/DT BBQ/NNP sauces/NNS are/VBP all/DT great/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT honey/NN mustard/NN and/CC the/DT spicy/NN one/CD (/NN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO ask/VB for/IN from/IN the/DT fridge/NN )/NNS were/VBD my/VBN favorite/JJ ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP split/VB the/DT meat/NN sampler/NN and/CC a/DT burger/NN ./.

Every/NNP employee/NN who/WP walked/VBN by/IN us/PRP ,/, offered/VBD to/TO help/NNP and/CC made/VBD sure/JJ everything/NN was/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ liking/NN ./.
Service/NNP trumps/NNS EVERYTHING/VBP to/TO me/PRP ./.
Anyone/NNP can/MD make/VB great/JJ food/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN there/EX is/VBZ n't/RB good/JJ service/NN to/TO deliver/NN that/IN food/NN ,/, nobody/NN wants/VBZ to/TO eat/VB there/RB !/.
That/DT being/VBG said/VBN ,/, we/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN !/.
The/DT nachos/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP came/VBD out/RP super/NN fast/NN and/CC were/VBD yummy/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB LOVE/VB them/PRP ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD good/JJ ./.
They/PRP had/VBD melted/VBN pimento/NN cheese/NN and/CC brisket/NN on/IN them/PRP .../: so/RB .../: enough/NNP said/VBD !/.
We/PRP both/VBP got/VBN the/DT Cotswald/NNP Platter/NNP ,/, getting/VBG the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN and/CC mac/NN 'n/NNS '/POS cheese/NN !/.
John/NNP also/RB got/VBD the/DT Cheesy/NNP Jalapeno/NNP Grits/NNP (/NNP think/NNP Flying/NNP Biscuit/NNP 's/POS creamy/NN dreamy/NN grits/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT little/JJ kick/NN !/NN )/.
and/CC I/PRP got/VBD the/DT brussel/NN sprouts/NNS ,/, hoping/VBG that/IN it/PRP would/MD help/VB balance/NN out/IN all/PDT the/DT not-so-healthy/JJ food/NN I/PRP was/VBD planning/VBG to/TO induldge/VB with/IN !/.
Everything/NN was/VBD super/NN tasty/NN here/RB ./.
We/PRP will/MD certainly/RB be/VB back/RB .../: unless/IN our/PRP$ resolution/NN to/TO lose/VB weight/NN and/CC be/VB healthier/JJ (/NNS ha/NN )/VBZ actually/RB goes/VBZ into/IN effect/NN !/.
O/NNP .../: Ver/NNP .../NNP ..Priced/VBD ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT largest/JJS single/JJ plate/NN of/IN food/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN for/IN $/$ 14/CD ,/, expecting/VBG to/TO split/VB it/PRP with/IN my/PRP$ 18mo/CD old/JJ and/CC she/PRP at/IN the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD such/JJ a/DT small/JJ portion/NN of/IN food/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN itself/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC not/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN Mac/NNP 's/POS ,/, Midwood/NNP Smokehouse/NNP ,/, Sauceman/NNP 's/POS or/CC even/RB Moe/NNP 's/POS in/IN Matthews/NNP ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP accounted/VBD for/IN maybe/NN 75/CD %/NN of/IN their/PRP$ business/NN in/IN the/DT off/JJ hours/NNS ./.
So/RB not/RB a/DT true/JJ test/NN ./.
Bonus/NNP :/: It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT only/RB place/RB this/DT far/NN that/IN serves/NNS pork/VBP and/CC slaw/VB egg/JJ rolls/NNS ./.
Worthy/NNP of/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ price/NN at/IN $/$ 4/CD ./.
Bottom/NNP line/NN ./.
The/DT Improper/NNP pig/NN would/MD be/VB a/DT huge/JJ hit/NN if/IN it/PRP were/VBD located/VBN in/IN a/DT place/NN without/IN such/JJ stellar/JJ BBQ/NNP -/NN like/IN the/DT Midwest/NN ./.
But/CC in/IN CLT/NNP ,/, it/PRP falls/VBZ to/TO the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT list/NN due/JJ to/TO it/PRP 's/VBZ high/JJ prices/NNS for/IN small/JJ portion/NN of/IN average/JJ food/NN ./.
My/NNP family/NN and/CC I/PRP found/VBD out/RP about/IN this/DT restaurent/NN on/IN Groupon/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD so/RB great/JJ ./.
Food/NNP and/CC Service/NNP ./.
We/PRP order/VBP the/DT platter/NN and/CC chag/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT price/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD actually/RB surprised/VBN how/WRB big/JJ the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD and/CC it/PRP made/VBD it/PRP definitely/RB worth/VBD the/DT price/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP specials/NNS everyday/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ place/NN for/IN my/NN 20/CD month/NN old/JJ too/RB ./.
Hint/NN :/: the/DT closing/JJ time/NN on/IN Saturday/NNP is/VBZ 11pm/CD but/CC they/PRP started/VBD cleaning/VBG all/DT around/NN us/PRP to/TO go/VB for/IN closing/JJ around/NN 9:30pm/CD ./.
It/PRP felt/VBD kind/NN of/IN weird/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, my/PRP$ hint/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB sure/JJ you/PRP go/VB and/CC end/VB your/PRP$ meal/NN 1hr/CD and/CC 30mins/CD prior/NN to/TO closing/JJ time/NN ./.
Similar/JJ to/TO baseball/NN i/NN like/IN to/TO give/VB a/DT restaurant/NN three/CD trys/NNS before/IN finally/RB making/VBG a/DT decision/NN wether/NN i/NN like/IN the/DT place/NN or/CC not/RB ./.
The/DT first/JJ two/CD times/NNS we/PRP came/VBD we/PRP had/VBD the/DT same/JJ server/NN ./.
She/PRP was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Attentive/JJ ,/, fast/NN and/CC clearly/RB knew/VBD the/DT menu/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD not/RB the/DT case/NN with/IN our/PRP$ server/NN today/NN ./.
After/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP food/NN ,/, our/PRP$ server/NN didnt/NN return/NN to/TO the/DT table/JJ until/IN our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD up/RB ./.
Which/NNP usually/NNP is/VBZ fine/NN but/CC our/PRP$ food/NN took/VBD so/RB long/RB that/IN i/NN was/VBD sipping/VBG on/IN melted/VBN ice/NN by/IN then/RB ./.
I/PRP then/RB had/VBD to/TO ask/NN for/IN more/JJR soda/NN ./.
After/IN that/DT our/NN server/NN stood/VBD in/IN plain/NN sight/NN talking/VBG with/IN some/DT other/JJ servers/NNS until/IN Ann/NNP (/VBD the/DT server/NN we/PRP had/VBD the/DT first/JJ two/CD times/NNS )/RB came/VBD up/RP and/CC cleared/VBD our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC asked/VBD jill/NN our/PRP$ actually/RB server/NN to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ bill/NN together/RB ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN food/NN goes/VBZ some/DT things/NNS are/VBP good/JJ and/CC others/NNS are/VBP eh/JJ .../:
The/DT salmon/JJ i/NN had/VBD last/JJ time/NN was/VBD cook/JJ perfectly/RB and/CC seasoned/VBN well/RB ./.
The/DT collards/NNS i/VBP didnt/JJ care/NN for/IN but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP vegetarian/JJ ./.

I/PRP mixed/VBP the/DT pickled/JJ onion/NN into/IN it/PRP with/IN a/DT little/JJ salt/NN and/CC pepper/NN ./.
Made/NNP it/PRP so/RB much/RB better/JJR ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN bang/NN for/IN your/PRP$ buck/NN goes/VBZ ./.
Its/PRP$ pretty/NN average/JJ i/NN seen/NN alot/NN of/IN reviews/NNS saying/VBG the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD small/JJ for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
That/DT was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ impression/NN but/CC after/IN almost/RB cleaning/VBG my/PRP$ plate/NN i/NN was/VBD full/JJ ./.
I/PRP may/MD give/VB this/DT place/NN one/CD last/JJ shot/NN .../:
My/NNP fiancé/NN and/CC I/PRP just/RB moved/VBD from/IN uptown/JJ Charlotte/NNS to/TO Cotswold/NNP and/CC decided/VBD to/TO finally/RB check/VB this/DT place/NN out/IN ./.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT jalapeño/NN appetizer/NN and/CC although/IN it/PRP was/VBD smaller/JJR than/IN we/PRP thought/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD still/RB very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD probably/RB order/VB something/NN else/RB next/JJ time/NN for/IN an/DT app/NN ,/, though/IN ,/, only/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT size/NN ./.
We/PRP split/VBD the/DT Improper/NNP Charcuterie/NNP board/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
The/DT pimento/NN cheese/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ with/IN it/PRP .../-NONE- ./. um/NN hellllooo/NN ?/. !/.

They/PRP were/VBD so/RB good-/JJ nothing/NN else/RB I/PRP had/VBD could/MD live/VB up/RB to/TO them/PRP !/.
Since/IN it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ visit/NN I/PRP just/RB wanted/VBD to/TO start/NNS with/IN the/DT basics-/NN a/DT barbecue/NN platter/NN ./.
The/DT best/JJS sauce/JJ offering/NN and/CC cole/NN slaw/NN were/VBD both/DT Asian/JJ inspired-/NN I/PRP suspect/VBP these/DT are/VBP the/DT true/JJ strengths/NNS of/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
Other/JJ items/NNS I/PRP had/VBD seemed/VBN to/TO rely/RB too/RB much/RB on/IN heat/NN spice/NN for/IN flavoring/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD overwhelming/VBG ./.
Collards/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC far/RB too/RB spicy/JJ ./.
Pickled/NNP onions/NNS too/RB strong/JJ ./.
More/NNP spice/NN in/IN the/DT cornbread/NN ./.
And/CC with/IN vinegar/NN based/VBN BBQ/NNP sauces/VBZ -/JJ it/PRP was/VBD all/DT just/RB too/RB many/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
Sweet/NNP potato/NNP hash/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB what/WP I/PRP was/VBD expecting-/JJ this/DT is/VBZ more/RBR mashed/JJ potato/NN than/IN hashbrowns/NNS (/VBP It/PRP also/RB contained/VBD meat/NN )/NNS ./.
All/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ ,/, but/CC quick/RB serve/JJ meant/NN not/RB everything/NN was/VBD terribly/RB warm/NN ./.
Over/IN all/DT good/JJ experience/NN and/CC would/MD go/VB back/RB to/TO focus/VB on/IN more/JJR of/IN the/DT Asian/JJ items/NNS ./.
Oh/NNP and/CC of/IN course/NN those/DT nachos/NNS !/.

Food/NNP is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC so/RB is/VBZ the/DT staff/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC place/NN is/VBZ a/DT rip/NN off/NN ./.

Just/RB left/VBN their/PRP$ fans/NNS had/VBD lunch/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP starving/VBG ./.

The/DT jalapeño/NN cheese/NN grits/NNS were/VBD outstanding/JJ as/IN were/VBD the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.

The/DT kale/NN chips/NNS also/RB made/VBD me/PRP nauseous/JJ for/IN a/DT day/NN and/CC a/DT half/NN after/IN eating/VBG them/PRP ./.

I/PRP 'll/MD have/VB to/TO update/JJ this/DT review/NN after/IN the/DT actual/JJ event/NN ,/, but/CC so/RB far/RB we/PRP love/VB The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP more/JJR than/IN vegetarians/NNS should/MD and/CC we/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP them/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ catering/NN needs/NNS !/.
UPDATE/NNP :/: Improper/NNP Pig/NNP really/RB came/VBD through/IN for/IN us/PRP on/IN the/DT wedding/JJ day/NN !/.
Some/DT of/IN our/PRP$ guests/NNS had/VBD strong/JJ opinions/NNS about/IN our/PRP$ vegetarian/JJ wedding/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD all/DT said/VBN and/CC done/JJ we/PRP got/VBD nothing/NN but/CC compliments/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT vegetarian/NN and/CC do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN Improper/NNP Pig/NNP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ spot/NN for/IN you/PRP ,/, I/PRP say/VBP TRY/NNP IT/NNP !/.
A/DT friend/NN invited/VBD me/PRP out/IN to/TO Improper/NNP Pig/NNP for/IN Saturday/NNP dinner/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN Pork/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
After/IN wavering/NN between/IN the/DT salmon/NN and/CC the/DT ribs/NNS ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP going/VBG with/IN the/DT ribs/NNS with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN ./.
The/DT ribs/NNS were/VBD well/RB seasoned/VBN and/CC fell/VBD off/RP of/IN the/DT bone/NN ./.
They/PRP really/RB did/VBD n't/RB need/VB any/DT sauce/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP tried/VBD each/DT and/CC every/DT one/CD offered/NN ./.
The/DT sauces/NNS are/VBP Asian/JJ inspired/NN ,/, so/RB there/EX was/VBD no/DT basic/JJ BBQ/NNP sauce/NN ./.
Queen/NNP Bee/NNP -/JJ SWEET/NNP BBQ/NNP ;/: Mary/NNP 's/POS -/JJ taste/NN like/IN ketchup/NN ;/: Tong/NNP Tai/NNP -/JJ spicy/NN sweet/JJ vinaigrette/NN ;/: Eastern/NNP Vinegar/NNP -/JJ vinegar/NN w//VB a/DT kick/NN ;/: Spicy/NNP Hoilson/NNP -/JJ Spicy/NN Teryaki/NNP ;/: Mustard/NNP -/NNP any/DT other/JJ mustard/NN sause/NN ./.
I/PRP settled/VBD on/IN mixing/VBG the/DT Spicy/NNP Hoilson/NNP (/NNP which/WDT was/VBD best/JJ )/NN and/CC Queen/VBN Bee/NNP ./.
The/DT spicy/NN sauces/NNS are/VBP VERY/NNP spicy/NN ,/, so/RB be/VB prepared/VBN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN hash/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG something/NN sweet/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX were/VBD onions/NNS and/CC maybe/VB garlic/JJ mixed/NN in/IN ,/, which/WDT eliminated/-NONE- the/DT sweetness/NN and/CC overall/JJ I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
Just/NNP do/VBP n't/RB order/VB this/DT expecting/NN something/NN sweet/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN had/VBD their/PRP$ chocolate/NN cake/NN for/IN dessert/NN ,/, which/WDT she/PRP like/IN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT house/NN margarita/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD the/DT drink/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ./.
Their/NNP house/NNP margarita/NN is/VBZ actually/RB an/DT orange/JJ margarita/NN ,/, which/WDT my/-NONE- waitress/VBZ failed/VBN to/TO mention/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD okay/NN ./.
While/IN she/PRP was/VBD patient/JJ ,/, she/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN far/RB more/RBR informative/JJ ./.
Nevertheless/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT BBQ/NNP pork/NN restaurant/NN and/CC based/VBN on/IN that/IN ,/, I/PRP will/MD judge/VB it/PRP ./.
Thus/RB four/CD stars/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN BBQ/NNP ,/, the/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.
Thought/NNP it/PRP was/VBD surprisingly/RB good/JJ (/NN my/NN boyfriend/NN thinks/VBZ ``/`` city/NN people/NNS ''/'' doing/VBG good/JJ BBQ/NN is/VBZ unlikely/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT would/MD prove/VB him/PRP wrong/VB !/NNP )/.
The/DT greens/NNS were/VBD tender/RB ,/, the/DT sauces/NNS were/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN fun/JJ (/NN loved/VBD the/DT mustard/NN )/NN ,/, the/DT BBQ/NNP was/VBD lean/JJ and/CC tasty/NN ./.

A/DT very/JJ solid/JJ 4.5/CD stars/NNS ./.

Not/RB expressly/RB on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, we/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT combination/NN jalapeno/peach/NN margarita/NN ,/, it/PRP rocked/VBD ./.
This/DT BBQ/NN joint/VBZ serves/VBZ up/RP one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS eclectic/JJ menus/NNS in/IN Charlotte/NNP ,/, with/IN a/DT mix/NN of/IN Southern/NNP and/CC Asian/JJ influences/NNS ./.

But/CC the/DT 'Que/NN is/VBZ tasty/NN and/CC succulent/NN ,/, served/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT solid/JJ selection/NN of/IN craft/NN brews/NNS and/CC sides/NNS ./.
They/PRP might/MD rate/VB higher/JJR if/IN they/PRP stuck/VBP to/TO their/PRP$ knitting/NN ,/, but/CC every/DT once/NN in/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, it/PRP pays/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ different/NN ./.

House/NNP made/VBD salt/NN and/CC vinegar/NN chips/NNS with/IN house/NN made/VBN pimento/NN and/CC super/NN tender/NN and/CC smoked/VBD chicken/NN ./.
We/PRP took/VBD this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO sample/JJ all/PDT the/DT sauces/NNS which/WDT were/VBD great/JJ ./.
As/IN we/PRP were/VBD getting/VBG full/JJ we/PRP began/VBD thinking/VBG the/DT we/NN two/CD ladies/NNS would/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO consume/NN two/CD entrees/NNS ./.
Simmone/NNP to/TO the/DT rescue/NN ./.
She/PRP suggested/VBD we/PRP share/VBP a/DT platter/NN ./.
We/PRP split/VBD the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN platter/NN with/IN two/CD sides/NNS ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT amazing/JJ Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN and/CC Brussels/NNS sprouts/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB kidding/VBG ,/, the/DT sprouts/NNS beat/VBP the/DT Mac/NNP and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT dis/NN on/IN the/DT pasta/NN ./.
All/DT and/CC all/DT ,/, we/PRP had/VBD a/DT fantastic/JJ Saturday/NNP lunch/NN !/.
So/RB glad/RB we/PRP chose/VBP this/DT spot/NN with/IN so/RB many/JJ places/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO start/VB off/RP by/IN saying/VBG i/NN was/VBD super/NN excited/VBD to/TO try/VB a/DT new/JJ BBQ/NNP joint/NN especially/RB so/RB close/JJ to/TO home/NN ./.
Presentation/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC place/NN was/VBD very/RB clean/JJ and/CC kind/NN of/IN a/DT upscale/JJ bbq/NN joint/NN look/NN to/TO it/PRP and/CC the/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP fast/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD all/DT down/JJ hill/NN after/IN that/DT ./.
With/IN this/DT being/VBG my/NN first/JJ time/NN i/NN wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT sampler/NN so/RB i/JJ got/IN ``/`` The/DT Improper/NNP Charcuterie/NNP ''/'' which/WDT includes/-NONE- pulled/VBD pork/NN ,/, Brisket/NNP ,/, Ribs/NNP ,/, Andouille/NNP Sausage/NNP ,/, BBQ/NNP Chips/NNP ,/, Slaw/NNP and/CC pimento/NNP cheese/NN ./.
So/RB everyone/NN knows/VBZ you/PRP can/MD judge/VB a/DT BBQ/NN joint/NN by/IN their/PRP$ brisket/NN with/IN that/DT being/VBG said/VBD i/NN pulled/VBD the/DT brisket/NN piece/NN apart/NN and/CC tender/NN but/CC extremely/RB dry/JJ ,/, still/RB trying/VBG to/TO figure/VB out/RP how/WRB you/PRP can/MD have/VB a/DT tender/JJ piece/NN of/IN meat/NN and/CC be/VB so/RB dry/JJ ,/, the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT bark/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
The/DT pulled/VBD pork/NN had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ size/NN portion/NN and/CC good/JJ color/NN to/TO it/PRP but/CC extremely/RB dry/JJ even/RB with/IN the/DT sauces/NNS they/PRP give/VBP ./.
The/DT ribs/NNS {/RB 2/VBP bones/NNS }/VBP probably/RB the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN had/VBD good/JJ flavor/NN but/CC again/RB over/IN cooked/VBN and/CC they/PRP left/VBD the/DT membrane/NN skin/NN on/IN ./.
The/DT Andouille/NNP sausage/NN was/VBD ok/JJ at/IN best/JJS but/CC again/RB over/IN cooked/VBN ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP getting/VBG the/DT theme/NN here/RB ?/JJ ?/. ?/.
:/: )/JJ Pimento/NNP cheese/NN had/VBD some/DT weird/JJ after/NN taste/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.
Which/NNP was/VBD disappointing/VBG because/IN i/JJ absolutely/RB love/JJ pimento/NN cheese/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD like/IN 5/CD BBQ/NNP sauces/NNS that/WDT were/VBD Meh/NNP and/CC franks/VBZ hot/NN sauce/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT pricing/NN was/VBD pretty/RB steep/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
$/$ 24/CD for/IN a/DT full/JJ rack/NN of/IN ribs/NNS ,/, $/$ 22/CD for/IN a/DT 10/CD oz/NN ribeye/NN and/CC my/PRP$ platter/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/RB bad/JJ at/IN $/$ 16/CD ./.
On/IN a/DT bright/NN note/IN the/DT Slaw/NNP was/VBD good/JJ and/CC the/DT BBQ/NNP Chips/NNP had/VBD great/VBN flavor/NN but/CC then/RB again/RB basically/VB the/DT two/CD smallest/NN things/NNS on/IN the/DT platter/NN ./.
Verdict/NN :/: Sorry/NNP Improper/NNP Pig/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD be/VB driving/VBG the/DT extra/JJ 5/NN minutes/NNS over/IN to/TO Midwood/NNP Smokehouse/NNP to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ BBQ/NN and/CC the/DT best/JJS brisket/NN in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.
Went/NNP today/NN on/IN snow/JJ day/NN ,/, business/NN was/VBD slow/JJ to/TO be/VB expected/VBN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD great/VBN service/NN !/.

We/PRP first/RB checked/VBD out/IN The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP during/IN the/DT pre-grand/NN opening/VBG tasting/NN event/NN and/CC have/VBP since/VBN been/VBN back/RB on/IN a/DT fairly/NN regular/JJ basis/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP have/VBP some/DT room/NN to/TO improve/VB but/CC for/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ favorite/JJ bbq/NN places/NNS around/IN town/NN ./.
My/NNP personal/NNP favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT brisket/JJ sandwich/JJ quite/JJ literally/NN drowning/VBG in/IN a/DT sea/NN of/IN Korean/NNP bbq/NNP sauce/NN ,/, Spicy/NNP Housin/NNP ,/, or/CC the/DT very/RB best/JJ sauce/NN .../: Tongs/NNP Thai/NNP ./.

I/PRP went/VBD to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN with/IN my/PRP$ dad/NN on/IN a/DT visit/NN to/TO Charlotte/NNP ./.

The/DT meat/NN on/IN our/PRP$ burgers/NNS was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC cooked/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ desired/JJ level/NN of/IN doneness/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, my/VBZ ``/`` smoke/NN house/NN ''/'' burger/NN had/VBD almost/RB no/DT smokiness/NN ./.

With/IN some/DT more/RBR focus/NNS on/IN flavors/NNS ,/, this/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT very/RB good/JJ burger/NN place/NN but/CC it/PRP fell/VBD a/DT bit/NN short/NN in/IN my/PRP$ eyes/NNS ./.

Really/RB disappointed/VBD with/IN this/DT place/NN !/.
The/DT burgers/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ./.
Definitely/RB a/DT premium/NN burger/NN joint/NNS ,/, although/IN there/EX are/VBP a/DT couple/NN better/RBR places/NNS in/IN town/NN ./.
$/$ 12/CD for/IN a/DT burger/NN with/IN no/DT fries/NNS is/VBZ not/RB cool/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN though/IN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD TERRIBLE/NNP ./.
They/PRP messed/VBD up/RP a/DT burger/NN and/CC did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB to/TO care/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP asked/VBP for/IN lettuce/NN on/IN one/CD of/IN them/PRP they/PRP brought/VBD over/IN a/DT plate/NN with/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN lettuce/NN that/IN was/VBD LITERALLY/NNP the/DT size/NN of/IN a/DT baseball/JJ card/NN ./.
They/PRP ought/VBD to/TO be/VB embarrassed/VBN of/IN that/DT !/NN
Even/RB after/IN I/PRP said/VBD ``/`` you/PRP have/VBP got/VBN to/TO be/VB kidding/VBG ''/'' they/PRP defended/VBD the/DT small/JJ piece/NN they/PRP brought/VBD over/IN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP never/RB go/VB back/RB here/RB again/RB and/CC suggest/RB others/NNS do/VBP n't/RB waste/VB their/PRP$ time/NN or/CC money/NN ./.
Now/IN that/DT I/PRP 've/VBP moved/VBN to/TO Cotswald/NNP ,/, decided/VBD to/TO check/NN out/IN The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP tonight/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB opened/VBD in/IN December/NNP ./.
My/NNP dad/RB and/CC his/PRP$ wife/NN ,/, my/NNP wife/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB my/VB 14-month/JJ old/JJ son/NN were/VBD amazed/VBN at/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD 6/VBN sauces/NNS to/TO choose/VB from/IN (/NNP well/RB ,/, one/CD was/VBD Frank/NNP 's/POS Red/NNP Hot/NNP ,/, so/RB I/PRP guess/VBZ 5/JJ )/NN ./.
Mustard/NNP ,/, Eastern/NNP NC/NNP ,/, Western/NNP NC/NNP ,/, Spicy/NNP Hoisin/NNP ,/, and/CC Thai/NNP ./.
This/DT place/NN touts/VBZ itself/PRP as/IN an/DT Asian/JJ inspired/JJ BBQ/NNP joint/NNP ,/, and/CC does/VBZ well/RB at/IN just/RB that/IN without/IN pulling/VBG too/RB far/RB away/RB from/IN the/DT roots/NNS of/IN NC/NNP BBQ/NNP (/NNP and/CC other/JJ states/NNS ,/, too/RB )/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP must/MD recommend/VB if/IN you/PRP go/VBP there/RB ,/, the/DT Improper/NNP Charcuterie/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ basically/RB a/DT sampler/NN plate/NN ./.
You/PRP get/VBP pulled/VBN pork/NN ,/, andouille/JJ sausage/NN ,/, beef/NN brisket/NN ,/, St./NNP Louis/NNP style/NN ribs/NNS ,/, house/RB made/VBN salt/NN and/CC vinegar/NN chips/NNS with/IN pimento/NN cheese/NN to/TO dip/VB ,/, a/DT tiny/NN cornbread/JJ muffin/NN ,/, and/CC slaw/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ for/IN me/PRP to/TO pick/VB a/DT favorite/JJ meat/NN because/IN everything/NN was/VBD phenomenal/JJ ./.
And/CC the/DT sauces/NNS .../: oh/JJ ,/, the/DT sauces/NNS !/.
The/DT NC/NNP Eastern/NNP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN sweeter/JJR than/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP used/JJ to/TO ,/, but/CC still/RB had/VBD enough/RB spice/JJ and/CC a/DT prefect/NN pairing/VBG to/TO the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN ./.
The/DT NC/NNP Western/NNP had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ spicy/NN kick/NN ,/, more/RBR like/IN hot/NN Memphis/NNP sauce/NN actually/RB ,/, and/CC went/VBD perfectly/RB with/IN the/DT ribs/NNS ./.
The/DT mustard/NN was/VBD great/JJ (/NN though/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB have/VB a/DT great/JJ pairing/NN for/IN it/PRP meat-wise/JJ )/NN ,/, the/DT spicy/NN hoisin/NN was/VBD a/DT perfect/NN pairing/VBG to/TO the/DT beef/NN brisket/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT Thai/NNP sauce/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ on/IN the/DT southern/JJ egg/NN roll/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD made/VBN with/IN sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS inside/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD skeptical/JJ about/IN a/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN egg/NN roll/NN ,/, mainly/RB because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB crazy/JJ about/IN sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD only/RB $/$ 2.50/CD ,/, so/RB I/PRP could/MD n't/RB resist/VB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD worth/JJ it/PRP ./.
And/CC it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB big/JJ -/JJ 7/NNS or/CC 8/CD bites/NNS at/IN least/JJS ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 'll/MD ever/RB come/VB back/RB here/RB without/IN getting/NN one/CD ./.
I/PRP was/VBD really/RB hoping/JJ for/IN a/DT good/JJ barbecue/NN joint/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ new/JJ 'hood/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP hit/VBP the/DT jackpot/NN tonight/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ !/.
OK/IN I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT pressure/NN to/TO revise/VB my/PRP$ review/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT place/NN for/IN BBQ/NNP ./.

The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ nice/RB the/DT sides/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB creative/JJ and/CC pleasing/NN to/TO the/DT pallet/NN ./.
But/CC being/VBG around/IN BBQ/NNP my/NNP entire/JJ life/NN and/CC all/DT types/NNS including/VBG Memphis/NNP and/CC Dallas/NNP ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB that/IN every/DT time/NN someone/NN tries/NNS to/TO fancy/VB up/RP BBQ/NNP I/PRP am/VBP disappointed/JJ ./.

With/IN all/DT those/DT creative/JJ juices/NNS flowing/VBG Now/RB I/PRP bet/IN they/PRP could/MD do/VB that/IN well/RB !/.

We/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN with/IN the/DT kids/NNS on/IN a/DT Wednesday/NNP night/NN ./.

Six/NNP sauces/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ,/, most/JJS of/IN which/WDT I/PRP liked/VBD ./.
Even/RB my/RBR 7/JJ year/NN old/JJ gobbled/VBN up/RP the/DT slider/NN ,/, slaw/NN and/CC all/DT ./.

Disappointing/VBG !/.
Very/NNP inconstant/NN It/PRP was/VBD great/JJ last/JJ time/NN but/CC very/RB lacking/JJ tonight/NN !/.
The/DT grits/NNS were/VBD plain/NN ,/, the/DT pulled/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD soaked/VBN in/IN some/DT nasty/JJ juice/NN !/.
The/DT guy/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN was/VBD rude/NN ./.
Just/NNP not/RB impressed/VBN
I/PRP spent/VBD more/RBR here/RB than/IN I/PRP normally/RB would/MD for/IN lunch/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT spicy/NN green/JJ beans/NNS and/CC jalapeno/NN chese/NN grits/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN ./.
The/DT pulled/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD good/JJ quality/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT bit/NN dry/NN ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD an/DT additional/JJ spicy/NN BBQ/NN sauce/NN beyond/NN Spicy/NN Hoisin/NNP --/: it/PRP 's/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP prefer/VBP hoisin/NN for/IN Moo/NNP Shu/NNP ,/, not/RB 'cue/JJ .../:

I/PRP highly/VBP recommend/JJ this/DT restaurant/NN to/TO anyone/NN that/IN has/VBZ n't/RB tried/VBN ./.

They/PRP also/RB appeared/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT nice/JJ bar/NN selection/NN ,/, although/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT work/NN lunch/NN so/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB delve/VB too/RB much/JJ into/IN those/DT options/NNS !/.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB Raving/VBG Fans/NNS and/CC ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO come/VB back/RB !/.

Terrific/JJ service/NN ./.
The/DT pulled/VBD chicken/VBN BBQ/NNP sandwich/NN was/VBD basic/JJ and/CC why/RB should/MD n't/RB it/VB be/VB ;/: however/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT choice/NN of/IN bun/NN ./.
The/DT bun/NN is/VBZ like/IN a/DT Costco/NNP super/NN saver/NN kids/NNS '/POS birthday/NN party/NN bun/NN ./.
Plain/NNP ./.
White/NNP ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.
Too/NNP salty/NN ./.
Like/IN big/JJ ,/, chunky/JJ ,/, caked/VBD on/IN salt/NN ./.
I/PRP felt/VBD myself/JJ dehydrating/VBG into/IN George/NNP Hamilton/NNP ./.
The/DT sauces/NNS are/VBP a/DT decent/JJ variety/NN ./.
Have/NNP it/PRP eastern/JJ or/CC western/JJ ,/, hot/NN or/CC nothing/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB see/VB this/DT making/NN it/PRP in/IN the/DT long/JJ run/NN as/IN the/DT Cotswold/NNP crowd/NN may/MD be/VB just/RB slightly/RB too/RB sophisticated/JJ for/IN this/DT pleasant/NN but/CC less/JJR than/IN wow-ing/JJ food/NN ./.
The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP ,/, not/RB sure/JJ where/WRB to/TO begin/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD so/RB wishing/JJ to/TO like/IN it/PRP more/JJR than/IN I/PRP did/VBD ,/, but/CC overall/JJ just/RB thought/IN it/PRP was/VBD okay/NN ./.
My/NNP dinner/NN group/NN met/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT weekend/NN and/CC were/VBD seated/VBN on/IN the/DT outdoor/NN ,/, covered/VBD patio/NN on/IN cooler/NN nights/NNS ./.
Although/IN it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ to/TO sit/VB outside/JJ service/NN was/VBD very/RB slow/JJ ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ waitress/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB no/DT where/NN to/TO be/VB found/VBN several/JJ times/NNS throughout/VBP the/DT evening/NN ./.
Having/VBG not/RB been/VBN I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB some/DT appetizers/NNS that/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP for/IN the/DT table/JJ ./.
The/DT chorizo/NN stuffed/VBD jalapeños/NNS were/VBD by/IN far/RB the/DT best/JJS thing/NN I/PRP ate/VBP the/DT whole/JJ night/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD cooked/VBN too/RB perfection/NN with/IN a/DT great/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB so/RB hot/JJ ,/, kick/NN ./.
The/DT cornbread/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN was/VBD dry/JJ and/CC I/PRP definitely/RB had/VBD better/VBN ./.
And/CC ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT kale/NN chip/NN fan/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP needed/VBD more/RBR salt/JJ or/CC seasoning/VBG ,/, definitely/RB just/RB blah/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD ahead/RB and/CC ordered/VBD the/DT combo/NN platter/NN with/IN pulled/JJ chicken/NN and/CC brisket/NN ,/, with/IN Brussels/NNS Sprouts/NNS and/CC Sweet/NNP Potato/NNP Fries/NNPS ./.
The/DT pulled/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD just/RB okay/JJ ,/, not/RB as/RB moist/JJ as/IN I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN or/CC liked/VBN and/CC the/DT brisket/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, definitely/RB melt/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN moist/NN ,/, but/CC just/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN fat/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT sides/NN ,/, I/PRP definitely/RB recommend/VBP the/DT Sweet/NNP Potato/NNP Fries/NNPS ,/, so/RB good/JJ !/.
The/DT Improper/NNP Pig/NNP offers/VBZ a/DT variety/NN of/IN sauces/NNS tableside/NN ,/, so/IN you/PRP can/MD pick/VB and/CC choose/VB ./.
Unfortunately/RB I/PRP found/VBD most/JJS of/IN them/PRP a/DT little/JJ too/NN sweet/NN and/CC missed/VBD a/DT true/JJ barbeque/NN sauce/NN ./.
Overall/IN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ I/PRP finally/RB made/VBD it/PRP to/TO this/DT quaint/NN addition/NN to/TO the/DT Cotswold/NNP Shopping/NNP Center/NNP ,/, but/CC with/IN too/RB many/JJ other/JJ barbeque/NN joints/NNS ,/, that/IN I/PRP find/VBP better/RB ,/, not/RB sure/JJ I/PRP would/MD rush/VB back/RB anytime/JJ soon/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD call/VB this/DT ``/`` eccentric/JJ BBQ/NN ./. ''/''
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.
Environment/NNP is/VBZ nice/JJ ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ a/DT small/JJ bar/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
Service/NNP and/CC prices/NNS were/VBD fine/RB ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP BBQ/NNP pork/NN sandwich/NN ,/, cheese/NN grits/NNS and/CC coleslaw/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN worse/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN better/JJ too/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN ,/, and/CC looking/NN for/IN a/DT place/NN to/TO grab/VB a/DT bite/NN with/IN a/DT friend/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD consider/VB it/PRP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD been/VBN here/RB one/CD time/NN last/JJ year/NN and/CC enjoyed/VBD it/PRP ./.
So/IN recently/RB I/PRP picked/VBD it/PRP for/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN date/NN night/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN right/NN when/WRB we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN and/CC ordered/VBD drinks/VBZ (/JJ Stella/NNP for/IN me/PRP ,/, margarita/NN for/IN him/PRP )/RB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD both/DT pleased/VBN with/IN our/PRP$ drinks/NNS (/IN he/PRP described/VBD his/PRP$ as/IN tart/NN but/CC good/JJ )/NN ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT pork/NN roll/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD really/RB good/JJ but/CC a/DT not/RB so/RB good/JJ portion/NN size/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ listed/VBN as/IN an/DT appetizer/NN but/CC is/VBZ more/RBR like/IN a/DT side/NN item/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ one/CD egg/NN roll/NN cut/VBD in/IN half/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC for/IN the/DT price/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD at/IN least/JJS get/CD two/CD !/.
My/NNP fella/NNP had/VBD the/DT improper/NN charcuterie/NN ,/, which/WDT he/PRP loved/VBD ./.
In/IN fact/NN he/PRP told/VBD me/PRP that/IN he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB think/VB he/PRP would/MD order/VB anything/NN else/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT salmon/JJ chow/NN bao/NN taco/NN with/IN green/JJ beans/NNS ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD both/DT ./.
The/DT slaw/NN on/IN the/DT taco/NN lacked/VBD flavor/NN so/IN I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP just/RB taking/VBG most/JJS of/IN it/PRP off/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD tasty/JJ and/CC I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT sauce/NN on/IN the/DT salmon/NN ./.
The/DT green/JJ beans/NNS are/VBP awesome/JJ !/.
I/PRP could/MD eat/VB them/PRP all/DT day/NN every/DT day/NN !/.
Overall/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT date/NN night/NN success/NN ./.
We/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB !/.
Arrived/VBN just/RB before/IN 7pm/CD on/IN a/DT friday/NN night/NN ,/, little/JJ surprised/VBD to/TO see/VB a/DT nearly/RB empty/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
But/CC had/VBD a/DT great/JJ meal/NN and/CC dining/VBG experience/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT pork/NN sandwich/NN ,/, with/IN coleslaw/NN and/CC baked/VBD beans/NNS ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ordered/VBD pulled/VBN chicken/NN with/IN coleslaw/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
Only/RB criticism/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT servings/NNS were/VBD a/DT little/JJ smaller/NN than/IN I/PRP had/VBD expected/VBN ./.
Would/NNP recommend/NN to/TO friends/NNS and/CC we/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
So/IN far/RB I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB three/CD times/NNS and/CC every/DT time/NN has/VBZ been/VBN absolutely/RB fantastic/JJ ./.
Swift/NN service/NN with/IN a/DT smile/NN and/CC excellent/JJ menu/NN choices/NNS
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ local/JJ spot/NN ,/, like/IN Southern/NNP barbecue/NN with/IN a/DT unique/JJ twist/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN I/PRP went/VBD was/VBD even/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT first/JJ ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP still/RB pretty/RB new/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP the/DT place/NN is/VBZ flowing/VBG now/RB ./.
Portions/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ,/, sauces/NNS are/VBP homemade/NN and/CC you/PRP add/VB your/PRP$ own/NN at/IN the/DT table/JJ ./.
There/EX are/VBP vegetarian/JJ options/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN carnivorous/JJ ones/NNS ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT crowd/NN pleaser/NN ./.
I/PRP typically/RB leave/VBP both/DT full/NNS and/CC with/IN a/DT box/NN for/IN later/JJ ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN great/JJ service/NN both/DT times/NNS ./.
One/CD of/IN my/PRP$ dining/NN partners/NNS has/VBZ food/VBN allergies/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD more/JJR than/IN accommodating/NN for/IN him/PRP as/RB well/RB ./.
Check/NNP it/PRP out/IN !/.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP ate/VBP here/RB May/VBN 3rd/CD ./.
We/PRP had/VBD brisket/JJ YUM/NNP and/CC pork/NNP and/CC egg/NNP roll/NN appetizers/NNS one/CD with/IN pork/NN and/CC one/CD with/IN sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS (/IN this/DT was/VBD the/DT only/JJ item/NN I/PRP would/MD n't/RB get/VB again/RB )/RB ./.
Sides/NNS were/VBD mac/JJ and/CC cheese/NN ,/, brussel/NN sprouts/NNS YUM/NNP and/CC collards/VBZ The/DT flavors/NNS were/VBD great/JJ -/JJ the/DT meat/NN was/VBD very/RB moist/JJ ,/, and/CC had/VBD a/DT very/RB light/JJ smoky/NN flavor/NN ./.
I/PRP expected/VBP a/DT smokier/NN meat/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD so/RB delicate/JJ and/CC moist/NN and/CC tasted/VBN fresh/NN that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP definitely/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD also/RB neat/JJ that/IN there/EX are/VBP Asian/JJ influences/NNS in/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT menu/NN items/NNS as/IN sauces/NNS ,/, so/RB this/DT is/VBZ an/DT typical/JJ bbq/NN place/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT little/RB pricier/JJR than/IN typical/JJ BBQ/NNP restaurants/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT quality/NN of/IN food/NN and/CC flavors/NNS was/VBD worth/IN the/DT price-/JJ all/DT the/DT sides/NNS were/VBD a/DT little/JJ better/NN than/IN you/PRP would/MD normally/RB find.and/VB I/PRP cant/JJ wait/NN to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
Great/NNP barbeque/NN ,/, service/NN ,/, drinks/VBZ ,/, and/CC ambience/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN ,/, Michelle/NNP ,/, was/VBD welcoming/JJ and/CC had/VBD excellent/JJ suggestions/NNS for/IN drinks/NNS and/CC entrée/VB options/NNS ./.

That/DT being/VBG said/VBN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB love/VB their/PRP$ BBQ/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN does/VBZ have/VB on/IN it/PRP the/DT usual/JJ BBQ/NNP items/NNP (/NNP pulled/VBD pork/NN ,/, brisket/NN ,/, ribs/NNS ,/, etc/NN ./.
)/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT risk/NN of/IN upsetting/VBG the/DT fragile/JJ Cotswold/NNP pallate/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB order/VB those/DT items/NNS ./.

And/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ they/PRP did/VBD !/.
Absolutely/RB ALL/RB of/IN their/PRP$ appetizers/NNS are/VBP amaaaazing/VBG ./.
You/PRP MUST/VBP try/IN the/DT BBQ/NNP Kale/NNP Chips/NNP ,/, or/CC the/DT Improper/NNP Nachos/NNP ./.
And/CC I/PRP believe/VBP I/PRP 've/VBP mentioned/VBN Twice-Baked/JJ Jalepenos/NNP previously/NNP ./.

Food/NNP is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, chill/NN atmosphere/RB ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN options/NNS even/RB for/IN those/DT who/NNS are/VBP vegan/vegetarian/JJ ./.
This/DT was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ time/NN trying/VBG Improper/NN Pig/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD very/RB impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT look/NN and/CC feel/NN inside/NN the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT patio/NN area/NN ./.
In/IN regards/NNS to/TO the/DT food/NN .../: ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT half/JJ rack/NN of/IN ribs/NNS with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN ./.
And/CC then/RB I/PRP ordered/VBP one/CD additional/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT collard/NN greens/NNS ./.
A/DT half/NN of/IN rack/NN with/IN one/CD side/NN was/VBD $/$ 14/CD ./.
I/PRP would/MD think/VB that/IN for/IN a/DT rib/NN plate/NN .../: it/PRP would/MD automatically/RB come/VB with/IN two/CD sides/NNS ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD ordered/VBN a/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN plate/NN with/IN the/DT jalapeño/NN grits/NNS and/CC Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN ./.
After/IN trying/VBG my/PRP$ ribs/NNS and/CC my/VB husband/NN 's/POS pulled/JJ pork/NN ,/, I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP trading/NN with/IN him/PRP ./.
The/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN was/VBD better/JJR than/IN the/DT ribs/NNS ./.
The/DT ribs/NNS wasnt/VBP as/RB tender/JJ as/IN Midwood/NNP ./.
But/CC the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP paired/VBD the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN with/IN the/DT Queen/VBN Bee/NNP sauce/NN since/IN its/PRP$ a/DT sweet/JJ BBQ/NNP sauce/NN ./.
But/CC what/WP I/PRP really/VBP loved/VBN was/VBD the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB cheesy/JJ and/CC I/PRP could/MD tell/VB that/IN they/PRP used/VBD cheddar/NN cheese/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT collard/NN greens/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, although/JJ once/RB you/PRP get/VBP to/TO the/DT bottom/NN .../: .it/JJ drowned/VBD in/IN vinegar/NN ./.
The/DT jalapeño/NN cheese/NN grits/NNS was/VBD good/JJ too/NN .../:
Even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB as/RB thick/JJ as/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP use/VBG to/TO ./.
Nevertheless/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD still/RB good/JJ ./.
Prior/RB to/TO ordering/VBG our/PRP$ entrées/NNS ,/, we/PRP had/VBD the/DT southern/JJ egg/NN rolls/NNS ./.
There/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD thing/NN missing/NN .../: .these/NN rolls/NNS does/VBZ not/RB include/VB meat/NN ./.
If/IN they/PRP were/VBD to/TO put/VB pull/JJ pork/NN in/IN their/PRP$ rolls/NNS ,/, then/RB it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN better/JJR ./.
But/CC I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB complain/VB because/IN it/PRP was/VBD still/RB good/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT free/JJ appetizer/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP download/VBP their/PRP$ stealz/JJ app/NN ,/, they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP the/DT appetizer/NN for/IN free/JJ ./.
So/IN that/DT was/VBD nice/JJ ./.
Overall/IN ,/, I/PRP liked/VBD this/DT place/NN for/IN their/PRP$ pulled/JJ pork/NN and/CC Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB again/RB ./.
