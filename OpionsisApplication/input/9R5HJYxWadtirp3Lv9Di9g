With/IN a/DT name/NN like/IN Carhops/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ no/DT surprise/NN that/IN the/DT sandwiches/NNS are/VBP named/VBN after/IN cars/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB tried/VBN them/PRP all/DT (/NN yet/RB )/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN the/DT DeVille/NNP (/NNP cheesesteak/NN )/NN ,/, GTO/NNP (/NNP cheesesteak/NN with/IN bacon/NN )/NNS ,/, Carhops/NNP Special/NNP Loaded/NNP (/NNP cold/NN Italian/JJ )/NN and/CC the/DT Super/NNP Sport/NNP (/NNP hot/NN Italian/JJ )/NN ./.
The/DT cheesesteak/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ favorite/NN is/VBZ definitely/RB the/DT Italian/JJ hoagies/NNS because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ hot/NN peppers/NNS and/CC relish/VB ./.
Top/NNP a/DT deliciously/RB chewy/JJ baguette/NN with/IN some/DT choice/NN meats/NNS and/CC cheese/NN and/CC those/DT hot/NN peppers/NNS and/CC relish/JJ and/CC you/PRP have/VBP yourself/VBN an/DT unbeatable/JJ sandwich/NN !/.
They/PRP are/VBP available/JJ in/IN foot/NN or/CC two-foot/JJ long/JJ sizes/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN the/DT pizza/NN slices/NNS and/CC they/PRP look/VBP good/JJ but/CC I/PRP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB tried/VBN them/PRP ./.
Their/NN prices/NNS do/VBP seem/RB a/DT bit/JJ steep/NN and/CC their/PRP$ customer/NN service/NN can/MD be/VB hit/VBN or/CC miss/NNS ./.
I/PRP think/VBP maybe/JJ they/PRP are/VBP still/RB settling/VBG in/IN to/TO the/DT new/JJ location/NN which/WDT is/VBZ fine/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB how/WRB often/RB I/PRP will/MD return/VB once/RB I/PRP use/VBP up/RP my/PRP$ half/NN off/IN certificates/NNS ./.
I/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN here/RB earlier/VBN today/NN by/IN myself/NN for/IN a/DT to/TO go/VB lunch/NN ./.
Whenever/NNP I/PRP stepped/VBD inside/JJ it/PRP was/VBD just/RB after/IN 1/CD PM/NNP on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP and/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD empty/NN ./.
The/DT person/NN who/WP would/MD wait/VB and/CC cook/VB for/IN me/PRP was/VBD also/RB sitting/VBG at/IN a/DT booth/NN and/CC said/VBD he/PRP would/MD be/VB with/IN me/PRP in/IN a/DT minute/NN ./.
Neither/NN of/IN those/DT are/VBP normally/RB a/DT good/JJ sign/NN but/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB it/PRP anyways/RB ./.
The/DT inside/NN of/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ actually/RB bigger/JJR than/IN it/PRP looks/VBZ from/IN the/DT outside/NN with/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN booths/NNS on/IN one/CD side/NN and/CC a/DT U/NNP shaped/VBD bar/NN with/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN high/JJ tops/NNS on/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.
My/NNP original/JJ intent/NN in/IN coming/NN here/NN was/VBD to/TO get/VB a/DT smaller/JJR cheese/NN steak/NN and/CC to/TO try/VB a/DT slice/NN of/IN the/DT pizza/NN ./.
The/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP signs/VBN outside/IN saying/VBG ``/`` pizza/NN by/IN the/DT slice/NN ''/'' and/CC ``/`` #/NNP 1/CD Cheese/NNP steak/NN ''/'' ./.
That/DT did/VBD n't/RB exactly/RB work/VB out/RP for/IN me/PRP though/RB as/IN they/PRP have/VBP two/VBN sizes/NNS of/IN cheese/NN steaks/NNS ,/, the/DT coupe/NN which/WDT is/VBZ 1ft/CD and/CC the/DT sedan/JJ which/NN is/VBZ 2ft/CD ./.
The/DT prices/NNS match/VBP those/DT sizes/NNS too/RB and/CC so/RB with/IN that/DT and/CC not/RB being/VBG able/JJ to/TO find/VB a/DT slice/NN of/IN pizza/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT first/JJ cheese/NN steak/NN on/IN it/PRP in/IN the/DT coupe/NN size/NN ./.
The/DT cashier/NN asked/VBD me/PRP if/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB lettuce/NN ,/, tomato/NN or/CC onion/NN ./.
I/PRP replied/VBD with/IN lettuce/NN and/CC then/RB after/IN thinking/VBG about/IN it/PRP for/IN a/DT minute/JJ I/PRP decided/VBD on/IN the/DT onion/NN too/RB ./.
Silly/RB me/PRP for/IN thinking/NN that/IN they/PRP would/MD cook/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT steak/JJ as/IN it/PRP ended/VBD up/RP being/VBG raw/NN ./.
After/IN that/DT exchange/NN I/PRP found/VBD myself/NN a/DT seat/NN in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT empty/NN booths/NNS and/CC started/VBD to/TO write/VB the/DT first/JJ paragraph/NN of/IN this/DT review/NN ./.
About/IN half/DT way/NN through/IN that/DT paragraph/NN ,/, it/PRP could/MD n't/RB have/VB been/VBN more/JJR than/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD ready/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD leaving/VBG the/DT place/NN ./.
The/DT one/CD thing/NN I/PRP noticed/VBD right/JJ away/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT sandwich/NN was/VBD wrapped/VBN nicely/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD long/JJ but/CC boy/JJ was/VBD it/PRP pretty/RB skinny/NN ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP spending/NN about/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS finishing/VBG my/PRP$ shopping/NN in/IN the/DT strip/NN before/IN heading/VBG back/RB to/TO my/PRP$ car/NN to/TO eat/VB the/DT sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT bread/JJ looked/JJ like/IN a/DT baguette/NN and/CC had/VBD a/DT decent/JJ crunch/NN but/CC as/IN mentioned/JJ earlier/NN was/VBD pretty/RB skinny/JJ ./.
Since/IN there/EX was/VBD n't/RB much/JJ width/NN to/TO the/DT bread/NN ,/, the/DT sandwich/NN was/VBD pretty/RB filled/VBN up/RP mostly/RB by/IN the/DT steak/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN melted/VBN cheese/NN and/CC also/RB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN lettuce/NN and/CC raw/NN onion/NN ./.
The/DT sandwich/NN ended/VBD up/RP tasting/VBG just/RB ok/NN ./.
The/DT meat/NN was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC the/DT sandwich/JJ could/MD have/VB used/VBN some/DT more/JJR cheese/NN and/CC I/PRP really/RB wish/VBP that/IN they/PRP would/MD have/VB cooked/VBN the/DT onions/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN I/PRP had/VBD finished/VBN the/DT sandwich/JJ but/CC still/RB found/VBD myself/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ hungry/NN ./.
The/DT bottom/NN line/NN for/IN me/PRP is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP probably/RB would/MD not/RB stop/VB by/IN here/RB again/RB in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
My/NNP cashier/NN was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN I/PRP could/MD get/VB a/DT lot/NN better/RBR bang/NN for/IN my/PRP$ buck/NN elsewhere/RB ./.
The/DT thing/NN I/PRP dislike/VBP the/DT most/JJS about/IN the/DT Pittsburgh/NNP bar/food/NN scene/NN is/VBZ that/IN after/IN ,/, probably/RB 2/CD am/NN at/IN the/DT absolute/JJ latest/NN ,/, the/DT choices/NNS for/IN that/DT after-drinking/JJ meal/snack/NN are/VBP very/RB slim/JJ ./.
Primantis/NNP has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN the/DT ``/`` go/NN to/TO ''/'' place/NN among/IN people/NNS I/PRP frequently/RB go/VBD out/IN with-not/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ tasty/JJ (/NNS do/VBP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/VB ,/, a/DT Primanti/NNP 's/POS sandwich/NN has/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ time/NN and/CC place/NN but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB an/DT ultimate/JJ fan/JJ )/NN but/CC because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ centrally/RB located/VBN and/CC we/PRP know/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ open/JJ 24/7/CD ./.
My/NNP friends/NNS and/CC I/PRP had/VBD always/RB seen/VBN Carhops/NNP in/IN the/DT strip/NN but/CC had/VBD not/RB tried/VBN it/PRP until/IN this/DT past/NN Saturday-what/NN a/DT mistake/NN to/TO not/RB try/VB carhops/NNS sooner/JJR !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ less/JJR greasy/JJ (/NNS although/IN not/RB extremely/RB healthy/JJ )/NN than/IN Primanti/NNP 's/POS ,/, more/RBR variety/JJ than/IN Primanti/NNP 's/POS (/NN not/RB just/RB sandwiches/VBZ )/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP can/MD eat/VB in/IN or/CC go/VB up/RB to/TO the/DT window/NN ./.
Plus/NNP they/PRP have/VBP pizza/VBN by/IN the/DT slice/NN late/NN into/IN the/DT night/NN ./.
I/PRP split/VBD a/DT foot/NN long/RB Italian/JJ sandwich/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD the/DT perfect/NN size/NN to/TO split/VB and/CC not/RB be/VB overly/RB stuffed/VBN ./.
The/DT bread/JJ seemed/NN like/IN a/DT good/JJ quality/NN for/IN a/DT late/JJ night/NN sandwich/NN as/IN did/JJ all/NN of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS ./.
My/NNP other/JJ friend/NN had/VBD a/DT couple/NN slices/NNS of/IN pizza/NN and/CC said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD really/RB tasty/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD all/DT in/IN agreement/NN ,/, the/DT next/JJ time/NN late/JJ night/NN hunger/NN strikes/NNS after/IN last/JJ call/NN ,/, Carhops/NNP will/MD be/VB the/DT final/JJ stop/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN !/.
Now/RB I/PRP am/VBP a/DT traveled/VBN man/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN cheesesteaks/NNS in/IN a/DT lot/NN if/IN towns/NNS ./.
Sorry/NNP guys/VBZ but/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP all/DT know/NN that/IN this/DT particular/JJ sub/NN is/VBZ the/DT ONE/NNP SINGLE/NNP THING/NNP Philly/NNP can/MD ever/VB claim/NN to/TO beat/VB us/PRP at/IN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD Pat/NNP 's/POS and/CC Geno/NNP 's/POS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP on/IN another/DT level/NN hands/NNS down/IN ./.
That/DT being/VBG said/VBN ,/, Carhops/NNP makes/VBZ a/DT damn/JJ good/JJ cheesesteak/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT Cadillac/NNP themed/VBD hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN down/IN in/IN the/DT strip/NN district/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP its/PRP$ kinda/NN cool/NN ;/: I/PRP love/VBP divey/JJ holes/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ bar/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ standard/JJ domestic/JJ drafts/NNS and/CC bottles/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT sub/NN joint/NN that/WDT sells/VBZ beer/JJR rather/RB than/IN the/DT other/JJ way/NN around/IN ./.
The/DT steaks/NNS themselves/PRP are/VBP pretty/RB damn/JJ good/JJ ./.
I/PRP often/RB get/VBP the/DT GTO/NNP (/NNP all/PDT the/DT subs/NNS are/VBP named/VBN after/IN cars/NNS )/RB because/IN the/DT only/JJ thing/NN better/JJR than/IN a/DT cheesesteak/NN is/VBZ a/DT cheesesteak/NN with/IN bacon/NN ./.
A/DT big/JJ part/NN of/IN what/WP makes/VBZ their/PRP$ steaks/NNS so/RB good/RB is/VBZ n't/RB just/RB the/DT premium/NN beef/IN they/PRP use/VBP ,/, but/CC the/DT crusty/NN chewy/NN French/NNP bread/VBD the/DT subs/NNS are/VBP served/VBN on/IN ./.
The/DT subs/NNS are/VBP served/VBN in/IN 12/CD ''/'' and/CC 24/NNP ''/'' portions/NNS with/IN the/DT 24/NN ''/'' running/NN about/IN 20/CD bucks/NNS ./.
