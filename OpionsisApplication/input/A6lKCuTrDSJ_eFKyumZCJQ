I/PRP ordered/VBP cause/JJ they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB listed/VBN as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT dish/JJ ./.
The/DT shrimp/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ too/NN mushy/NN for/IN my/PRP$ taste/NN and/CC the/DT fried/JJ rice/NN has/VBZ NO/VBN flavor/NN at/IN all/DT .../NNS like/IN plain/NN white/JJ rice/NN ./.

My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP walked/VBN past/JJ this/DT restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT Silverton/NNP Casino/NNP many/VBD a/DT time/NN !/.

You/PRP have/VBP set/VBN hours/NNS so/RB why/VBP not/RB keep/VB them/PRP I/PRP could/MD understand/VB if/IN nobody/NN was/VBD cooking/VBG still/RB but/CC your/RB chefs/NNS were/VBD still/RB cooking/VBG ./.

We/PRP eat/VBP Chinese/JJ quite/JJ often/NN and/CC really/RB love/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB was/VBD outstanding/JJ !/.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP and/CC WuHu/NNP fried/VBD rice/NN ,/, both/DT were/VBD perfect/NN ./.
We/PRP often/RB eat/VBP in/IN china/NN town/NN in/IN Vegas/NNP and/CC the/DT food/NN there/NN for/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT was/VBD better/VBN and/CC at/IN a/DT casino/NN !/.

My/NNP point/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP followed/VBD the/DT Chinese/JJ tradition/NN of/IN cooking/VBG everything/NN fresh/NN -/JJ no/DT par/NN boiled/VBD veggies/NNS or/CC meat/NN to/TO speed/VB up/RP the/DT prep/NN time/NN !/.
The/DT noodles/NNS were/VBD done/VBN just/RB right/RB -/JJ a/DT little/JJ crispy/NN yet/RB softened/VBN by/IN the/DT HK/NNP sauce/NN ./.
