This/DT was/VBD a/DT place/NN I/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO revisit/VB if/IN I/PRP lived/VBD in/IN Madison/NNP ./.

For/IN the/DT food/NN Muramoto/NNP is/VBZ Asian/JJ fusion/NN in/IN tapas/NNS style/NN ./.

In/IN a/DT handful/NN of/IN visits/NNS since/IN it/PRP opened/VBD a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/IN ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN Muramoto/NNP to/TO have/VB generally/RB outstanding/JJ food/NN and/CC often/RB less-than-ideal/JJ service/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, ahh/JJ ,/, the/DT food/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT most/RBS creative/JJ food/NN in/IN Madison/NNP ./.

That/DT said/VBD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT mistake/NN to/TO think/NN of/IN Muramoto/NNP as/IN a/DT sushi/NN place/NN ,/, though/IN (/JJ there/NN is/VBZ a/DT Muramoto/NNP sushi/NN restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT hilldale/JJ area/NN )/NNS --/: my/JJ favorite/JJ dishes/NNS here/RB have/VBP included/VBN the/DT soy/JJ cod/NN ,/, a/DT lamb/NN curry/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT few/JJ amazing/VBG salads/NNS ./.
In/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN ,/, the/DT oft-changing/JJ menu/NN contains/VBZ little/JJ that/IN is/VBZ n't/RB great/JJ --/: an/DT omnivore/NN with/IN an/DT open-minded/JJ palate/NN could/MD safely/RB close/VB their/PRP$ eyes/NNS and/CC just/RB start/JJ pointing/VBG ./.

I/PRP had/VBD my/VBN first/JJ visit/NN since/IN they/PRP turned/VBP into/IN a/DT tapas/NN bar/NN style/NN spot/NN ./.
Got/NN to/TO say/VB ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP still/RB serving/VBG the/DT best/JJS ``/`` imitation/NN ''/'' of/IN the/DT real/JJ stuff/NN -/NN does/VBZ n't/RB really/VB fly/RB by/IN me/PRP ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP like/VBP that/IN kind/NN of/IN thing/NN ,/, I/PRP suppose/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ ok/NN ./.
Depending/VBG on/IN the/DT bartenders/NNS ,/, some/DT drinks/NNS are/VBP so/RB underwhelming/VBG that/IN it/PRP made/VBD me/PRP feel/VBP unnecessarily/RB girly/RB ./.
Oh/NNP well/RB ./.
On/IN the/DT positive/JJ note/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ fun/VBN to/TO try/VB out/RP many/JJ small/JJ plates/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP infatuated/VBN with/IN my/PRP$ new/JJ love/NN ,/, Muramoto/NNP ./.
At/IN first/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD highly/RB doubtful/JJ the/DT state/NN of/IN Wisconsin/NNP could/MD feature/VB decent/JJ sushi/NN but/CC boy/NN oh/NN boy/NN was/VBD I/PRP wrong/VBP ./.
Mad/NNP props/VBZ incredibly/RB for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP feature/VBP a/DT deeeelicious/JJ Philly/NNP role/NN with/IN salmon/JJ and/CC cream/NN cheese/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD followed/VBN by/IN the/DT corn/lemongrass/NN chowder-/NN big/JJ disappointment/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'll/MD let/VB it/PRP slide/VB ./.
On/IN to/TO the/DT main/JJ courses-/NN started/NN with/IN the/DT tuna/mayo/NN roll/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD a/DT quite/JJ a/DT big/JJ portion/NN and/CC really/NN was/VBD a/DT great/JJ sushi/NN roll/NN for/IN those/DT that/IN like/IN the/DT bells/NNS and/CC whistles/NNS ./.

The/DT bleu/NN cheese/NN sauce/NN was/VBD just/RB perfect/JJ and/CC made/VBD the/DT steak/NN that/IN much/JJ better/NN ./.
Could/NNP have/VBP used/VBN just/RB a/DT tad/JJ more/RBR crust/JJ on/IN the/DT meat/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP had/VBD the/DT miso/NN black/NN cod/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ how/WRB fish/JJ should/NN taste/NN ./.
It/PRP melted/VBD in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD salty/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN a/DT great/JJ way/NN ./.

Muramoto/NNP is/VBZ really/RB the/DT best/JJS place/NN in/IN Madison/NNP for/IN Sushi/NNP ./.

The/DT service/NN is/VBZ always/RB great/JJ ,/, not/RB just/RB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP prompt/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP know/VBP the/DT menu/NN and/CC the/DT drink/NN menu/NN and/CC can/MD make/VB intelligent/JJ recommendations/NNS that/IN I/PRP am/VBP usually/RB pleased/VBN with/IN ./.
Muramoto/NNP 's/POS creative/JJ rolls/NNS are/VBP SO/NNP delicious/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP all/DT different/JJ tasting/NN and/CC the/DT only/JJ comparison/NN to/TO their/PRP$ taste/NN comes/NNS from/IN good/JJ sushi/NN places/NNS in/IN Chicago/NNP ./.
I/PRP get/VBP take/JJ out/NN here/RB at/IN least/JJS once/RB a/DT week/NN and/CC dine/NN here/RB about/IN once/CD or/CC twice/VB a/DT month/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP fantastic/JJ sushi/NN at/IN really/RB a/DT quite/JJ reasonable/JJ price/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ your/VBG place/NN !/.
Just/NN to/TO be/VB clear/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ 'tapas-style/JJ '/NN Muramoto/NNP ./.

Great/NNP date/NNP place/NN and/CC it/PRP just/RB feels/VBZ sexy/NN ./.
The/DT Food/NN :/: I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO like/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP really/RB did/VBD ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN small/JJ plates/NNS and/CC not/RB ONE/NNP of/IN them/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, even/RB they/PRP even/RB managed/VBP to/TO blow/JJ bacon-wrapped/JJ figs/NNS stuffed/VBD with/IN blue/JJ cheese/NN ./.
Now/RB thats/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ to/TO screw/NN up/IN ./.
The/DT plates/NNS ranged/VBD from/IN merely/NNP ok/NN to/TO bad/JJ (/NN octopus/VBZ 'balls/NNS '/POS were/VBD like/IN fried/VBN croquettes/NNS with/IN elastic/JJ bands/NNS in/IN the/DT middle/JJ )/NN ./.

The/DT place/NN is/VBZ cheap/NN for/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, especially/RB the/DT drinks/NNS ./.
So/RB all/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, go/VBP for/IN drinks/NNS ,/, ambiance/NN and/CC to/TO impress/NN a/DT date/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP even/RB order/VBD a/DT small/JJ plate/NN or/CC two/CD but/CC do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB it/PRP to/TO taste/VB as/RB gourmet/JJ as/IN it/PRP sounds/VBZ on/IN the/DT menu/NN .../:

Did/NNP n't/RB really/RB taste/VB the/DT citrusy/NN fruit/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
It/PRP kind/VBD of/IN reminded/JJ me/NN of/IN a/DT smoother/NN version/NN of/IN cheesecake/NN without/IN the/DT graham/NN cracker/NN crust/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT drizzle/NN of/IN some/DT berry/JJ compote/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN ginger/JJ but/CC for/IN some/DT reason/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB the/DT ice/NN cream/NN ./.
Honey/NNP Black/NNP Sesame/NNP Creme/NNP Brulee/NNP -/JJ this/DT was/VBD not/RB my/JJ favorite/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ ./.
The/DT creme/NN was/VBD n't/RB super/JJ creamy/NN but/CC had/VBD a/DT little/JJ texture/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.
The/DT color/NN of/IN the/DT creme/NN was/VBD a/DT dark/JJ charcoal/NN grey/NN and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN smokey/NN sesame/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT clever/NN idea/NN but/CC not/RB something/NN I/PRP would/MD try/VB again/RB ./.

A/DT bit/JJ expensive/NN ,/, but/CC worth/IN it/PRP ./.
Muramoto/NNP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB good/JJ restaurant/NN if/IN you/PRP enjoy/VBP a/DT limited/JJ selection/NN of/IN very/RB good/JJ things/NNS ./.
The/DT duck/NN roll/NN is/VBZ outstanding/JJ as/IN are/VBP the/DT oyster/NN shots/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP my/VBG favorite/JJ way/NN to/TO start/VB dinner/NN ./.
Criticism-wise/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT problem/NN with/IN seating/NN in/IN the/DT wintertime/NN ,/, as/IN there/EX is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT draft/JJ coming/NN in/IN from/IN the/DT door/NN if/IN you/PRP sit/VBP too/RB close/JJ to/TO it/PRP ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD not/RB make/VB reservations/NNS at/IN Muramoto/NNP ./.
This/DT means/NN of/IN course/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD not/RB request/VB a/DT table/JJ further/JJ away/NN from/IN the/DT door/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO in/IN advance/NN (/NN first/RB come/VBD first/RB serve/JJ )/NN ./.
