I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Quattro/NNP pizza/NN with/IN extra/JJ mozzarella/NN which/WDT came/-NONE- to/TO me/VB quickly/RB tasted/VBN very/RB good/JJ and/CC I/PRP was/VBD pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT overall/JJ meal/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD earlier/JJR right/NN around/IN 11/CD so/IN it/PRP was/VBD wide/JJ open/JJ with/IN great/JJ service/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP first/RB tried/VBD this/DT place/NN I/PRP was/VBD very/RB surprised/VBN about/IN the/DT style/NN of/IN pizza/NN because/IN I/PRP had/VBD never/RB tried/VBN it/PRP before/IN !/.
But/CC I/PRP absolute/VBP love/JJ it/PRP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB like/IN the/DT pizza/NN you/PRP can/MD get/VB from/IN Pizza/NNP Hut/NNP so/RB be/VB ready/NN but/CC you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB disappointed/VBN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT white/JJ asparagus/NN pizza/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
I/PRP came/VBD in/IN on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD Bethanie/NNP she/PRP was/VBD very/RB quick/JJ and/CC super/NN attentive/JJ !/.
She/PRP has/VBZ really/RB good/JJ customer/NN service/NN and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT most/RBS important/JJ part/NN other/JJ than/IN the/DT food/NN of/IN course/NN !/.
I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB
The/DT dough/JJ (/NN crust/NN )/RB comes/VBZ out/RP burned/charred/VBD ./.
I/PRP am/VBP OK/RB with/IN the/DT tasteless/NN tomato/NN sauce/NN some/DT people/NNS mention/NN ,/, I/PRP actually/RB like/IN sauce/NN like/IN that/DT ./.
Some/DT other/JJ pizzerias/NNS just/RB add/VBP too/RB many/JJ spices/NNS in/IN the/DT sauce/NN and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB it/PRP ./.
But/CC why/NNP ,/, or/CC why/WRB ?/.
Why/WRB do/VBP you/PRP burn/VB the/DT crust/NN like/IN that/DT ./.
Please/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB tell/VB me/PRP that/IN 's/POS how/WRB oven/JJ baked/JJ or/CC wood/JJ fired/NN pizza/NN should/MD be/VB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN them/PRP all/DT and/CC the/DT crust/NN should/MD NOT/VB be/VB so/RB burned/VBN ./.
Check/NNP out/IN my/PRP$ photos/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD so/RB bad/JJ ,/, my/JJ kids/NN did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO eat/VB the/DT pizza/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT end/NN they/PRP ate/VBP only/RB the/DT mid/JJ secrion/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT pizza/NN is/VBZ very/RB thin/JJ ./.
The/DT sauce/NN and/CC cheese/NN are/VBP light/JJ ./.
Toppings/NNS tasted/VBD good/JJ ./.
These/DT are/VBP all/DT food/NN things/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP give/VBP it/PRP 2/VBZ stars/NNS ./.
Other/JJ bad/JJ things/NNS -/JJ other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT pizza/NN were/VBD slightly/RB burned/VBN as/IN well/RB and/CC the/DT toppings/NNS were/VBD unevenly/RB spread/JJ ./.
Please/NN ,/, fix/NN your/NN ovens/NNS or/CC replace/VB them/PRP ./.
Meh/NNP .../: it/PRP was/VBD okay/NN ./.
Nothing/NN bad/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ part/NN .../: their/PRP$ style/NN of/IN pizza/NN is/VBZ just/RB not/RB my/VB cup/NN of/IN tea/NN ./.
I/PRP prefer/VBP a/DT thicker/NN crust/NN ./.
Not/RB bad/JJ ./.
Just/NNP not/RB the/DT best/JJS pizza/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN .../: I/PRP likely/JJ will/MD not/RB be/VB going/VBG out/IN of/IN my/NN way/NN for/IN a/DT follow-up/JJ visit/NN but/CC if/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN friends/NNS wanted/VBD to/TO visit/NN again/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB opposed/VBN ./.
Warm/NNP Beets/NNP (/VBD $/$ 8.50/CD )/CD :/: Roasted/VBN golden/NN and/CC red/VBD beets/NNS ,/, goat/NN cheese/NN crema/NN ,/, roasted/VBN garlic/NN ,/, dill/NN ,/, olive/JJ oil/NN ,/, and/CC Marcona/NNP almonds/NNS ./.
Wonderful/NNP antipasti/NNP dish/VB !/.
The/DT beets/NNS were/VBD lovely/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD really/RB pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT goat/NN cheese/NN crema/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT modest/JJ amount/NN and/CC did/VBD n't/RB dare/VB overpower/VB the/DT beautiful/JJ beets/NNS ./.
The/DT almonds/NNS were/VBD a/DT nice/JJ touch/NN !/.
Polpette/NNP Napoletane/NNP (/VBD $/$ 14/CD )/CD :/: Neapolitan/NNP beef/NN and/CC pork/NN meatballs/NNS ,/, covered/VBD in/IN Neapolitan/NNP tomato/NN sauce/NN ,/, fresh/JJ mozzarella/NN ,/, and/CC basil/NN ./.
The/DT meatballs/NNS were/VBD simple/NN and/CC just/RB loaded/VBD with/IN meat/NN and/CC practically/RB no/DT filler/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ served/VBN with/IN buttered/VBN toast/NN that/IN 's/VBZ been/VBN tossed/VBN into/IN the/DT oven/NN as/RB well/RB ;/: delicious/JJ ./.
Margherita/NNP DOC/NNP (/VBD $/$ 14/CD )/CD :/: Crushed/NNP tomato/NN ,/, mozzarella/NN di/NN bufala/NN ,/, parmigiano/NN ,/, and/CC basil/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ all-time/JJ favorite/JJ pizza/NN styles/NNS and/CC this/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB one/CD I/PRP 'd/MD want/VB again/RB ./.
The/DT dough/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT components/NNS created/VBD a/DT solid/JJ Napoletana/NNP pizza/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT non-DOC/JJ option/NN without/IN buffalo/NN mozzarella/NN for/IN $/$ 12/CD ./.
Pizza/NNP Carbonara/NNP (/VBD $/$ 13/CD )/CD :/: Crushed/NNP tomato/NN ,/, panchetta/NN ,/, egg/NN ,/, cracked/VBD pepper/NN ,/, parmigiano/NN ,/, mozzarella/NN ,/, basil/NN ,/, and/CC olive/JJ oil/NN ./.
All/DT of/IN their/PRP$ pizzas/NNS start/VBP the/DT same/JJ way/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT same/JJ great/JJ crust/dough/NN ./.
My/NNP disappointment/NN with/IN this/DT pizza/NN was/VBD the/DT scarcity/NN of/IN toppings/NNS and/CC the/DT cooked/JJ yolk/NN -/NN that/WDT 's/POS definitely/RB not/RB what/WP I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG ./.
Since/IN this/DT is/VBZ atypical/JJ for/IN Carbonara/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP should/MD be/VB disclosed/VBN on/IN the/DT menu/NN or/CC as/IN you/PRP order/VBP ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ beautiful/JJ and/CC the/DT vibe/NN is/VBZ classy/JJ yet/RB casual/JJ ./.
I/PRP love/VBP that/IN everything/NN cooked/VBD is/VBZ thrown/VBN into/IN the/DT blistering-hot/JJ brick/NN oven/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB like/IN the/DT non-pizza/JJ offerings/NNS and/CC look/VB forward/NN to/TO trying/VBG several/JJ of/IN those/DT as/RB well/RB ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT happy/NN hour/NN during/IN the/DT week/NN (/VBD M-Th/JJ 3-6PM/CD ,/, 8-9PM/CD &/CC F/NNP 3-6PM/NNP ,/, 8:30-10PM/CD )/NNS with/IN most/JJS selections/NNS at/IN $/$ 5/each/CD ./.
Really/RB good/JJ pizza/NN and/CC salad/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
They/PRP think/VBP they/PRP are/VBP fancy/JJ with/IN their/PRP$ wine/NN list/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB that/IN good/JJ of/IN a/DT wine/NN list/NN and/CC my/PRP$ wife/NN had/VBD a/DT sparkling/JJ wine/NN served/VBD in/IN a/DT red/VBN wine/NN glass/NN .../: yeah/NN ./.
Half/NNP of/IN it/PRP was/VBD wasted/VBN on/IN the/DT pour/NN ./.
Stick/NNP with/IN beer/NN here/RB ./.
The/DT Good/NNP :/: Our/NNP server/NN was/VBD really/RB nice/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN everyone/NN else/NN who/WP helped/VBD her/PRP out/IN ./.
The/DT Bad/NNP :/: Everything/NNP lacked/VBD flavor/NN from/IN start/NN to/TO finish/JJ ./.
Our/NNP app/VBD the/DT Bruschetta/NNP was/VBD horrible/JJ ,/, from/IN the/DT taste/NN and/CC texture/NN to/TO the/DT balsamic/NN that/IN was/VBD ``/`` artistically/RB ''/'' swirled/VBD in/IN the/DT center/NN ./.
The/DT pizza/NN I/PRP ordered/VBP which/WDT was/VBD the/DT Vico/NNP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB enough/VBN toppings/NNS .../: basically/RB a/DT white/JJ pizza/NN with/IN horrible/JJ inconsistent/NN cuts/NNS of/IN onions/NNS ,/, and/CC maybe/VB a/DT toddlers/NNS handful/NN of/IN meat/NN .../: no/DT joke/NN !/.
The/DT meat/NN on/IN the/DT pizza/NN was/VBD less/JJR than/IN 1/4/CD of/IN a/DT cup/NN ./.
The/DT canoli/NN was/VBD by/IN far/RB the/DT worst/NN canoli/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Paula/NNP Dean/NNP could/MD n't/RB even/RB save/VB this/DT dish/NN ./.
The/DT Worst/NNP :/: Both/DT pizzas/NNS were/VBD under/IN cooked/JJ ./.
Either/RB the/DT chef/NN really/RB did/VBD n't/RB care/VB because/IN we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN 35/CD minutes/NNS before/IN close/JJ or/CC because/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN 6+/CD walked/VBD in/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS before/IN close/JJ or/CC because/IN he/PRP was/VBD too/RB occupied/VBN making/VBG sure/JJ what/WP looked/VBN like/IN his/PRP$ family/NN was/VBD having/VBG a/DT better/JJR meal/NN than/IN anyone/NN else/RB ./.
I/PRP see/VBP and/CC hear/JJ people/NNS rave/VBP about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Regardless/NN of/IN the/DT friendly/JJ waitstaff/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB return/VB due/JJ lack/NN of/IN flavor/NN ,/, lack/NN of/IN originality/NN and/CC inability/NN to/TO make/VB something/NN so/RB simple/JJ as/IN pizza/NN cook/NN properly/RB ./.
Pros/NNS :/: Server/NNP was/VBD amazing/VBG Super/NNP clean/JJ Fast/NN and/CC hot/NN Smells/NNS amazing/VBG Crushed/JJ Ice/NN !/NN !/VBD !/NNP !/.
Cons/NNS :/: Awful/JJ Pizza/NNP $/$ 19/CD for/IN a/DT small/JJ pizza/NN with/IN one/CD topping/NN Greasy/NNP and/CC Soggy/NNP They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB pepperoni/VBN .../: just/RB salami/JJ No/NN lunch/NN specials/NNS
One/CD of/IN the/DT nice/JJ things/NNS about/IN running/VBG a/DT half/NN marathon/NN is/VBZ that/IN afterwards/NNS ,/, you/PRP can/MD eat/VB anything/NN you/PRP want/VBP ./.
So/RB after/IN burning/NN what/WP I/PRP tell/VBP myself/JJ must/MD have/VB been/VBN AT/NNP LEAST/NNP a/DT million/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN calories/VBZ in/IN the/DT Rock/NNP 'n/NNS '/POS Roll/NNP ,/, I/PRP told/VBD my/PRP$ parentals/NNS that/IN it/PRP was/VBD critical/JJ we/PRP get/VBP pizza/NN ./.

We/PRP rolled/VBD in/IN to/TO the/DT new/JJ location/NN of/IN Settebello/NNP and/CC the/DT place/NN is/VBZ an/DT Instagrammer/NN 's/POS dream/NN ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ a/DT very/RB refined/VBN ,/, elegant/JJ feel/NN to/TO it/PRP that/IN does/VBZ not/RB exude/VB ``/`` pizzeria/NN ''/'' in/IN the/DT slightest/JJS bit/NN ./.

La/NNP noche/NN began/VBD with/IN fried/JJ risotto/NN ,/, which/WDT were/VBD ravioli-like/JJ envelopes/NNS of/IN breaded/JJ risotto/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT beet/NN salad/JJ with/IN creamy/NN goat/NN cheese/NN and/CC nuts/NNS ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT risotto/NN could/MD have/VB stood/VBN on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ without/IN making/VBG a/DT detour/NN to/TO the/DT fryer/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT salad/NN was/VBD a/DT fresh/JJ complement/NN to/TO the/DT pizza/NN ./.
The/DT Family/NNP K/NNP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT Vico/NNP (/NNP sausage/NN ,/, fennel/NN ,/, onions/NNS ,/, mascarpone/NN ,/, mozzarella/NN ,/, basil/NN ,/, olive/JJ oil/NN )/NN and/CC Capriccioso/NNP (/NNP all/DT vegetables/NNS -/NNS do/VBP n't/RB even/RB bother/VB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT carnivore/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT final/JJ tally/NN had/VBD Vico/NNP in/IN the/DT lead/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD advised/VBN in/IN advance/NN that/IN the/DT thin-crust/JJ pizzas/NNS come/VBP out/RP slightly/RB charred/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT crust/NN on/IN our/PRP$ Capriccioso/NN was/VBD just/RB burnt/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP was/VBD Michelle/NNP Kwan/NNP that/IN night/NN and/CC not/RB Tara/NNP Lipinski/NNP ./.
We/PRP learned/VBD that/IN night/NN that/IN crushed/JJ tomato/NN is/VBZ OKAYYY/NNP but/CC we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB love/VB it/PRP ./.
Since/IN Settebello/NNP has/VBZ so/RB many/JJ options/NNS without/IN crushed/JJ tomatoes/NNS though/IN ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ we/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB again/RB sometime/JJ to/TO peruse/VB the/DT other/JJ items/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT family/NN night/NN and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN dying/VBG to/TO try/NNP Settebello/NNP for/IN the/DT longest/JJ time/NN and/CC it/PRP just/RB so/IN happened/JJ I/PRP saw/VBD that/IN there/NN was/VBD one/CD close/NN to/TO us/PRP ./.

I/PRP highly/VBP recommend/JJ this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT worse/NN pizza/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN hands/VBN down/RB ./.

The/DT pizza/NN was/VBD limp/NN and/CC not/RB crispy/JJ all/PDT the/DT way/NN through/IN .../: ..so/NN u/NN can/MD understand/VB when/WRB u/JJ grab/NN a/DT piece/NN and/CC everything/NN falls/NNS off/RP because/IN the/DT center/NN is/VBZ not/RB cooked/VBN all/PDT the/DT way/NN .../: .my/NN salad/VBD that/IN came/VBD out/RP first/RB had/VBD line/VBN pine/NN nuts/NNS that/IN I/PRP asked/VBD to/TO take/VB off/RP still/RB came/VBD to/TO the/DT table/JJ with/IN them/PRP .../VBP .had/RB to/TO remake/VB the/DT salad/NN and/CC our/PRP$ pizza/NN took/VBD about/IN 20/CD min/NN to/TO come/VB out/RP ./.

I/PRP 'd/VBP never/RB been/VBN before/IN but/CC a/DT friend/NN constantly/RB raves/VBZ about/IN the/DT place/NN so/RB when/WRB visiting/VBG this/DT time/NN ,/, we/PRP made/VBD this/DT the/DT final/JJ gathering/NN place/NN for/IN the/DT trip/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC helpful/JJ and/CC saw/JJ to/TO it/PRP that/IN we/PRP got/VBD a/DT great/JJ seat/NN for/IN our/PRP$ party/NN of/IN 10/CD ./.
First/NNP stop/NNP ?/.
The/DT bar/NN while/IN waiting/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN to/TO arrive/VB ./.
The/DT wine/NN list/NN is/VBZ somewhat/JJ limited/NN with/IN only/RB a/DT few/JJ whites/NNS by/IN the/DT glass/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC dry/JJ ,/, not/RB sweet/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT fruity/NN linger/NN ./.

I/PRP started/VBD off/RP with/IN another/DT glass/NN of/IN Pinot/NN to/TO go/VB along/IN with/IN my/PRP$ salad/NN ./.
We/PRP shared/VBD a/DT beet/NN salad/NN and/CC the/DT Insalata/NNP Grande/NNP ,/, which/WDT in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN was/VBD the/DT better/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD ./.

On/IN rare/JJ occasions/NNS I/PRP 'm/VBP willing/JJ to/TO violate/VB my/PRP$ glutard/NN status/NN ./.

What/WP I/PRP love/VBP about/RB Settebello/NNP is/VBZ that/IN this/DT style/NN of/IN pizza/NN features/NNS a/DT super/NN thin/JJ crust/NN that/WDT is/VBZ loaded/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ and/CC abundant/JJ toppings/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ baked/VBN fresh/JJ in/IN a/DT wood-burning/JJ oven/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB true/JJ Italian/JJ style/NN pizza/NN ,/, not/RB American/JJ style/NN or/CC Chicago/NNP style/NN or/CC NY/NNP Style/NNP ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP expecting/VBG this/DT then/NN do/VBP n't/RB do/VB n't/RB come/VB here/RB ./.

I/PRP found/VBD the/DT pizza/NN to/TO be/VB soft/JJ and/CC foldable/JJ yet/NNS at/IN times/NNS it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN easier/VBN to/TO eat/VB this/DT with/IN a/DT knife/NN and/CC fork/NN ,/, which/WDT by/IN New/NNP York/NNP standards/NNP Is/NNP a/DT massive/JJ NO-NO/NN ./.

The/DT blackened/VBD char/NN spots/NNS on/IN the/DT pizza/NN crust/NN is/VBZ a/DT tell-tale/JJ sign/NN of/IN Pizza/NNP Napoletana/NNP that/IN has/VBZ been/VBN cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT blistering/JJ hot/NN ,/, wood/VBD burning/NN oven/NN so/RB do/VBP n't/RB fret/VB if/IN you/PRP see/VBP some/DT burnt/NN crust/NN ./.

Mine/NNP was/VBD a/DT ``/`` bianca/NN ''/'' with/IN just/RB mozzarella/JJ arugula/NN and/CC parmigiano/NN but/CC I/PRP added/VBD basil/NN and/CC Kalamata/NNP olives/NNS ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD ordered/VBN a/DT basic/JJ pizza/NN Margherita/NNP ./.
Both/DT pizzas/NNS were/VBD nicely/RB charred/VBN around/IN the/DT edges/NNS but/CC the/DT interiors/NNS were/VBD slightly/RB gummy/JJ ./.
Having/NNP said/VBD this/DT I/PRP do/VBP think/RB a/DT little/JJ longer/NN in/IN the/DT wood/NN fired/VBD oven/VBN would/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT answer/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT base/NN nicely/RB crispier/JJR ./.
The/DT pizzas/NNS tasted/VBD very/RB pleasant/JJ even/RB so/RB ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP 3/JJ desserts/NNS to/TO get/VB the/DT feel/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
A/DT Tiramisu/NNP ,/, some/DT zeppole/NN and/CC a/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ torta/NN chocolate/NN cake/NN ./.
All/DT desserts/NNS were/VBD delightful/JJ but/CC the/DT Nutella/NNP free/JJ zeppole/NN were/VBD the/DT best/JJ I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN outside/IN of/IN Italy/NNP ./.
The/DT bill/NN was/VBD around/IN $/$ 93/CD but/CC all/DT things/NNS considered/NNS ,/, this/DT was/VBD indeed/VBN value/NN for/IN money/NN due/JJ to/TO us/PRP ordering/VBG far/RB more/JJR than/IN most/JJS people/NNS would/MD even/RB consider/VB eating/JJ ./.
An/DT espresso/NN following/VBG the/DT meal/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC rounded/VBD off/RP my/PRP$ early/JJ dinner/NN very/RB adequately/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD highly/RB recommend/VB Settebello/NNP but/CC suggest/NNP an/DT early/JJ or/CC late/JJ visit/NN because/IN I/PRP think/VBP this/DT place/NN would/MD be/VB overflowing/VBG at/IN normal/JJ times/NNS to/TO dine/VB ./.
We/PRP left/VBD here/RB at/IN 6pm/CD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD filling/VBG up/RP quickly/RB ./.
A+++/NNP for/IN this/DT local/JJ eatery/NN ./.
FIRE/NNP OVEN/NNP Grabbed/NNP some/DT pizzas/NNS from/IN here/RB for/IN lunch/NN &/CC it/PRP was/VBD AMAZING/NNP !/NNP !/.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO do/VB togo/NN becuase/NN we/PRP had/VBD people/VBN waiting/VBG at/IN home/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC frequent/JJ in/IN making/NNP sure/NNP their/PRP$ guests/NNS were/VBD taken/VBN care/NN of/IN ./.
It/PRP literally/RB only/RB took/VBD 15/CD minutes/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ pizzas/NNS to/TO be/VB ready/NN from/IN the/DT moment/NN we/PRP placed/VBP our/VBN orders/NNS ./.
We/PRP got/VBD the/DT pizza/NN of/IN the/DT week/NN with/IN pesto/NNP sauce/NNP &/CC tomato/NNP w//NNP garlic/NN which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD hands/VBN down/RP AWSOME/NNP !/.
Bianca/NNP was/VBD another/DT one/CD we/NN got/NN with/IN the/DT balsamic/JJ reduction/NN !/.
We/PRP got/VBD one/CD other/JJ pizza/NN but/CC i/NN forgot/NN the/DT name../NN
The/DT dough/NN was/VBD chewy/NN and/CC crispy/NN !/.
So/RB good/JJ &/CC you/PRP could/MD just/RB tell/VB the/DT cheese/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ !/.
Definately/NNP will/MD be/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB the/DT dining/NN experience/NN more/RBR &/CC the/DT pizza/NN would/MD probably/RB taste/VB so/RB much/JJ better/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ Hot/NNP !/.

Fresh/NNP ingredients/NNS ./.

We/PRP had/VBD an/DT early/JJ lunch/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB busy/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
My/NNP husband/NN has/VBZ never/RB had/VBD the/DT Neapolitan/NNP pizza/NN but/CC he/PRP loved/VBD the/DT flavor/NN ./.
I/PRP hate/VBP that/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO travel/NN 4/NN hours/NNS by/IN plane/NN to/TO enjoy/VB this/DT ./.
So/RB this/DT pizza/NN was/VBD really/RB interesting/JJ ./.
Gluten-free/NN pizzas/NNS in/IN other/JJ restaurants/NNS usually/RB taste/VBP like/IN really/RB bad/JJ microwaved/VBN pizzas/NNS ,/, but/CC Settebello/NNP 's/POS recipe/NN was/VBD totally/RB different/JJ ./.
Their/NNP gluten/VBD free/JJ pizza/NN had/VBD like/IN a/DT naan/JJ bread/JJ base/NN (/NN which/WDT is/VBZ probably/RB just/RB Napoli-style/JJ ;/: I/PRP have/VBP never/RB had/VBD it/PRP before/RB ,/, though/IN ,/, and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT closest/NN comparison/NN I/PRP can/MD draw/VB !/NN )/.
and/CC fresh/JJ ingredients/NNS piled/VBD on/IN top/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP definitely/RB not/RB American/JJ pizzas/NNS ;/: they/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB authentic/JJ Italian/JJ taste/NN (/NN especially/RB the/DT sauce/JJ )/NN ./.
The/DT hostess/NN said/VBD pretty/RB much/JJ anything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN can/MD be/VB made/VBN gluten/JJ free/NN for/IN just/RB $/$ 4/CD extra/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD incredibly/RB accommodating/VBG ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD at/IN around/IN 5PM/CD on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB very/RB crowded/VBN and/CC service/NN was/VBD incredibly/RB quick/JJ (/IN the/DT pizzas/NN came/VBD around/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS after/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP )/RB ./.
The/DT ambiance/NN was/VBD really/RB nice/JJ ,/, too/RB ;/: it/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB tastefully/JJ decorated/VBN and/CC would/MD probably/RB make/VB a/DT great/JJ date/NN night/NN ./.

But/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO get/VB full/JJ and/CC eat/VB a/DT delicious/JJ Napoletana/NNP Pizza/NNP .../: this/DT is/VBZ your/VBG spot/NN ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP order/VBG the/DT Emilia/NNP ./.
Italian/JJ Creme/JJ instead/NN of/IN the/DT tomotoe/NN sauce/NN .../: prosciutto/NN ,/, cotto/NN ,/, mozarella/NN ,/, that/IN fresh/JJ basil/NN .../: .mmm/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP getting/VBG hungry/NN just/RB thinking/VBG about/IN it/PRP !/.
If/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN red/VBN sauce/NN .../: I/PRP 'll/MD order/VB the/DT Settebello/NNP ,/, This/DT is/VBZ the/DT closest/NN you/PRP 'll/MD get/VB to/TO tasting/VBG real/JJ italian/JJ pizza/NN .../: and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT lot/NN cheaper/JJR than/IN airfare/NN ./.
So/RB thankful/JJ the/DT summerlin/NN Settebello/NNP opened/NNP ./.
Now/RB my/VBD family/NN does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB to/TO travel/NN all/PDT the/DT way/NN to/TO the/DT Green/NNP Valley/NNP District/NNP for/IN a/DT taste/NN of/IN Italy/NNP ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD OK/NNP ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB recommended/VBN by/IN a/DT friend/NN and/CC brought/VBD along/IN 3/CD other/JJ friends/NNS ./.
The/DT pizza/NN was/VBD mediocre/RB ./.
I/PRP can/MD honestly/RB say/VB Metro/NNP Pizza/NNP has/VBZ WAY/NNP better/RBR pizza/NN than/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD cool/JJ ,/, Even/RB though/IN it/PRP took/VBD him/PRP 10/CD years/NNS to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ friend/NN her/PRP long/RB island/VBP ice/JJ tea/NN drink/NN ./.

One/CD was/VBD bigger/JJR than/IN the/DT other/JJ and/CC the/DT smaller/NN one/CD was/VBD burnt/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD worth/VBG the/DT price/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB good/JJ ./.

A/DT nice/JJ ambiance/NN ,/, reasonable/JJ prices/NNS and/CC most/RBS importantly/RB for/IN me/PRP is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ awareness/NN for/IN the/DT Gluten-free/JJ needs/NN of/IN those/DT who/WP request/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ improvement/NN would/MD be/VB service/NN ,/, the/DT servers/NNS do/VBP a/DT good/JJ job/NN but/CC each/DT time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP gone/JJ there/EX is/VBZ simply/RB not/RB enough/RB of/IN them/PRP ./.

We/PRP ordered/VBP 2/RB Margherita/NNP DOC/NNP :/: Crushed/NNP Tomatoes/NNP ,/, Fresh/NNP Buffalo/NNP Mozzarella/NNP ,/, Basil/NNP ,/, Parmigiano/NNP Reggiano/NNP ,/, Extra/NNP Virgin/NNP Olive/NNP Oil/NNP ,/, 1/CD Vico/NNP (/NNP No/NNP Crushed/NNP Tomatoes/NNPS )/NN :/: Wood/NNP Oven/NNP Sausage/NNP ,/, Sauteed/NNP Fennel/NNP ,/, Red/NNP Onions/NNPS ,/, Mascarpone/NNP ,/, Mozzarella/NNP ,/, Basil/NNP ,/, Extra/NNP Virgin/NNP Olive/NNP Oil/NNP and/CC 1/CD with/IN salami/JJ and/CC cheese/NN (/NN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB pepperoni/JJ here/RB and/CC will/MD give/VB you/PRP salami/VB if/IN you/PRP order/VBP it/PRP )/-NONE- ./.
Everyone/NNP started/VBD to/TO dig/VB in/IN on/IN the/DT pizzas/NN and/CC all/DT looked/VBN at/IN each/DT other/JJ like/IN what/WP the/DT hell/NN is/VBZ this/DT ?/NN
The/DT first/JJ couple/NN were/VBD so/RB hungry/JJ that/IN they/PRP went/VBD ahead/RB and/CC ate/RB theirs/NNS ./.
The/DT BF/NNP hesitated/VBD to/TO eat/VB his/PRP$ and/CC I/PRP could/MD no/VB way/NN eat/NN another/DT bite/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD the/DT worst/NN COLD/NNP pizza/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD for/IN the/DT waitress/NN that/IN did/VBD not/RB come/VB back/RB for/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
The/DT BF/NN was/VBD so/RB hungry/JJ he/PRP decided/VBD to/TO go/VB ahead/RB and/CC eat/VB his/PRP$ but/NN did/VBD not/RB like/IN it/PRP at/IN all/DT ./.
When/WRB the/DT waitress/NN finally/RB showed/VBD back/RB up/IN I/PRP told/VBD her/PRP this/DT was/VBD the/DT most/RBS flavorless/JJ ,/, disgusting/JJ cold/NN pizza/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
It/PRP also/RB looked/VBD liked/VBN someone/NN had/VBD poured/VBN a/DT cup/NN of/IN water/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT waitress/NN informed/VBD me/PRP that/IN Fresh/NNP Buffalo/NNP Mozzarella/NNP is/VBZ a/DT watery/NN cheese/NN ./.
LOL/NNP !/NNP !/.
Oh/NNP and/CC let/NNP me/NNP also/RB say/VBP that/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT pizzas/NNS were/VBD burned/VBN (/JJ like/IN charred/VBN black/NN on/IN the/DT bottom/NN )/NN ./.
Yes/NNS --/: I/PRP know/VBP these/DT are/VBP cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT brick/JJ oven/NN but/CC burnt/NN is/VBZ burnt/JJ people/NNS ./.

She/PRP took/VBD it/PRP away/RB and/CC when/WRB she/PRP walked/VBD in/IN to/TO the/DT kitchen/NN she/PRP must/MD have/VB said/VBN something/NN because/IN everyone/NN that/IN was/VBD standing/VBG back/RB there/RB all/DT turned/NN around/IN at/IN once/RB staring/JJ at/IN me/PRP ./.

She/PRP came/VBD back/RP a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS later/JJ and/CC said/VBD the/DT manager/NN was/VBD at/IN the/DT store/NN but/CC would/MD take/VB it/PRP off/IN my/PRP$ check/NN when/WRB he/PRP returned/VBD ./.
I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN that/IN the/DT manager/NN never/RB came/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ table/JJ to/TO apologize/VB or/CC offer/VB me/PRP something/NN else/RB ./.
So/RB our/RB check/NN came/VBD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD $/$ 166/CD ./.
Wow/NNP --/: that/IN is/VBZ outrageous/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN food/NN we/PRP were/VBD just/RB served/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP well/RB aware/JJ of/IN how/WRB this/DT food/NN should/NN taste/NN ./.

Finally/RB made/VBD it/PRP out/IN here/RB for/IN happy/NN hour/NN ,/, celebrating/VBG the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT school/NN year/NN !/.
Surprised/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN they/PRP only/RB had/VBD one/CD other/JJ table/JJ during/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN ,/, so/RB service/NN was/VBD fast/RB ./.
Ordered/IN a/DT Dogfishhead/NNP IPA/NNP (/VBD $/$ 3/CD off/CD during/IN HH/NNP )/NNP ,/, and/CC each/DT of/IN the/DT following/VBG dishes/NNS for/IN a/DT mere/RB $/$ 5/CD each/DT :/: bruschetta/NN appetizer/NN ,/, warm/NN beets/VBZ ``/`` snack/NN ''/'' ,/, and/CC the/DT Margherita/NNP and/CC Vico/NNP mini/NNP pizzas/NNS ./.
For/IN $/$ 25/CD before/IN tip/NN ,/, this/DT was/VBD a/DT filling/JJ but/CC light/JJ early/JJ dinner/NN ./.
The/DT apps/NNS were/VBD delish/JJ :/: bruschetta/NN is/VBZ my/VBN BF/NNP 's/POS favorite/JJ ,/, and/CC here/RB the/DT crostini/NN is/VBZ topped/VBN with/IN bacon/NN and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT side/NN of/IN pesto/NN for/IN extra/JJ flavor/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
The/DT warm/NN beets/VBZ were/VBD divine/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ ,/, served/VBD in/IN a/DT mini/NN cast-iron/JJ dish/JJ and/CC topped/VBD with/IN peanuts/NNS ./.
The/DT mini/NN pizzas/NNS were/VBD n't/RB that/IN mini-/NN do/VBP n't/RB know/VB the/DT size/NN compares/VBZ with/IN their/PRP$ usual/JJ since/IN this/DT was/VBD our/VBN first/JJ visit/NN ,/, but/CC server/NN let/NN us/PRP know/VBD that/IN the/DT usual/JJ pizzas/NNS are/VBP 12/VBN ''/'' and/CC intended/VBD to/TO be/VB an/DT individual/JJ size/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT thinness/NN of/IN the/DT crust/NN style/NN ./.
Ordering/IN two/CD mini/JJ pizzas/NNS (/VBP maybe/NN 8/NNS ''/'' ?/NN )/.
was/VBD enough/RB for/IN us/PRP to/TO share/NN without/IN feeling/NN like/IN we/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO explode/VB afterward/NN ./.
Margherita/NNP style/NN was/VBD my/JJ favorite/JJ ,/, as/IN the/DT classic/JJ tomato-and-cheese/NN combo/NN is/VBZ just/RB what/WP I/PRP naturally/RB crave/VBP when/WRB I/PRP think/VBP of/IN pizza/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP love/VB the/DT complementary/JJ flavors/NNS of/IN fresh/JJ basil/NN ./.
BF/NNP preferred/VBD the/DT Vico/NNP ,/, with/IN sausage/NN ,/, fennel/NN ,/, mozzarella/NN ,/, moscarpone/NN ,/, and/CC red/VBD onions-/JJ quality/NN ingredients/NNS and/CC good/JJ depth/NN of/IN flavor/NN ./.
While/IN he/PRP liked/VBD this/DT topping/NN combination/NN better/NN ,/, my/PRP$ dude/NN simply/RB did/VBD n't/RB love/VB the/DT thin/NN ,/, wet/JJ crust/NN style/NN served/VBN here/RB and/CC it/PRP may/MD be/VB tricky/JJ to/TO get/VB him/PRP back/RB in/IN ./.

Perfection/NNP and/CC simplicity/NN ./.
This/DT pizza/NN is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP I/PRP had/VBD in/IN Napoli/NNP ,/, Italy/NNP years/NNS before/IN ./.
The/DT crust/NN is/VBZ thin/JJ and/CC chewy/JJ flavored/VBN with/IN the/DT wood-fired/JJ oven/NN ./.
The/DT red/VBD sauce/NN is/VBZ also/RB wonderful/JJ ,/, light/JJ and/CC tangy/NN ,/, they/PRP must/MD use/VB fresh/JJ tomatoes/NNS as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ that/IN have/VB the/DT strong/JJ ``/`` tomato/NN paste/NN ''/'' flavor/NN as/IN many/JJ other/JJ pizzerias/NNS have/VBP ./.
Go/NNP and/CC enjoy/JJ true/JJ Napoli/NNP style/NN pizza/NN ./.
Does/NNP not/RB disappoint/JJ ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP frequent/JJ Settebello/NNP because/IN of/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ close/JJ proximity/NN to/TO our/PRP$ office/NN and/CC the/DT exceptional/JJ food/service/NN we/PRP 've/VBP received/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, today/NN was/VBD not/RB one/CD of/IN those/DT days/NNS ./.
We/PRP arrived/VBD begore/IN the/DT typical/JJ lunch/NN rush/NN at/IN noon/NN and/CC were/VBD seated/VBN ./.
The/DT new/JJ waitres/NNS was/VBD obviously/RB frazzled/VBN already/RB ./.
We/PRP oredered/VBD our/PRP$ usual/JJ lunch/NN special/NN -/JJ two/CD pizzas/NNS and/CC two/CD salads/NNS for/IN $/$ 22/CD ./.
The/DT new/JJ girl/NN then/RB informed/VBD us/PRP we/PRP could/MD not/RB order/VB what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBP ,/, even/RB after/IN we/PRP assured/VBD her/PRP that/IN we/PRP would/MD pay/VB the/DT difference/NN for/IN the/DT additional/JJ toppings/NNS like/IN we/PRP have/VBP everytime/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.
She/PRP got/VBD offended/VBN and/CC told/VBD us/PRP the/DT other/JJ girl/NN (/IN the/DT usual/JJ waitress/NN that/WDT has/VBZ served/VBN us/PRP for/IN the/DT last/JJ year/NN or/CC so/RB )/JJ was/VBD fired/VBN and/CC that/IN ot/NN was/VBD because/IN of/IN people/NNS like/IN us/PRP modifying/JJ our/NN order/NN ./.
We/PRP decided/VBD to/TO stay/NNP and/CC order/VBD the/DT special/NN and/CC the/DT side/NN salads/VBZ since/IN we/PRP had/VBD already/RB been/VBN served/VBN our/PRP$ drinks/NNS ./.
Our/NNP salads/VBZ finally/RB came/VBD ,/, but/CC by/IN this/DT time/NN several/JJ other/JJ people/NNS had/VBD shown/VBN up/RP for/IN lunch/NN ./.
She/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT only/JJ person/NN hosting/NN and/CC waiting/VBG tables/NNS as/IN it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB hard/JJ to/TO get/VB her/PRP attention/NN ./.
Our/NNP pizza/NN came/VBD out/RP of/IN the/DT oven/NN and/CC sat/NN on/IN the/DT counter/NN for/IN several/JJ mintues/NNS before/IN she/PRP came/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT back/NN and/CC finally/RB cut/VB it/PRP and/CC brought/VB it/PRP to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
Sadly/RB it/PRP was/VBD now/RB cold/JJ ,/, but/CC had/VBD the/DT promise/NN of/IN being/VBG a/DT pretty/NN tasty/NN pizza/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP asked/VBD to/TO settle/VB up/RP for/IN the/DT salad/JJ and/CC drinks/VBZ ,/, and/CC told/VBD her/PRP our/PRP$ pizza/NN was/VBD cold/JJ she/PRP proceeded/VBD to/TO walk/NN over/IN to/TO the/DT manager/NN and/CC tell/NN him/PRP we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB the/DT pizza/NN and/CC so/IN the/DT very/RB nice/JJ man/NN came/VBD over/IN and/CC gave/VBD us/PRP a/DT free/JJ pizza/NN coupon/NN for/IN our/PRP$ next/JJ visit/NN ./.
(/NN But/CC to/TO be/VB clear/JJ ,/, no/DT we/PRP actually/RB thought/VBD the/DT flavor/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC eating/VBG a/DT cold/NN pizza/NN was/VBD not/RB to/TO be/VB desired/VBN and/CC trying/VBG to/TO flag/NN down/IN this/DT waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB difficult/JJ )/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT kudos/NNS to/TO the/DT manager/NN ,/, he/PRP obviously/RB cares/VBZ about/IN his/PRP$ customers/NNS ,/, especially/RB ones/VBD that/IN come/NNP almost/RB once/RB a/DT week/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP the/DT other/JJ girl/NN who/WP used/-NONE- to/TO work/VB there/NN was/VBD fired/NN for/IN being/VBG nice/NN and/CC accommodating/VBG to/TO her/PRP$ customer/NN ,/, who/WP knows/NNS ,/, I/PRP can/MD only/RB go/VB by/IN what/WP the/DT new/JJ waitress/NN told/VBD us/PRP (/NNS who/WP even/RB says/VBZ stuff/NN like/IN that/DT to/TO customers/NNS ?/. )/.
but/CC I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT service/NN was/VBD terrible/JJ
First/NNP time/NN here/RB and/CC will/MD definitely/RB return/VB !/.
Pizza/NNP is/VBZ thin/JJ crust/NN ./.
Not/RB greasy/JJ like/IN some/DT other/JJ chain/NN pizza/NN joints/NNS ./.
Nice/NNP atmosphere/RB for/IN a/DT date/NN but/CC can/MD also/RB be/VB family/VBN friendly/RB ./.
Best/NNP part/NN was/VBD the/DT cannoli/NN !/.
Yummy/NNP !/.
Came/NN here/VBD a/DT second/JJ time/NN to/TO have/VB dinner/NN with/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN friends/NNS and/CC the/DT experience/NN was/VBD much/JJ better/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Emila/NNP Pizza/NNP again/RB but/CC this/DT time/NN they/PRP said/VBD they/PRP could/MD n't/RB add/VB because/IN ot/NN was/VBD an/DT Italian/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB make/VB chicken/VBN ?/. ?/.
Either/RB way/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB the/DT best/JJS pizza/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN !/.
And/CC of/IN course/NN the/DT cannolis/NNS are/VBP to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
Cool/NNP decor/NN ,/, the/DT service/NN was/VBD n't/RB really/RB good/JJ for/IN start/NN we/PRP order/VBP just/RB water/VBN and/CC soda/JJ but/CC my/JJ friend/NN ordered/VBD a/DT beer/NN in/IN a/DT wine/NN glass/NN (/IN she/PRP is/VBZ very/RB picky/JJ )/NN our/NN server/NN said/VBD there/EX was/VBD a/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT beer/NN and/CC he/PRP will/MD get/VB as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.
About/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ we/PRP forgot/NN who/WP our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD ./.
Finally/RB the/DT beer/NN came/VBD but/CC not/RB in/IN a/DT bear/JJ glass/NN not/RB a/DT wine/NN glass/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN made/VBD up/RP for/IN that/DT though/IN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB fresh/JJ and/CC tasty/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC the/DT staff/NN are/VBP very/RB friendly/RB ,/, funny/NNP ,/, &/CC helpful/JJ ./.
Totally/RB my/JJ new/JJ favorite/JJ !/NN
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ atmosphere/NN ,/, clean/JJ floors/tables/NNS ,/, great/JJ service/NN and/CC perfect/NN pizza/NN ./.
The/DT variety/NN is/VBZ the/DT key/JJ because/IN you/PRP can/MD just/RB keep/VB coming/VBG back/RB and/CC experimenting/VBG with/IN all/PDT the/DT unique/JJ combinations/NNS ./.
Personally/RB I/PRP like/IN the/DT jalapeño/NN and/CC the/DT margarita/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB forget/JJ to/TO save/VB some/DT room/NN for/IN the/DT tiramisu/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ spot/NN for/IN a/DT date/NN ,/, group/NN of/IN friends/NNS or/CC the/DT whole/JJ family/NN ./.
I/PRP felt/VBD like/IN I/PRP was/VBD at/IN home/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN and/CC was/VBD greeted/VBN promptly/RB ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ upscale/JJ quality/NN with/IN reasonable/JJ pricing/NN which/WDT always/RB makes/VBZ me/PRP happy/NN ./.
Also/RB the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD hearty/NN and/CC not/RB skimpy/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD tell/VB that/IN the/DT meat/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC well/RB prepped/VBD and/CC not/RB just/RB thrown/VBN on/IN at/IN the/DT last/JJ minuet/NN like/IN most/JJS pizzerias/NNS are/VBP doing/VBG these/DT days/NNS .../:
Overall/IN I/PRP just/RB had/VBD to/TO give/VB a/DT five/NN because/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ so/RB well/RB rounded/VBN and/CC after/IN multiple/JJ visits/NNS the/DT consistency/NN in/IN quality/NN really/RB won/VBD me/PRP over/IN ./.
With/IN all/PDT the/DT fantastic/JJ pizza/NN places/NNS here/RB ,/, I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC base/VB my/PRP$ rating/NN off/IN ratings/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP given/VBN to/TO other/JJ pizza/NN spots/NNS ./.
This/DT was/VBD our/VBN first/JJ visit/NN to/TO this/DT location/NN and/CC my/PRP$ rating/NN is/VBZ probably/RB closer/NN to/TO 3/VB 1/2/CD stars/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB our/PRP$ experience/NN was/VBD worth/JJ 4/NN stars/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN quickly/RB and/CC ordered/VBD the/DT meatballs/NNS and/CC capricciosa/NN pizza/NN ./.
The/DT meatballs/NNS were/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ,/, a/DT little/JJ bland/NN without/IN the/DT sauce/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT bread/NN that/IN accompanied/JJ it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
In/IN theory/JJ I/PRP liked/VBD all/DT of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS in/IN the/DT pizza/NN -/JJ artichoke/NN ,/, prosciutto/NN ,/, olives/NNS ,/, mushrooms/NNS ,/, mozzarella/NN ,/, basil/NN ./.
What/NN 's/VBZ not/RB to/TO like/VB ?/.
But/CC together/RB ,/, it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB work/VB ./.
I/PRP think/VBP if/IN they/PRP used/VBP black/JJ olives/NNS instead/RB of/IN kalamata/NN and/CC chopped/VBD the/DT artichoke/NN hearts/VBZ a/DT bit/NN smaller/NN (/IN instead/NN of/IN huge/JJ chunks/NNS )/NN ,/, and/CC added/VBD more/RBR mushrooms/NNS and/CC prosciutto/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD 've/VB been/VBN 10/CD times/NNS better/RBR ./.
I/PRP do/VBP like/IN the/DT thin/JJ crust/NN and/CC cooking/VBG it/PRP in/IN a/DT wood/NN fired/NN oven/VBN gives/VBZ it/PRP a/DT rustic/JJ flavor/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD decent/JJ ,/, not/RB great/JJ ,/, not/RB terrible/JJ ./.
We/PRP probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB anytime/JJ soon/RB though/IN :/: //.

The/DT one/CD star/NN off/NN is/VBZ for/IN the/DT settebello/NN pizza/NN ;/: it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ too/NN except/IN I/PRP felt/VBP like/IN the/DT marinara/NN sauce/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ too/NN acidic/NN and/CC there/EX was/VBD too/RB much/JJ sauce/NN on/IN this/DT pizza/NN ./.

I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT pizza/NN was/VBD undercooked/JJ -/JJ very/RB slight/JJ charring/NN on/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT pizza/NN crust/NN ,/, The/DT mozzarella/NN was/VBD not/RB melted/VBN ,/, a/DT boatload/NN of/IN pine/NN nuts/NNS ,/, yet/RB very/RB light/JJ on/IN mushroom../NN

After/IN 40/CD minutes/NNS I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO check/NN on/IN how/WRB many/JJ people/NNS were/VBD left/VBN ahead/RB of/IN us/PRP ./.
My/NNP group/NN did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO wait/VB much/RB longer/JJR ./.
The/DT hostess/NN looked/VBD up/RP my/PRP$ name/NN and/CC said/VBD two/CD tables/NNS in/IN front/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.

I/PRP was/VBD impressed/VBN by/IN this/DT pizzeria/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ visit/NN to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD for/IN a/DT meeting/NN with/IN a/DT party/NN of/IN 8/CD ./.
We/PRP were/VBD shown/VBN to/TO the/DT private/JJ room/NN that/WDT was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ tight/NN for/IN our/PRP$ group/NN but/CC luckily/RB we/PRP all/DT enjoy/NN each/DT other/JJ 's/NN company/NN and/CC did/VBD n't/RB mind/VB the/DT closeness/NN ./.
The/DT chairs/NNS were/VBD put/VBN together/RP with/IN no/DT space/NN between/IN ,/, so/RB anyone/RB with/IN a/DT big/JJ party/NN BEWARE/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD all/DT delicious/JJ ,/, they/PRP kept/VBD our/PRP$ drinks/NNS filled/VBD and/CC sold/VBD us/PRP on/IN dessert/NN ./.
Of/NNP everything/NN ,/, the/DT risotto/NN balls/NNS were/VBD the/DT best/JJS appetizer/NN ,/, we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB a/DT single/JJ bad/JJ pizza/NN but/CC the/DT Blanca/NNP special/NNP was/VBD very/RB delicious/JJ ,/, and/CC you/PRP can/MD never/RB go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN Nutella/NNP pizza/NN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
Skip/IN the/DT custard/NN doughnuts/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, I/PRP did/VBD not/RB really/RB enjoy/VB the/DT food/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT settebello/NN and/CC carbonara/NN pizzas/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB alright/JJ ./.
You/PRP can/MD definitely/RB taste/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN their/PRP$ pizza/NN and/CC a/DT regular/JJ pizza/NN from/IN papa/NN john/NN 's/POS ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD give/VB them/PRP that/IN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB in/IN love/JJ with/IN it/PRP ./.
We/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT cannoli/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD meh/JJ ./.
Settebello/NNP is/VBZ has/VBZ a/DT cool/NN vibe/NN and/CC great/JJ ambiance/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP tucked/VBN away/RB inside/VB the/DT Village/NN Square/RB where/WRB the/DT movie/NN theater/NN is/VBZ ./.
It/PRP a/DT small/JJ restaurant/NN with/IN maybe/NN a/DT 10/CD seat/NN bar/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD see/VB the/DT brick/NN oven/VBN right/NN when/WRB you/PRP come/VBP in/IN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT small/JJ menu/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP some/DT random/NN salads/NNS and/CC even/RB some/DT yummy/JJ desserts/NNS but/CC I/PRP was/VBD there/RB for/IN the/DT pizza/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN found/VBD this/DT place/NN when/WRB she/PRP first/RB started/VBD dating/VBG her/PRP current/JJ bae/NN ./.
She/PRP pushed/VBD me/PRP to/TO come/VB and/CC said/VBD its/PRP$ the/DT best/JJS pizza/NN she/PRP has/VBZ had/VBN aside/NN from/IN Italy/NNP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN your/PRP$ normal/JJ Pizza/NNP hut/NN or/CC Domino/NNP 's/POS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ thin/JJ and/CC toasty/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP the/DT Diavola/NNP ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ crushed/VBN tomatoes/NNS ,/, peppered/VBD salame/JJ ,/, roasted/VBN red/VBD bell/NN peppers/NNS ,/, crushed/VBD red/VBN peppers/NNS ,/, garlic/NN ,/, mozzarella/NN ,/, and/CC Extra/NNP Virgin/NNP Olive/NNP Oil/NNP ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP eating/VBG two/CD regular/JJ slices/NNS of/IN pizza/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP some/DT nutella/NN based/NNS dessert/NN which/WDT are/VBP a/DT must/NN try/NN at/IN least/JJS once/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD zeppole/JJ for/IN best/JJS friend/NN 's/POS birthday/NN and/CC they/PRP made/VBD them/PRP a/DT little/JJ different/JJ since/IN she/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB like/VB nutella/NN ./.
They/PRP made/VBD them/PRP will/MD the/DT nutella/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN and/CC added/VBD cinnamon/NN which/WDT was/VBD really/RB cool/JJ of/IN them/PRP to/TO do/VB to/TO ./.
We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT few/JJ times/NNS now/RB and/CC I/PRP think/VBP best/JJ friend/NN is/VBZ right/RB ./.
They/PRP hire/VBP pretty/RB people/NNS ./.
All/DT of/IN them/PRP are/VBP pretty/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT random/NN thing/NN to/TO say/VB but/CC when/WRB they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB how/WRB to/TO get/VB ice/NN off/IN a/DT table/JJ it/PRP kind/-NONE- of/IN makes/NN me/NN laugh/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT little/JJ accident/NN and/CC split/VB a/DT yummy/JJ Mint/NNP Collins/NNP ./.
It/PRP took/VBD a/DT couple/NN trips/NNS to/TO get/VB it/PRP cleaned/VBD up/RP then/RB someone/NN put/VBD our/PRP$ new/JJ napkins/NNS right/NN in/IN the/DT wet/JJ spot/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB dropped/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT drink/NN on/IN my/PRP$ phone/NN and/CC did/VBD n't/RB apologize/VB or/CC even/RB acknowledge/VB it/PRP ./.

Overall/IN its/PRP$ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO grab/VB a/DT pizza/NN and/CC sit/NN and/CC talk/NN with/IN friends/NNS ./.
The/DT flavors/NNS in/IN the/DT pizza/NN are/VBP great/JJ and/CC different/JJ from/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP a/DT softspot/NN for/IN Settebello/NNP &/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP really/RB not/RB sure/JJ why/NN ./.
My/NNP guess/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP stems/VBZ from/IN wanting/NN to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN those/DT people/NNS who/WP 've/-NONE- found/VBD a/DT pizza/NN that/WDT blew/JJ them/PRP away/RB ./.
Settebello/NNP did/VBD that/IN for/IN me/PRP ./.

It/PRP feels/VBZ much/RB more/JJR authentic/JJ than/IN the/DT Henderson/NNP location/NN and/CC we/PRP appreciate/VBP how/WRB closer/JJR it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN us/PRP to/TO eat/VB here/RB since/IN we/PRP live/VBP in/IN Las/NNP Vegas/NNP ./.
When/WRB my/JJ girlfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN at/IN about/IN 3:00pm/CD on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD completely/RB empty/JJ so/IN we/PRP got/VBD seated/VBN right/NN away/RB with/IN the/DT

He/PRP is/VBZ always/RB very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC even/RB acknowledged/VBD that/IN I/PRP was/VBD there/RB with/IN my/PRP$ wife

For/IN drinks/NNS ,/, I/PRP originally/RB ordered/VBP their/PRP$ Mirror/NNP Pond/NNP Pale/NNP Ale/NNP on/IN draft/JJ but/CC soon/RB found/VBD out/IN that/IN their/PRP$ tap/NN was/VBD n't/RB working/JJ for/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP was/VBD impressed/VBN that/IN our/PRP$ waitress/NN went/VBD out/IN of/IN her/PRP$ way/NN to/TO ask/VB for/IN a/DT similar/JJ beer/NN ./.
As/IN an/DT appetizer/NN ,/, we/PRP started/VBD off/RP with/IN the/DT Piatto/NNP Misto/NNP which/WDT was/VBD part/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ 5/CD Mini/NNP Bite/NNP Menu/NNP for/IN HH/NNP and/CC consisted/VBD of/IN various/JJ cheeses/NNS and/CC meats/NNS served/VBN with/IN toasted/VBN ,/, warm/NN focaccia/NN bread/NN ./.

Both/DT our/NN pizzas/VBZ came/VBD out/RP in/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ time/NN (/NN ~15/CD minutes/NNS )/JJ and/CC looked/VBD absolutely/RB stunning/JJ ./.
The/DT Margherita/NNP D.O.C/NNP ./.

The/DT crust/NN on/IN my/PRP$ pizza/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ :/: crisp/NN on/IN the/DT edges/NNS while/IN soft/NN but/CC still/RB structured/VBD towards/NNS the/DT center/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ reason/NN I/PRP knocked/VBD off/RP one/CD star/NN was/VBD because/IN of/IN the/DT limited/JJ happy/NN hour/NN menu/NN ,/, but/CC honestly/RB ,/, if/IN I/PRP could/MD rate/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT 4.5/CD ,/, I/PRP totally/RB would/MD ./.

I/PRP do/VBP live/RB right/RB behind/IN the/DT summerlin/NN location/NN so/IN I/PRP thought/VBP ordering/VBG 2/CD pies/NNS to/TO go/VB was/VBD a/DT great/JJ idea/NN ./.
