We/PRP ate/VBP there/RB for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN this/DT weekend-/NN service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, if/IN a/DT little/JJ slower-/NN OK/NNP ,/, they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN staff/NN ./.
Now/RB you/PRP know/VB ./.
Our/NNP server/NN ,/, though/IN ,/, was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC offered/VBD some/DT recommendations/NNS to/TO us/PRP first-timers/NNS ./.
Our/NNP drinks/VBZ were/VBD good/JJ ,/, reasonably/RB priced/VBN at/IN about/IN $/$ 4.25/CD for/IN call/NN mixers/NNS ./.
I/PRP can/MD live/VB with/IN that/DT .../:
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Maffe/NNP with/IN chicken/NN ,/, and/CC while/IN there/EX was/VBD quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN sauce/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT plus/NN ,/, since/IN the/DT rice/NN soaked/VBD up/RP the/DT leftovers/NNS overnight/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD sooo/RB yummy/JJ this/DT morning/NN !/.
The/DT owner/NN did/VBD make/VB the/DT rounds/NNS of/IN the/DT tables/NNS and/CC seemed/VBD to/TO really/RB care/VB what/WP people/NNS thought/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN overall/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD never/RB ever/VB in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN eat/NN here/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD give/VB it/PRP -100/-NONE- stars/VBZ if/IN I/PRP could/MD ./.
Last/JJ time/NN I/PRP was/VBD there/RB for/IN dancing/VBG there/EX was/VBD broken/VBN glass/NN all/NN over/IN which/WDT the/DT staff/NN refused/VBD to/TO clean/JJ up/IN ./.
You/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/VBZ bad/JJ ?/.
There/EX was/VBD also/RB puke/JJ all/DT over/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ entire/NN night/NN that/IN the/DT staff/NN said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB going/VBG to/TO waste/VB their/PRP$ time/NN cleaning/VBG up/RP until/IN bartime/NN ./.
DISGUSTING/NNP ./.
The/DT bathrooms/NNS stank/NN of/IN piss/NN (/IN I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP was/VBD all/DT over/IN the/DT floors/NNS )/RB ,/, the/DT sink/NN lever/NN was/VBD busted/VBN ,/, the/DT towel/NN dispenser/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT ground/NN under/IN the/DT sink/JJ .../NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD even/RB a/DT bloody/NN tampon/NN sitting/VBG on/IN the/DT sink/NN !/VBD !/RB !/VBN !/NN !/NNS !/VBP !/RB !/VBN !/.
I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO report/NN this/DT place/NN to/TO the/DT Health/NNP Department/NNP as/IN soon/RB as/IN I/PRP get/VBP a/DT chance/NN ./.
How/NNP can/MD you/VB even/RB operate/VB a/DT business/NN like/IN this/DT and/CC then/RB refuse/VB to/TO take/VB care/NN of/IN the/DT mess/NN after/IN being/VBG asked/NNS numerous/JJ times/NNS ?/.
How/NNP can/MD you/VB just/RB stand/JJ around/IN when/WRB there/EX are/VBP biohazards/NNS all/DT over/IN your/PRP$ damn/NN restaurant/NN ?/.
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP 've/VBP said/VBN enough/RB .../:
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP like/VBP the/DT variety/NN in/IN flavors/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ a/DT slower/JJR than/IN I/PRP am/VBP accustomed/VBN to/TO but/CC that/IN may/MD simply/RB part/NN of/IN the/DT African/JJ culture/NN (/NN benefit/NN of/IN the/DT doubt/NN )/NN ./.
Just/NNP went/VBD this/DT past/NN weekend/NN ./.
Yum/NNP ./.
My/NNP dad/NNP 's/POS a/DT carnivore/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP vegetarian/JJ -/JJ we/NNS were/VBD both/DT very/NNS pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
First/NNP ,/, my/NNP drink/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP mix/VBP even/RB the/DT virgin/NN stuff/NN ,/, because/IN I/PRP got/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ ,/, FRESH/NNP mango/NNP lemonade/NN ./.
SOOOO/NNP good/NNP ./.
Next/NNP ,/, the/DT appetizers/NNS ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT fried/VBN plantain/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP hot/JJ sauce/NN ,/, so/IN I/PRP was/VBD irritated/VBN at/IN the/DT small/JJ amount/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
Then/RB I/PRP tried/VBP it/PRP ./.
Let/NNP 's/POS just/RB say/VBP a/DT little/JJ goes/NN a/DT LOOOOONG/NNP way/NN ./.
Good/NNP =/VBD ]/IN I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Maffe/NNP -/NNP no/DT meat/NN ,/, nor/CC any/DT mushrooms/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD it/PRP with/IN rice/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT other/JJ reviewer/NN -/NNS a/DT lot/NN of/IN sauce/JJ vs./NN vegetable/JJ ./.
Oh/NNP well/RB ./.
Still/RB fantastic/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB big/JJ on/IN the/DT ``/`` fufu/NN ''/'' ./.
Reminded/JJ me/NN of/IN play-doh/NN ./.
The/DT flan/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
Small/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN ,/, though/IN ./.
My/NNP dad/VBD enjoyed/VBN his/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
He/PRP had/VBD the/DT Nem/NNP (/NNP rolls/NNS ,/, looked/VBD yummy/JJ but/CC had/VBD meat/NN in/IN them/PRP :/: (/JJ )/NNS ,/, Kedjenou/NNP ,/, and/CC couscous/JJ ./.
The/DT couscous/NN was/VBD n't/RB his/PRP$ favorite/JJ ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ just/RB him/PRP ./.
I/PRP tried/VBP it/PRP ,/, the/DT preparation/NN was/VBD spot-on/JJ ,/, just/RB not/RB his/PRP$ thing/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD late/JJ in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP got/VBD there/RB before/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN dinner/NN diners/NNS were/VBD ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, keeping/JJ in/IN mind/NN that/IN the/DT bartender/NN is/VBZ also/RB the/DT server/NN ./.
Unless/IN they/PRP have/VBP more/VBN employees/NNS on/IN busy/NN nights/NNS ,/, I/PRP can/MD see/VB how/WRB service/NN would/MD be/VB a/DT bit/JJ slow/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, very/RB pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
Aside/NN from/IN a/DT few/JJ minor/NN pricing/NN complaints/NNS and/CC such/JJ ,/, we/PRP enjoyed/VBD our/PRP$ dinner/NN and/CC will/MD return/VB ./.
My/NNP biggest/NNP complain/NN was/VBD the/DT service/NN :/: slow/JJ with/IN lots/NNS of/IN mistakes/NNS ./.
It/PRP took/VBD over/IN an/DT hr/NN for/IN our/PRP$ appetizer/NN to/TO arrive/VB ,/, while/IN one/CD party/NN of/IN 3/NNS who/WP came/VBD later/JJ of/IN us/PRP already/RB finished/VBD and/CC left/VBN (/NN and/CC another/DT party/NN of/IN 6/NN had/VBD their/PRP$ order/NN 20min/CD earlier/JJR )/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD too/RB hungry/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP asked/VBD for/IN bread/NN ./.
Took/NNP them/PRP in/IN total/NN 40min/CD to/TO get/VB us/PRP the/DT bread/NN ./.
Water/NNP was/VBD never/RB filled/VBN until/IN we/PRP asked/VBP and/CC it/PRP came/VBD 10min/CD later/NNS ./.
There/EX were/VBD about/RB 5/VBN tables/NNS at/IN the/DT peak/NN time/NN that/WDT night/NN with/IN 2/CD servers/NNS ./.
Then/RB there/RB were/VBD the/DT owner/NN and/CC his/PRP$ family/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN came/VBD to/TO apologize/VB after/IN us/PRP waiting/VBG for/IN almost/RB an/DT hr/NN ,/, saying/VBG he/PRP 'd/VBZ check/NN on/IN the/DT meals/NNS ,/, but/CC he/PRP never/RB came/VBD back/RB with/IN a/DT follow-up/JJ ./.
At/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, he/PRP offered/VBD dessert/NN on/IN the/DT house/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD out/RP of/IN the/DT one/CD we/NN wanted/NN ./.
He/PRP did/VBD n't/RB offer/NN to/TO not/RB charge/VB our/PRP$ appetizer/NN ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ how/WRB sincere/JJ he/PRP was/VBD about/IN his/PRP$ apology/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD ok/JJ ./.
Decor/NNP was/VBD ok./JJ Due/NN to/TO bad/JJ service/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD not/RB go/VB back/RB ./.
Mistakes/NNP they/PRP made/VBD :/: (/JJ 1/CD )/CD 1hr/CD wait/NN entree/NN (/RB 2/CD )/NNS 40min/CD wait/NN for/IN bread/JJ and/CC appetizer/VB (/JJ 3/NNS )/VBP water/NN was/VBD never/RB refilled/VBN (/NN 4/NNS )/VBP entree/NN were/VBD wrong/JJ
We/PRP went/VBD not/RB long/RB after/IN they/PRP opened/VBD ,/, so/RB I/PRP could/MD almost/RB forgive/VB the/DT extremely/JJ slow/NN service/NN and/CC our/PRP$ server/NN 's/POS lack/NN of/IN food-related/JJ English/JJ vocabulary/NN ./.
It/PRP takes/VBZ awhile/JJ to/TO learn/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT food/NN we/PRP (/VBP finally/RB )/JJ got/NN was/VBD inexcusable/JJ ./.
My/NNP dinner/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB chunks/NNS of/IN vegetables/NNS stuck/VBP under/IN a/DT broiler/NN until/IN burned/VBN on/IN the/DT outside/NN ,/, nearly/RB raw/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD African/JJ food/NN would/MD be/VB spicy/NN ,/, but/CC nope/NN ,/, just/RB veggies/NNS ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD got/VBN fish/JJ that/IN was/VBD so/RB full/JJ of/IN bones/NNS it/PRP was/VBD inedible/JJ ./.
Maybe/NNP there/EX were/VBD other/JJ things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN we/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN better/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP could/MD n't/RB communicate/VB with/IN the/DT server/NN well/RB enough/JJ to/TO find/VB out/RP ./.
The/DT glass/NN of/IN wine/NN was/VBD so/RB stingy/JJ ,/, a/DT modest-sized/JJ glass/NN only/RB maybe/VBD a/DT third/JJ of/IN the/DT way/NN full/JJ ,/, that/IN I/PRP sent/VBP it/PRP back/RB and/CC got/VBD a/DT bottled/VBN beer/NN instead/RB ./.
We/PRP recently/RB tried/VBD Africana/NNP on/IN a/DT Tuesday/NNP night/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD packed/VBN with/IN only/RB two/CD servers/NNS hustling/VBG about/IN ./.
Our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD interesting/JJ which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP chose/VBP to/TO check/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
However/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB memorable/JJ and/CC my/JJ dish/NN had/VBD way/VBN too/RB much/JJ oil/NN ./.
The/DT owner/chef/NN came/VBD out/RP and/CC personally/RB asked/VBD us/PRP how/WRB our/JJ meal/NN was/VBD --/: which/WDT is/VBZ always/RB a/DT nice/JJ touch/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT break/NN from/IN the/DT norm/NN and/CC the/DT plantains/NNS were/VBD sooooo/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT first/JJ reviewer/NN on/IN all/DT counts/NNS ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN needs/VBZ to/TO mature/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN took/VBD forever/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ indeed/VBN much/JJ too/NN saturated/VBN with/IN oil/NN and/CC sauce/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT flavors/NNS are/VBP rich/NN and/CC new/JJ to/TO us/PRP ./.
For/IN us/PRP as/RB well/RB ,/, the/DT owner/NN visited/VBD our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB this/DT restaurant/NN offer/NN smaller/JJR tapas/NNS like/IN dishes/NNS for/IN $/$ 5-8/CD at/IN dinner/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP these/DT would/MD be/VB more/RBR popular/JJ with/IN the/DT target/NN audience/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/JJ how/WRB dishes/NNS are/VBP prepared/VBN in/IN Africa/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO believe/NN that/IN this/DT much/JJ sauce/NN is/VBZ the/DT default/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP afternoon/NN and/CC sat/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
The/DT bartender/NN seemed/VBD a/DT little/JJ overwhelmed/VBN and/CC it/PRP took/VBD me/PRP a/DT little/JJ while/NN to/TO get/VB his/PRP$ attention/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ weird/NN ./.
Mirrors/NNS on/IN all/PDT the/DT walls/NNS which/WDT I/PRP hate/VBP when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP eating/VBG ,/, but/CC other/JJ than/IN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ ./.
Big/NNP TVs/NNP tuned/VBD to/TO soccer/NN so/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ place/NN for/IN that/DT if/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT fan/JJ ./.
The/DT jollof/NN rice/NN with/IN chicken/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT sauce/NN had/VBD just/RB a/DT hint/NN of/IN spice/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB savory/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB a/DT while/NN ago/NN and/CC was/VBD not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
As/IN many/JJ have/NN mentioned/VBN ,/, service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ and/CC inattentive/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD was/VBD just/RB not/RB flavorful/JJ and/CC not/RB memorable/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP admit/JJ --/: I/PRP went/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ webpage/NN ,/, and/CC perhaps/RB they/PRP have/VBP improved/VBN a/DT bit/NN ./.
They/PRP now/RB advertise/VBP stuff/JJ like/IN free/JJ wifi/NN and/CC they/PRP also/RB now/RB have/VB a/DT lunch/NN buffet/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD interest/VB me/PRP more/JJR to/TO see/VB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB the/DT dishes/NNS that/IN we/PRP had/VBD that/IN I/PRP disliked/VBD ./.
