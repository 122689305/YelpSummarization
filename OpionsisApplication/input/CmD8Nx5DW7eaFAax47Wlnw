Started/NNP out/NNP strong/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN slowly/RB fizzled/VBD ./.
Or/IN should/MD I/PRP say/VBP the/DT service/NN just/RB disappeared/VBD ./.
For/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD not/RB a/DT single/JJ employee/NN visible/NN in/IN the/DT dining/NN room/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT tables/NNS were/VBD clearly/RB waiting/VBG for/IN food/NN ,/, service/NN or/CC the/DT bill/NN ./.
How/NNP long/RB can/MD it/PRP possibly/RB take/VBP to/TO bring/VB out/RP 4/JJ sundaes/NNS ?/.
Apparently/RB a/DT very/RB very/JJ long/JJ time/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP undecided/JJ if/IN the/DT deal/NN is/VBZ worth/IN the/DT time/NN wasted/VBD ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT sundaes/NNS turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB 4/VBN bowls/NNS of/IN ice/JJ cream/NN ./.
Tonight/NNP I/PRP went/VBD out/IN for/IN dinner/NN with/IN mum/NN and/CC dad/RB ./.
Now/RB i/JJ 've/NN been/VBN in/IN Australia/NNP for/IN 2/CD years/NNS prior/RB to/TO arriving/VBG back/RB and/CC I/PRP was/VBD shocked/VBN at/IN the/DT service/NN we/PRP received/VBD ./.
I/PRP just/RB remember/VBP this/DT place/NN being/VBG filled/VBN with/IN better/JJR staff/NN ./.
As/IN soon/RB as/IN we/PRP sat/VBP down/IN we/PRP decided/VBD on/IN what/WP we/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO get/VB ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT spinach/JJ dip/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT festive/JJ special/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT quarter/NN chicken/NN dinner/NN with/IN stuffing/JJ and/CC cranberry/JJ sauce/NN ./.
My/NNP parents/VBD both/DT ordered/NNS a/DT double/JJ leg../NN
While/IN the/DT guy/NN was/VBD taking/VBG out/RP order/IN he/PRP tried/VBD to/TO push/VB the/DT white/JJ meat/NN on/IN both/DT me/NNS and/CC my/NNS parents../NN
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB so/RB I/PRP agreed/VBD ./.
After/IN my/PRP$ parents/NN completed/VBD their/PRP$ order/NN he/PRP went/VBD away/RB and/CC brought/RB us/VB the/DT drinks/NNS ./.
Shortly/RB after/IN he/PRP brought/VBD us/PRP the/DT appetiser/NN he/PRP then/RB told/VBD my/NNS parents/IN they/PRP could/MD n't/RB get/VB the/DT double/JJ leg/NN because/IN there/NN was/VBD n't/RB enough/RB as/IN all/DT and/CC let/VB me/PRP quote/VB ``/`` asian/JJ people/NNS ordered/IN it/PRP ''/'' I/PRP was/VBD appalled/JJ at/IN his/PRP$ statement/NN ./.
My/NNP dad/VBD agreed/CD to/TO accept/VB the/DT half/NN chicken/NN and/CC I/PRP firmly/RB stated/VBD that/IN mum/NN does/VBZ n't/RB not/RB eat/VB white/JJ meat/NN so/IN she/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO have/VB what/WP she/PRP ordered/VBD which/WDT was/VBD the/DT double/JJ leg/NN dinner/NN ./.
When/WRB My/NNP meal/NN came/VBD out/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB the/DT quarter/NN chicken/NN dinner/NN with/IN no/DT festive/JJ extras../NN before/IN I/PRP could/MD let/VB him/PRP know/VB he/PRP took/VBD off/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO try/NNS and/CC get/VB his/PRP$ attention/NN ./.
He/PRP then/RB brought/VBD it/PRP out/RP on/IN a/DT separate/JJ plate/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD over/IN cooked/JJ and/CC so/RB was/VBD the/DT chicken/NN ./.
It/PRP did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB fresh/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT server/NN we/PRP received/VBD tonight/NN had/VBD no/DT customer/NN service/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
This/DT was/VBD a/DT place/NN I/PRP remember/VBP going/VBG to/TO when/WRB I/PRP lived/VBD here/RB and/CC today/NN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB the/DT same/JJ ./.
Also/RB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN the/DT food/NN chain/NN stopped/VBD giving/VBG the/DT washing/NN dishes/VBZ at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN but/CC we/PRP also/RB did/VBD n't/RB receive/VB that/DT either/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all../NN extremely/RB disappointed/JJ
Service/NN :/: Fast/NNP and/CC friendly/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP tell/VBP them/PRP your/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ too/RB dry/JJ they/PRP will/MD happily/RB bring/VB out/RP a/DT new/JJ fresh/JJ one/NN for/IN you/PRP ./.
Food/NNP :/: 8/CD out/IN of/IN 10/CD times/NNS it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB fresh/JJ and/CC the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ n't/RB too/RB dry/JJ ./.
Ambience/NN :/: Typical/JJ ,/, but/CC more/JJR quiet/JJ compared/VBN to/TO other/JJ locations/NNS ./.
Cleanliness/NN :/: This/DT location/NN is/VBZ fairly/RB new/JJ and/CC very/RB clean/JJ ./.
Their/NNP sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/VBZ +/JJ whatever/NN dipping/VBG sauce/NN it/PRP is/VBZ they/PRP give/VBP is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
Every/NNP time/NN we/PRP come/VBP we/PRP always/RB upgrade/JJ our/NN side/NN to/TO sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.
Their/JJ quarter/NN chicken/NN and/CC chalet/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB typical/JJ ,/, nothing/NN different/NN from/IN other/JJ Swiss/JJ Chalet/NNP locations/NNS ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ meal/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ price/NN ./.
I/PRP actually/RB visited/VBD this/DT location/NN when/WRB they/PRP first/RB opened/VBD and/CC man/NN did/VBD it/PRP suck/VB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ parents/NN on/IN a/DT weekday/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD not/RB greeted/VBN for/IN more/JJR than/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS ./.
We/PRP stood/VBD at/IN the/DT door/NN waiting/VBG for/IN someone/NN to/TO seat/NN us/PRP but/CC there/EX was/VBD nobody/JJ there/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN probably/RB had/VBD 9/VBN tables/NNS at/IN most/JJS ./.
The/DT supervisor/NN on/IN duty/NN was/VBD sitting/VBG around/IN just/RB hanging/VBG out/RP on/IN the/DT seats/NNS with/IN people/NNS and/CC on/IN his/PRP$ cellphone/NN ./.
He/PRP eventually/VBD saw/JJ us/NN and/CC sat/JJ us/NN down/IN at/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
The/DT interaction/NN between/IN him/PRP and/CC us/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC nothing/JJ out/NN of/IN the/DT standard/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP our/JJ food/NN and/CC when/WRB it/PRP got/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ it/PRP looked/VBD really/RB bland/JJ ./.
My/NNP half/VBD rack/NN of/IN ribs/NNS were/VBD actually/RB 2/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN 1/3/CD pieced/JJ together/NN ./.
Wtf/NNP ?/.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB end/VB up/RP finishing/JJ my/NN food/NN because/IN it/PRP honestly/RB tasted/VBN disgusting/NN ./.
Probably/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/NN experienced/VBD I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN with/IN Swiss/JJ Chalet/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD never/RB consider/VB going/VBG back/RB to/TO this/DT location/NN even/RB though/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT closest/NN to/TO my/PRP$ house/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB a/DT host/hostess/NN here/RB ,/, and/CC no/DT one/CD attends/NNS to/TO the/DT front/NN door/NN ./.
Be/NNP prepared/VBD to/TO stand/NNP there/NNP waiting/NN for/IN a/DT good/JJ 5-10/CD minutes/NNS before/IN anyone/NN comes/NN to/TO greet/NN you/PRP ./.
The/DT table/JJ we/NNS were/VBD sat/JJ at/IN ,/, had/VBD crumbs/NNS all/DT over/IN it/PRP ./.
She/PRP just/RB say/VBP us/PRP down/RB and/CC left/RB without/IN saying/VBG anything/NN ./.
She/PRP came/VBD back/RB pretty/RB quickly/RB to/TO ask/VB us/PRP for/IN or/CC our/PRP$ drink/NN order/NN ,/, I/PRP got/VBD an/DT Orange/NNP Crush/NNP ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN ordered/VBD an/DT Iced/VBN Tea/NN ./.
The/DT drinks/VBZ came/VBD really/RB quickly/RB ./.
Both/DT our/NN drinks/VBZ tasted/VBN very/RB watered/JJ down/IN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD quick/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ refills/NNS too/RB ,/, and/CC had/VBD brought/VBN us/PRP fresh/JJ drinks/NNS before/IN we/PRP finished/VBP our/VBN round/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT double/JJ leg/NN dinner/NN with/IN corn/NN as/IN my/PRP$ side/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT 1/3/CD rack/NN with/IN wings/NNS and/CC fries/NNS as/IN his/PRP$ side/NN ./.
10/CD minutes/NNS into/IN ordering/JJ ,/, she/PRP comes/VBZ back/RB and/CC tells/NNS me/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB 2/VBN pieces/NNS of/IN dark/JJ meat/NN ,/, and/CC asked/VBD if/IN I/PRP wanted/VBP to/TO switch/JJ one/CD to/TO a/DT chicken/NN breast/NN ./.
I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB like/VB chicken/VBN breast/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP told/VBD her/PRP no/DT ./.
Then/RB she/PRP says/VBZ ,/, well/RB you/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO wait/VB 45/JJ minutes/NNS for/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN then/RB ./.
So/IN she/PRP pretty/RB much/JJ forced/NN me/NN to/TO choose/VB the/DT chicken/NN breast/NN ,/, not/RB cool/NN ./.
When/WRB our/JJ food/NN finally/RB arrives/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ meal/NN came/VBD with/IN fries/NNS ,/, so/RB did/VBD my/PRP$ friends/NNS ./.
I/PRP immediately/RB told/VBD her/PRP ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBP corn/NN ./.
She/PRP just/RB apologized/VBD and/CC told/VBD me/PRP she/PRP 'll/MD go/VB and/CC bring/VB the/DT corn/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD another/DT 10/CD minutes/NNS before/IN the/DT corn/NN arrived/VBD ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP how/WRB long/JJ does/VBZ it/PRP take/VB to/TO heat/VB up/RP frozen/NN or/CC canned/VBN corn/NN ?/.
My/NNP friend/NN did/VBD n't/RB like/IN his/PRP$ wings/NNS ,/, said/VBD they/PRP barely/RB had/VBD any/DT sauce/NN on/IN them/PRP ./.
And/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN ever/NN dining/VBG at/IN Swiss/JJ Chalet/NNP and/CC not/RB getting/VB a/DT finger/JJR bowl/NN ./.
Not/RB like/IN the/DT finger/JJR bowl/NN makes/VBZ much/RB of/IN a/DT difference/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ really/RB what/WP sets/NNS Swiss/JJ Chalet/NNP apart/NN from/IN other/JJ restaurants/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP even/RB denied/VBD me/PRP that/IN one/CD bit/NN of/IN nostalgia/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB having/VBG a/DT very/RB bad/JJ day/NN ,/, she/PRP even/RB dropped/VBD cutlery/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN when/WRB bussing/NN another/DT tables/NNS empty/NN plates/NNS ./.
Our/NNP dining/NN experience/NN was/VBD completely/RB horrible/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ she/PRP was/VBD having/VBG a/DT worse/JJ day/NN ./.
We/PRP will/MD go/VB back/RB and/CC let/VB her/PRP redeem/VB herself/NN ,/, and/CC hopefully/RB update/JJ this/DT review/NN to/TO a/DT better/NN rating/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBD delivery/NN from/IN this/DT location/NN recently/RB and/CC dined/VBD in/RP at/IN the/DT Highway/NNP 7/NNP location/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP believe/VBP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ improvement/NN in/IN their/PRP$ rotisserie/NN chicken/NN ./.
Compared/NNP to/TO last/JJ year/NN ,/, the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/JJ dry/NN and/CC hard/JJ to/TO eat/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD tender/RB ,/, very/RB moist/JJ ,/, and/CC just/RB tasted/VBN good/JJ in/IN general/JJ ./.
Our/NNP family/NN has/VBZ been/VBN coming/VBG to/TO this/DT location/NN for/IN the/DT past/JJ 2/CD years/NNS ./.
We/PRP always/RB have/VBP an/DT amazing/JJ experience/NN at/IN this/DT location/NN ./.
Great/NNP food/NN ,/, great/JJ staff/NN who/WP are/VBP always/RB attentive/JJ ./.
Highly/RB recommend/VBP for/IN the/DT right/JJ price/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT Harvey/NNP 's/POS also/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ location../NN We/PRP go/VBP there/RB when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP in/IN a/DT hurry/NN for/IN a/DT great/JJ tasting/VBG burger/NN ./.
I/PRP always/VBP like/IN coming/VBG to/TO this/DT place/NN because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ close/JJ to/TO home/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB as/IN packed/JJ ./.
However/RB the/DT only/JJ thing/NN packed/VBD is/VBZ the/DT parking/NN lot/NN since/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN a/DT plaza/NN filled/VBN with/IN other/JJ restaurants/NNS ,/, grocery/NN store/NN ,/, etc/NN ./.
Coming/VBG here/RB on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP Afternoon/NNP after/IN taking/NNP an/DT early/JJ trip/NN up/IN to/TO Midland/NNP ,/, Swiss/JJ Chalet/NNP was/VBD the/DT perfect/JJ choice/NN on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP ./.
This/DT location/NN is/VBZ conveniently/RB close/JJ to/TO home/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ plenty/NN of/IN seating/NN ./.
For/IN drinks/VBZ I/PRP had/VBD their/PRP$ Austriailian/JJ Merlot/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ Gramps/NNP had/VBD their/VBN pint/NN of/IN beer/NN ./.
For/IN apps/NNS ,/, we/PRP shared/VBD their/PRP$ spinach/NN cheese/NN dip/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, about/IN a/DT 3.5/5/CD ,/, but/CC nothing/NN compares/VBZ to/TO Marlowes/NNP ,/, or/CC Baton/NNP Rouge/NNP 's/POS spinach/JJ dip../NN For/IN the/DT mains/NNS ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBP their/PRP$ two/CD piece/NN chicken/NN thigh/JJ dinner/NN with/IN fries/NNS ./.
One/CD thing/NN about/IN Swiss/JJ Chalet/NNP ,/, their/PRP$ fries/NNS are/VBP always/RB delish/JJ and/CC not/RB over/IN salted/JJ nor/NN oily/RB like/IN many/JJ fast/NN food/NN chains/VBZ out/IN there/RB ./.
This/DT dish/NN was/VBD an/DT overall/JJ 4/5/CD Portions/NNS were/VBD sufficient/JJ ,/, and/CC presentation/NN was/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ standards/NN .../: but/CC nothing/NN to/TO be/VB head-over-heels/NNS about/IN ./.
Great/NNP place/NNP ,/, and/CC always/RB a/DT neighborhood/NN fav/NN !/.
I/PRP have/VBP ordered/VBN the/DT quarter/NN chicken/NN dinner/NN with/IN Caesar/NNP salad/RB ,/, the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN perfect/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT Caesar/NNP salad/NN was/VBD so/RB little/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ even/RB though/IN there/EX was/VBD dressing/VBG ,/, but/CC taste/NN like/IN water/NN ./.
The/DT waiter/NN did/VBD n't/RB ask/VB if/IN everything/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ,/, I/PRP guessed/VBD he/PRP was/VBD way/VBN too/RB busy/JJ ,/, I/PRP can/MD tell/VB this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ way/NN under/IN staff/NN
The/DT manager/NN needs/VBZ a/DT full/JJ customer/NN service/NN class/NN again/RB ./.
He/PRP did/VBD not/RB show/VB interest/NN in/IN the/DT new/JJ customers/NNS ./.
The/DT table/JJ and/CC chairs/NNS where/WRB I/PRP sat/VBP were/VBD greasy/JJ ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT manager/NN if/IN I/PRP could/MD change/VB the/DT chair/NN he/PRP said/VBD ``/`` sure/JJ yes/NNS ,/, do/VBP whatever/JJR you/PRP feel/VBP like/IN ./. ''/''
I/PRP told/VBD him/PRP the/DT chair/NN has/VBZ greasy/VBN on/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP left/VBP it/PRP on/IN the/DT side/NN for/IN him/PRP to/TO clean/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC he/PRP pushed/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT table/JJ behind/NN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP quarter/JJ chicken/NN ,/, half/DT baby/NN back/RB ribs/VBZ ./.
My/NNP food/NN was/VBD cold/JJ and/CC hard/JJ ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB finish/VB our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN did/VBD n't/RB even/RB ask/VB if/IN there/EX was/VBD something/NN wrong/NN with/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
I/PRP used/VBD to/TO work/NN as/IN waitress/NN if/IN my/PRP$ customers/NNS had/VBD lots/NNS of/IN leftover/NN but/CC did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO take/VB home/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB for/IN feedbacks/NNS ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP they/PRP 're/VBP used/VBN to/TO this/DT so/NN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB care/VB ./.
The/DT waitress/NN cleaned/VBD my/PRP$ table/JJ ,/, she/PRP picked/VBD up/RP my/PRP$ plate/NN and/CC saw/VBD a/DT piece/NN of/IN bone/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB know/VB I/PRP drop/VBP the/DT bone/NN under/IN the/DT napkin/NN ./.
She/PRP said/VBD ``/`` bone/NN ''/'' and/CC looked/VBD at/IN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP looked/VBD at/IN her/PRP and/CC she/PRP stared/VBD at/IN me/PRP for/IN awhile/NN and/CC said/VBD ``/`` bone/NN ''/'' again/NN ./.
She/PRP asked/VBD me/PRP to/TO pick/VB up/RP the/DT bone/NN for/IN her/PRP ./.
I/PRP used/VBD the/DT napkin/NN to/TO pick/VB up/RP and/CC put/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT plate/NN for/IN her/PRP because/IN I/PRP thought/VBP she/PRP could/MD n't/RB reach/VB ./.
After/IN that/DT I/PRP realized/VBD she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO clean/NN that/IN up/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD so/RB shocked/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB drop/VB the/DT bone/NN on/IN purpose/NN ,/, but/CC your/PRP$ part/NN of/IN customer/NN services/NNS is/VBZ to/TO clean/JJ the/DT table/JJ ./.
You/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ask/VB the/DT customer/NN to/TO pick/VB up/RP garbage/NN for/IN you/PRP ./.
During/VBG my/JJ 2/CD years/NNS of/IN working/NN as/IN a/DT waitress/NN ,/, regardless/JJ how/WRB messy/JJ my/NN customers/NNS were/VBD ,/, I/PRP cleaned/VBD up/RP everything/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ how/WRB you/PRP earn/VBP good/JJ tips/NNS ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ time/NN eating/VBG there/NN and/CC my/NN last/JJ time/NN ./.
Just/NNP had/VBD a/DT horrible/JJ lunch/NN at/IN this/DT location/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO give/VB this/DT location/NN a/DT 3.5/CD stars/NNS ./.
Place/NNP is/VBZ clean/JJ ,/, staff/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB ,/, the/DT young/JJ manager/NN walks/VBZ around/IN and/CC asks/VBZ if/IN everything/NN is/VBZ ok/JJ with/IN customers/NNS meals/NNS (/VBP which/WDT is/VBZ nice/JJ )/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, portions/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ./.

The/DT only/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ .../: sometimes/RB the/DT staff/NN disappears/NNS for/IN awhile/NN ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ ,/, if/IN its/PRP$ break/JJ time/NN or/CC if/IN they/PRP are/VBP understaff/JJ and/CC they/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT back/RB catching/VBG up/RP on/IN other/JJ duties/NNS ./.
