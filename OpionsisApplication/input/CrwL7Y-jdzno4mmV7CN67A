This/DT place/NN is/VBZ horrible/JJ ./.
When/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD up/RP to/TO the/DT doors/NNS the/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP see/VBP was/VBD a/DT used/JJ needle/NN with/IN no/DT cap/NN laying/VBG right/NN in/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN the/DT entrance/NN ./.
As/IN if/IN that/DT was/VBD not/RB alarming/VBG enough/RB ,/, the/DT person/NN that/IN greeted/VBN my/NN husband/NN and/CC I/PRP told/VBD us/PRP that/IN he/PRP could/MD not/RB use/VB the/DT restroom/NN because/IN we/PRP were/VBD only/RB having/JJ drinks/NNS and/CC not/RB dining/VBG ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD to/TO speak/NN to/TO a/DT manager/NN and/CC were/VBD denied/VBN ./.
I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP skipping/VBG this/DT experience/NN and/CC going/VBG any/DT where/NN else/RB but/CC here/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO find/VB authentic/JJ Mexican/JJ food/NN in/IN downtown/NN Phoenix/NNP (/NNP surprisingly/RB )/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT spot/NN ./.

Ordered/IN the/DT 5/NN street/NN tacos/NNS :/: one/CD chicken/NN ,/, one/CD pork/NN and/CC 3/NN carne/NN asana/NN ./.
Like/IN others/NNS stated/VBD it/PRP was/VBD lacking/VBG in/IN the/DT flavor/NN department/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD beyond/IN spicy/NN though/IN so/RB I/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB get/VB a/DT feel/NN for/IN the/DT actual/JJ flavor/NN because/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO hurry/JJ up/NN and/CC take/VB a/DT swig/NN of/IN some/DT tea/NN ./.
Chips/NNP also/RB tasted/VBD old/JJ .../: Salsa/NNP was/VBD very/RB watery/JJ ./.
Would/NNP have/VBP been/VBN nice/JJ to/TO have/VB some/DT fresh/JJ hot/NN chips/NNS and/CC some/DT chunkier/NN salsa/NN ./.
The/DT carne/NN asada/NN had/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN gristle/NN which/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB disappointing/JJ ./.

The/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ disheveled/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT good/JJ review/NN because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ stars/NNS built/VBD up/RB ./.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB maybe/NN I/PRP ordered/VBD the/DT wrong/JJ thing/NN but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB really/RB making/VB a/DT good/JJ excuse/NN ./.
Everything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN should/MD be/VB good/JJ and/CC tasty/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT traditional/JJ breakfast/NN dish/NN of/IN Chilaquiles/NNP ,/, served/VBN with/IN scrambled/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN black/NN beans/NNS ./.
Let/NNP me/VBD just/RB start/VBN by/IN saying/VBG that/IN none/NN of/IN these/DT three/CD items/NNS were/VBD all/DT that/DT great/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT eggs/NNS were/VBD overcooked/VBN and/CC dry/JJ ,/, the/DT beans/NNS were/VBD tasteless/JJ and/CC look/JJ like/IN they/PRP had/VBD microwaved/VBN and/CC been/VBN overheated/VBN as/IN most/JJS of/IN them/PRP had/VBD skins/NNS that/IN were/VBD coming/VBG off/RP ,/, (/JJ as/IN if/IN left/NNS in/IN the/DT microwave/NN too/RB long/RB ?/. )/.

I/PRP left/VBD with/IN a/DT terrible/JJ case/NN of/IN heartburn/JJ it/PRP was/VBD just/RB too/RB much/JJ chili/NN ./.
At/IN $/$ 7.60/CD for/IN this/DT I/NN thought/VBD the/DT pricing/NN was/VBD reasonable/JJ ,/, however/RB not/RB for/IN this/DT the/DT way/NN it/PRP was/VBD prepared/VBN ./.
The/DT chips/NNS they/PRP dye/VBP them/PRP Green/NNP and/CC red/VBD ./.
They/PRP were/VBD just/RB OK/RB ,/, nothing/NN special/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT cups/NNS that/IN they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP and/CC are/VBP very/RB tiny/JJ and/CC you/PRP have/VBP to/TO keep/VB asking/NN for/IN refills/NNS ./.
They/PRP serve/VBP a/DT tiny/NN teeny/NN cup/NN of/IN guacamole/NN with/IN the/DT chips/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD OK/NNP but/CC if/IN you/PRP wanted/VBP more/JJR it/PRP 's/VBZ three/CD dollars/NNS extra/JJ ./.
One/CD other/JJ annoying/JJ factor/NN was/VBD the/DT waiter/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT phone/NN when/WRB I/PRP arrived/VBD ,/, he/PRP also/RB has/VBZ like/IN an/DT iPad/JJ going/NN or/CC some/DT kind/NN of/IN other/JJ tablet/NN ./.
