The/DT food/NN was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD terribly/RB slow/JJ ./.

Many/JJ other/JJ better/NN breakfast/NN places/NNS given/VBP the/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
service/NN is/VBZ nice/RB ,/, food/NN is/VBZ quick/RB ./.
food/NN is/VBZ super/NN bland/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD n't/RB recommend/VB this/DT place/NN to/TO anyone/VB nor/CC coming/VBG back/RB ./.
A/DT friend/NN recommended/VBD this/DT all/DT day/NN breakfast/VBD place/NN recently/RB so/IN I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO come/VB in/IN for/IN breakfast/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ !/NN !/.
The/DT waitress/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG all/DT throughout/NN and/CC gave/VBD us/PRP space/NN when/WRB we/PRP needed/VBP it/PRP ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD quick/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN as/IN great/JJ ./.
As/IN a/DT brief/JJ overview/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ what/WP was/VBD ordered/VBN :/: breakfast/JJ burrito/NN ,/, omelet/NN ,/, and/CC regular/JJ eggs/NNS with/IN turkey/NN bacon/NN ./.
All/DT orders/NNS came/VBD with/IN home/NN fries/NNS (/VBP which/WDT are/VBP so/RB so/RB good/JJ )/NN ,/, some/DT fruit/NN (/VBD a/DT slice/NN of/IN orange/NN ,/, cantaloupe/NN ,/, and/CC pineapple/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN toast/NN cut/NN in/IN half/NN and/CC buttered/VBD (/RP excluding/VBG the/DT breakfast/NN burrito/NN plate/NN !/NN )/NN ./.
Each/DT table/JJ also/RB has/VBZ your/VBN sugar/NN ,/, sweetener/NN ,/, and/CC spreads/NNS ,/, including/VBG jam/NN and/CC peanut/NN butter/NN ./.

So/RB good/JJ though/IN lol/NN The/DT only/JJ thing/NN about/IN my/CD plate/NN (/NN three/CD eggs/NNS ,/, any/DT style/NN ,/, with/IN turkey/NN bacon/NN )/NN is/VBZ that/IN my/PRP$ scrambled/JJ eggs/NNS did/VBD n't/RB really/RB look/VB like/IN three/CD eggs/NNS at/IN all/DT ./.
But/CC that/DT was/VBD a/DT blessing/NN in/IN disguise/NN cause/NN I/PRP was/VBD way/JJ too/RB full/JJ !/.

Came/NN here/RB for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC well/RB priced/VBD compared/VBN to/TO other/JJ places/NNS ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN why/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP giving/VBG them/PRP a/DT 4/NN is/VBZ because/IN of/IN the/DT wait/JJ time/NN to/TO be/VB seated/VBN ./.
Once/IN we/PRP sat/VBP down/IN the/DT service/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC fast/NN ./.

She/PRP only/RB gave/VBD us/PRP one/CD set/NN of/IN cutlery/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB a/DT big/JJ deal/NN ./.
Orange/NNP juice/NN was/VBD outrageously/RB expensive/JJ for/IN Minute/NNP Maid/NNP orange/NNP juice/NN ./.
$/$ 3.50/CD for/IN a/DT bottle/NN of/IN orange/JJ juice/NN .../: Giggling/NNP tomatoes/NNS charges/VBP that/IN for/IN freshly/RB squeezed/VBN orange/NN juice/NN pressed/VBD right/RB in/IN front/NN of/IN you/PRP so/RB personally/RB I/PRP would/MD n't/RB order/VB orange/JJ juice/NN again/RB ./.

BUT/NNP .../: if/IN you/PRP ask/VBP for/IN tomatoes/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN INSTEAD/NN of/IN home/NN fries/NNS and/CC toast/NN ,/, they/PRP still/RB want/VBP to/TO charge/VB you/PRP 2/VB dollars/NNS ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT principal/NN here/RB and/CC I/PRP will/MD never/RB visit/VB this/DT establishment/NN again/RB ./.

As/IN mentioned/VBN in/IN other/JJ reviews/NNS ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT modern/JJ looking/NN restaurant/NN in/IN a/DT suburban/JJ strip/NN plaza/NN ,/, and/CC seems/VBZ slightly/RB out-of-place/JJ in/IN Mississauga/NNP ./.
Well/NNP this/DT definitely/RB the/DT good/JJ out-of-place/NN ./.
I/PRP visited/VBD Panagio/NNP 's/POS during/JJ brunchtime/NN on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP ./.
They/PRP were/VBD quite/JJ busy/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT table/JJ for/IN 2/CD fairly/NN quickly/RB ./.
For/IN my/PRP$ order/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD the/DT ``/`` Huevos/NNP of/IN the/DT Ranch/NNP ''/'' -/JJ their/PRP$ take/NN on/IN the/DT huevos/NNS rancheros/NNS ./.

I/PRP really/VBP liked/VBN how/WRB all/PDT the/DT flavours/NNS mixed/VBN together/NN and/CC having/VBG salsa/NN ,/, tortillas/NNS ,/, and/CC guac/JJ during/IN breakfast/NN was/VBD a/DT totally/RB new/JJ experience/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT feta/NN cheese/NN was/VBD my/VBN favourite/JJ part/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP tasted/VBD firm/NN and/CC fresh/NN ./.

Ordered/NNP normal/VBD breakfasts/NNS with/IN eggs/NNS ,/, bacon/NN ,/, sausages/NNS ./.
My/NNP family/NN had/VBD waffles/NNS and/CC omelette/JJ too/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD okay/JJ but/CC the/DT experience/NN was/VBD marred/VBN because/IN of/IN the/DT initial/JJ long/JJ wait/NN to/TO get/VB seated/VBN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB really/RB the/DT restaurant/NN 's/POS fault/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP so/RB popular/JJ ./.
Having/NNP said/VBD that/IN ,/, I/PRP suppose/VBP if/IN I/PRP were/VBD to/TO go/VB back/RB ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD have/VB to/TO schedule/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT summer/NN when/WRB I/PRP can/MD wake/VB up/RP earlier/JJR and/CC have/VBP proper/NN breakfast/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD DELICIOUS/NNP ./.
Being/VBG from/IN Montreal/NNP ,/, the/DT smoked/JJ meat/NN in/IN the/DT eggs/NNS benny/NN was/VBD just/RB such/JJ a/DT great/JJ pairing/NN ./.

Came/NN here/RB as/IN a/DT party/NN of/IN two/CD at/IN 1pm/CD on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP ./.
First/NNP thoughts/NNS were/VBD this/DT place/NN is/VBZ busier/JJR than/IN expected/VBN (/NN no/DT line/NN ,/, but/CC no/DT free/JJ tables/NNS either/VBP )/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT cool/NN contemporary/JJ layout/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP Oreo/NNP pancakes/NNS ,/, Greek/NNP omelette/NNP ,/, side/NN of/IN French/NNP toast/NN ,/, and/CC OJ/NNP ./.

The/DT menu/NN did/VBD n't/RB say/VB freshly/RB squeezed/VBN so/RB guess/VBZ that/DT 's/VBZ fine/NN Service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ -/JJ seemed/NN to/TO be/VB understaffed/JJ ./.

The/DT food/NN good/NN was/VBD as/IN usual/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD meh/JJ today/NN !/.

I/PRP like/VBP the/DT open/JJ kitchen/NN that/WDT was/VBD in/IN front/NN of/IN me/NN since/IN we/PRP sat/VBP at/IN the/DT high/JJ table/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ and/CC fast/NN ./.

There/EX was/VBD two/CD tv/JJ mounted/VBN on/IN the/DT walls/ceilings/NNS so/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB the/DT news/NN which/WDT is/VBZ nice/RB ./.
My/NNP soup/NN was/VBD hot/NN which/WDT is/VBZ great/JJ ./.

It/PRP came/VBD with/IN buttered/JJ toast/NN which/WDT if/IN I/PRP knew/VBP ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB want/VB butter/NN on/IN them/PRP ./.
The/DT home/NN fries/VBZ was/VBD crispy/NN and/CC the/DT right/NN size/NN ./.

My/NNP one/CD criticism/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB take/VB reservations/NNS ,/, so/RB lines/RB can/MD go/VB out/IN the/DT door/NN at/IN peak/NN times/NNS on/IN weekends/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP can/MD be/VB difficult/JJ if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO secure/VB a/DT table/JJ for/IN larger/JJR groups/NNS ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP always/RB considered/VBN french/NN toast/NN a/DT fullproof/NN meal/NN but/CC I/PRP was/VBD clearly/RB wrong/JJ ./.
My/NNP french/NN toast/NN was/VBD thick/JJ which/WDT I/PRP love/VBP but/CC it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB lightly/RB dipped/VBN in/IN the/DT eggs/NNS bacause/VBP the/DT middle/NN tasted/VBD like/IN regular/JJ toast/NN not/RB like/IN bread/NN that/IN soaked/JJ up/IN the/DT eggs/NNS ,/, milk/NN and/CC cinnamon/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD very/RB disappointed/JJ in/IN the/DT apple/NN cinnamon/NN topping/NN ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB peel/VB the/DT apple/NN before/IN cooking/VBG them/PRP down/RB ./.
Anyone/NNP who/WP bakes/NNS or/CC cooks/NNS would/MD sum/VB that/DT up/NN to/TO laziness/NN ./.
When/WRB you/PRP cook/VBP apples/NNS they/PRP become/VBP melt/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN soft/NN but/CC the/DT skin/NN remains/VBZ chewy/NN ./.
You/PRP would/MD never/RB want/VB the/DT eat/NN an/DT apple/NN pie/NN with/IN those/DT contrasting/VBG textures/NNS ./.
Overall/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN was/VBD meh/JJ but/CC the/DT servers/NNS were/VBD friendly/RB and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD bright/JJ ,/, open/JJ and/CC clean/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ other/JJ items/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN are/VBP much/JJ better/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB liked/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP offer/VBP turkey/JJ bacon/NN and/CC coconut/NN water/NN in/IN the/DT coconut/NN ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB for/IN sure/JJ if/IN I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
My/NNP new/JJ favorite/JJ breakfast/NN spot/NN in/IN North/NNP Mississauga/NNP ./.
Why/WRB ?/.
-/JJ Service/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB and/CC while/IN there/EX are/VBP line-ups/NNS ,/, they/PRP move/VBP quickly/RB -/JJ The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN variety/NN and/CC healthy/JJ choices/NNS (/VBP if/IN you/PRP want/VBP )/RB -/JJ The/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC not/RB just/RB piled/VBN on/IN a/DT plate/NN (/NN nicely/RB arranged/VBD )/NNP -/NNP The/DT Home/NNP Fries/NNP are/VBP really/RB good/JJ !/.
-/JJ They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB put/VB those/DT little/JJ plastic/JJ containers/NNS of/IN jam/NN directly/NNS on/IN the/DT food/NN (/NN hate/NN that/WDT !/-NONE- )/.
-/JJ They/PRP 'll/VBP give/IN you/PRP a/DT booth/NN ,/, even/RB for/IN 2/CD people/NNS ,/, if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ available/JJ (/NN no/NN ,/, ``/`` sorry/JJ ,/, that/DT is/VBZ for/IN 4/JJ people/NNS ''/'' )/IN -/JJ The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ for/IN the/DT service/NN and/CC quality/NN -/JJ The/DT hot/NN chocolate/NN is/VBZ awesome/JJ !/.
-/JJ The/DT hours/NNS are/VBP easy/JJ to/TO remember/NN 7am/CD to/TO 4pm/CD ,/, 7/CD days/NNS a/DT week/NN ./.
Easy/NNP peasy/NN !/.
So/RB refreshing/VBG to/TO see/VB a/DT clean/NN ,/, diner/VB style/JJ environment/NN with/IN friendly/RB staff/NN that/IN is/VBZ n't/RB as/IN ``/`` country/NN ''/'' as/IN Cora/NNP 's/POS or/CC as/RB plain/NN as/IN Sunset/NNP Grill/NNP ./.
You/PRP 'll/MD pay/VB a/DT couple/NN of/IN dollars/NNS more/JJR than/IN those/DT other/JJ breakfast/NN spots/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP ./.
And/CC if/IN you/PRP do/VBP luck/JJ out/NN for/IN a/DT booth/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB very/RB comfortable/JJ ./.
Finally/RB ,/, go/RB when/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB busy/JJ if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP trying/VBG it/PRP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
Then/RB you/PRP 'll/MD know/VB that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/VBG the/DT wait/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ busy/NN ./.
Very/NNP friendly/RB staff/VBD which/WDT makes/VBZ the/DT place/NN feel/NN like/IN such/JJ a/DT cozy/NN place/NN to/TO grab/NN breakfast/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP their/PRP$ chocolate/NN chip/NN pancakes/NNS !/.
Your/PRP$ typical/JJ breakfast/lunch/NN diner/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT step/NN up/IN from/IN Denny/NNP 's/POS ,/, but/CC nothing/NN special/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP n't/RB many/JJ good/JJ breakfast/NN places/NNS around/IN this/DT area/NN ./.
As/IN soon/RB as/IN we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN ,/, we/PRP knew/VBD that/IN its/PRP$ going/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT long/JJ wait/NN as/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT line/NN up/IN but/CC it/PRP moved/VBD quite/JJ fast/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, taste/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC the/DT portions/NNS are/VBP healthy/JJ and/CC tummy/JJ filling/NN ./.
Their/NNP menu/NN is/VBZ decent/JJ and/CC attractive/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP their/PRP$ 3/NN egg/NN breakfast/NN which/WDT comes/-NONE- with/IN toast/NN and/CC potatoes/NNS ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN make/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ omelettes/NNS which/WDT also/RB comes/VBZ with/IN toast/NN and/CC potatoes/NNS ./.
I/PRP got/VBD them/PRP to/TO put/VB in/IN mozzarella/NN ,/, onions/NNS and/CC green/JJ peppers/NNS ./.
The/DT breakfast/NN was/VBD quite/JJ nice/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ good/JJ and/CC the/DT server/NN comes/VBZ back/RB to/TO see/VB if/IN everything/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
The/DT price/NN point/NN for/IN the/DT quantity/NN and/CC quality/NN is/VBZ decent/JJ as/IN you/PRP come/VBD out/RP satisfied/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ not/RB to/TO big/JJ and/CC has/VBZ plenty/NN of/IN seating/VBG but/CC does/VBZ get/VB busy/NN on/IN weekends/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ plenty/NN of/IN parking/NN ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB take/VB so/RB long/RB for/IN us/PRP to/TO get/VB service/NN ./.
Honestly/RB other/JJ than/IN that/IN I/PRP really/RB dig/VBP the/DT environment/NN and/CC food/NN (/VBD the/DT food/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ )/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT bacon/NN waffle/NN and/CC black/NN coffee/NN ,/, both/DT fantastic/JJ (/NN and/CC finished/VB it/PRP !/-NONE- )/.
but/CC the/DT waitress/NN took/VBD another/DT tables/NNS order/NN that/IN sat/JJ after/IN us/PRP before/RB ours/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP perhaps/RB try/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT $/$ 4.99/CD breakfast/NN special/JJ which/NN is/VBZ only/RB served/VBN Monday/NNP to/TO Friday/NNP before/IN 11AM/CD ./.
You/PRP get/VBP 3/IN eggs/NNS ,/, one/CD choice/NN of/IN meat/NN (/NN ham/NN ,/, bacon/NN ,/, or/CC sausage/NN )/NN ,/, homefries/NNS ,/, 4/RB half/DT slices/NNS of/IN toast/NN (/NN white/JJ ,/, whole/JJ wheat/NN ,/, or/CC rye/VB )/JJ ,/, and/CC a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN fruit/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB added/VBD 2/CD pancakes/NNS for/IN $/$ 3.49/CD and/CC a/DT bottomless/NN coffee/NN for/IN $/$ 2.49/CD ./.
The/DT toast/NN is/VBZ buttered/VBN as/IN usual/JJ ./.
But/CC I/PRP was/VBD impressed/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ complimentary/JJ assortment/NN of/IN individually/RB packaged/JJ spreads/NNS ./.
I/PRP recall/VBP seeing/VBG :/: peanut/JJ butter/NN ,/, orange/JJ marmalade/NN ,/, strawberry/JJ and/CC raspberry/JJ and/CC blueberry/JJ jams/NNS ./.
My/NNP scrambled/VBD eggs/NNS were/VBD off-timed/JJ and/CC arrived/VBD a/DT little/JJ cold/NN ./.
The/DT sausages/NNS were/VBD n't/RB dripping/JJ in/IN grease/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB thick/JJ and/CC had/VBD great/JJ texture/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT huge/JJ fanatic/JJ of/IN pancakes/NNS but/CC they/PRP were/VBD nice/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ ./.
My/NNP favourite/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT breakfast/NN were/VBD those/DT homefries/NNS ./.
Oh/NNP man/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD still/RB thinking/VBG about/IN them/PRP on/IN the/DT drive/JJ from/IN work/NN ./.
The/DT homefries/NNS had/VBD a/DT thin/JJ yet/NN crispy/NN exterior/RB surrounding/VBG each/DT piece/NN ./.
They/PRP barely/RB had/VBD any/DT trace/NN of/IN excess/NN oil/NN and/CC were/VBD dusted/VBN with/IN some/DT red/JJ seasoning/NN to/TO give/VB them/PRP a/DT bit/NN of/IN flavour/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP could/MD taste/VB that/IN the/DT large/JJ pieces/NNS were/VBD not/RB as/IN thoroughly/RB cooked/VBN and/CC tender/JJ as/IN the/DT medium/NN and/CC small/JJ pieces/NNS ./.
But/CC I/PRP was/VBD given/VBN so/RB much/JJ potatoes/NNS in/IN a/DT wide/JJ assortment/NN of/IN sizes/NNS that/IN I/PRP could/MD work/VB around/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD so/RB stuffed/VBN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB think/VB about/IN lunch/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD pleasant/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ refills/NNS although/IN there/NNS were/VBD just/RB 4/JJ people/NNS at/IN 7:30am/CD ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/IN Panagio/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ addition/NN to/TO the/DT plaza/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN and/CC I/PRP 'll/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB !/.
Very/NNP disappointed/VBD !/CD !/NNS !/.
Is/NNP this/DT a/DT franchise/NN ?/.
Food/NNP is/VBZ salty/NN and/CC the/DT eggs/NNS they/PRP use/VBP are/VBP very/RB small/JJ ./.
I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP expensive/VBZ as/RB well/RB ./.
Close/NNP to/TO $/$ 20/CD with/IN my/CD 15/CD %/NN tip/NN for/IN 2/CD tiny/NN eggs/VBZ potatoes/NNS and/CC corn/NN beef/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN coffee/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD not/RB recommend/VB this/DT place/NN .../: .other/NN places/NNS are/VBP more/JJR reasonable/JJ ./.
Waitress/NNP is/VBZ very/RB nice/JJ and/CC quick/JJ in/IN her/PRP$ service/NN (/NN only/RB thing/IN I/PRP like/VBP )/RB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD to/TO Panagios/NNP with/IN 4/NNP friends/NNS on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP morning/NN for/IN Breakfast/Brunch/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB busy/JJ but/CC we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT spot/NN before/IN they/PRP filled/VBD up/RB ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB bright/JJ and/CC welcoming/JJ ,/, with/IN fun/JJ decor/NN painted/VBN onto/NN the/DT walls/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB wide/JJ array/NN of/IN breakfast/NN options/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD even/RB able/JJ to/TO accommodate/VB my/JJ friend/NN who/WP is/VBZ gluten-free/JJ ,/, lactose/JJ intolerant/NN ,/, and/CC allergic/JJ to/TO eggs/NNS !/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT breakfast/NN poutine/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC my/CD other/JJ friends/NNS enjoyed/VBD the/DT Oreo/NNP pancakes/NNS and/CC bacon/NN waffle/NN ./.
They/PRP both/VBP got/VBN rave/JJ reviews/NNS and/CC if/IN I/PRP went/VBP back/RB I/PRP would/MD probably/RB try/VB the/DT Oreo/NNP pancakes/NNS as/IN they/PRP looked/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ slow/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD expected/VBN for/IN a/DT busy/NN Saturday/NNP morning/NN at/IN a/DT breakfast/NN spot/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP were/VBD alright/VBN with/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP will/MD likely/VB return/NN to/TO Panagios/NNP to/TO try/VB other/JJ things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN :/: )/NNS ./.
A/DT group/NN of/IN friends/NNS and/CC I/PRP stopped/VBD by/IN this/DT place/NN on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT city/NN for/IN a/DT road/NN trip/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD not/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT wait/NN ,/, although/IN we/PRP had/VBD made/VBN reservations/NNS just/RB to/TO be/VB safe/JJ ./.
Although/IN the/DT service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ slow/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD worth/IN the/DT wait/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ ./.
I/PRP definitely/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
Busy/NNP restaurant/VBD for/IN breakfast/NN so/RB get/JJ ready/NN to/TO line/VB up/RP ./.
Great/NNP interior/RB decor/NN ./.

Awesome/JJ food/NN !/.
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ a/DT comfortable/JJ atmosphere/NN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ Oreo/NNP pancakes/NNS are/VBP a/DT must/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP pretty/RB sure/JJ I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB stop/VB to/TO breathe/VB while/IN eating/VBG them/PRP ./.
Great/NNP seasoning/NN on/IN the/DT home/NN fries/VBZ as/RB well/RB !/.

Decided/NNP to/TO give/VB the/DT new/JJ Panagio/NNP 's/POS in/IN Mississauga/NNP a/DT try/NN for/IN breakfast/brunch/NN ./.
Was/NNP surprised/VBD of/IN the/DT decade/NN since/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT breakfast/NN places/NNS in/IN Mississauga/NNP ,/, look/NN like/IN the/DT typical/JJ greasy/NN spoon/NN ./.
Nice/NNP wooden/VBD tables/NNS with/IN booths/NNS ./.
Got/NN there/EX just/RB around/IN 11am/CD and/CC only/RB had/VBD one/CD couple/NN in/IN line/NN ahead/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.
There/EX does/VBZ not/RB seem/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT hostess/NN and/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN the/DT servers/NNS do/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ seating/NN ./.
Was/NNP surprised/VBD when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN ahead/RB of/IN the/DT couple/NN that/IN was/VBD in/IN front/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT diced/JJ corned/JJ beef/NN with/IN homefries/NNS with/IN the/DT two/CD eggs/NNS ,/, eggs/NNS with/IN toast/NN and/CC fresh/JJ fruit/NN ,/, kids/NNS pancakes/NNS with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN bacon/NN ./.
All/DT meals/NNS were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT corned/JJ beef/NN was/VBD a/DT different/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT typical/JJ corned/JJ beef/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ meal/NN so/RB watch/VBD out/IN on/IN ordering/JJ sides/NNS ./.
Panagios/NNP to/TO me/PRP is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN your/PRP$ average/NN breakfast/NN dine-inn/JJ spot/NN !/.
I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN quite/RB a/DT few/JJ things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC this/DT includes/NN lunch/NN and/CC dessert/NN options/NNS ./.

Just/NNP a/DT bit/NN pricey/NN but/CC you/PRP will/MD leave/VB satisfied/JJ !/.
Service/NNP is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ here/RB as/RB well/RB !/.
3.5/CD star/NN ?/.
Come/NNP on/IN ,/, Yelpers/NNS ,/, how/WRB can/MD we/VB be/VB friends/NNS ?/.
Admittedly/RB ,/, it/PRP took/VBD me/PRP a/DT while/NN to/TO venture/NN to/TO Panagio/NNP 's/POS but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ mostly/RB because/IN I/PRP thought/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT greasy/JJ spoon/NN type/NN of/IN joint/NN ./.
Not/RB so/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN there/RB twice/JJ now/RB and/CC I/PRP 'll/MD definitely/RB keep/VB coming/VBG back/RB ./.
Best/NNP part/NN :/: it/PRP 's/VBZ closer/JJR to/TO my/PRP$ house/NN than/IN Sunny/NNP Morning/NNP ,/, which/WDT so/RB far/RB has/VBZ been/VBN my/VBN favourite/JJ breakfast/brunch/NN spot/NN in/IN Mississauga/NNP ./.
The/DT space/NN is/VBZ kinda/NN cool/NN ,/, with/IN plenty/NN of/IN tables/NNS and/CC a/DT nice/JJ decor/NN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ super/NN nice/NN and/CC quick/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Greek/NNP and/CC spinach/JJ and/CC feta/JJ omelettes/NNS ,/, breakfast/NN burrito/NN and/CC Pete/NNP 's/POS panini/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD really/RB tasty/JJ and/CC not/RB at/IN all/DT greasy/NN ./.
Their/NNP home/NN fries/NNS are/VBP yummy/JJ !/.
The/DT portions/NNS are/VBP generous/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ reasonably/RB priced/VBN ./.
I/PRP really/RB hope/VBP that/IN you/PRP can/MD look/VB past/IN the/DT 3.5/CD star/NN and/CC give/VB it/PRP a/DT try/NN !/.
Maybe/NNP I/PRP just/RB ordered/VBP the/DT wrong/JJ thing/NN because/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN does/VBZ not/RB jibe/VB with/IN the/DT other/JJ glowing/VBG reviews/NNS ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT California/NNP chicken/NN clubhouse/NN (/VBD no/DT mozzarella/NN )/NN with/IN onion/NN rings/NNS ./.
The/DT onion/NN rings/NNS were/VBD your/VBN standard/JJ frozen/NN onion/NN rings/NNS ./.
Nothing/NN to/TO get/VB excited/JJ about/IN ./.
Even/RB the/DT clubhouse/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/RB great/JJ as/IN the/DT description/NN sounded/VBD ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, guacamole/JJ ,/, yay/JJ !/.
But/CC there/EX was/VBD hardly/RB any/DT guac/NN on/IN my/PRP$ sandwich/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB flavourless/JJ ./.
My/NNP dining/NN companion/NN ordered/VBD the/DT eggs/NNS benny/NN and/CC he/PRP suspected/VBD the/DT Hollandaise/NN was/VBD from/IN a/DT mix/NN and/CC he/PRP was/VBD therefore/RB not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
I/PRP stumbled/VBD upon/IN this/DT gem/NN of/IN a/DT breakfast/NN establishment/NN one/CD morning/NN while/IN searching/NN for/IN something/NN other/JJ then/RB your/PRP$ generic/JJ Cora/NNP type/NN place/NN ./.

The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ just/RB as/IN wonderful/JJ ,/, they/PRP always/RB have/VBP great/JJ recommendations/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN to/TO another/DT breakfast/NN place/NN since/IN finding/VBG panagios/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ totally/RB worth/IN the/DT wait/NN !/NN !/.
Mississauga/NNP needed/VBD a/DT place/NN like/IN this/DT and/CC panagios/VBZ filled/VBN the/DT void/JJ !/NN
Not/RB sure/JJ what/WP the/DT craze/NN is/VBZ about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Would/NNP rather/VBD go/CD to/TO any/DT other/JJ breakfast/NN place/NN ./.
Too/NNP much/JJ time/NN was/VBD placed/VBN on/IN the/DT seemingly/JJ witty/NN pop/NN culture/NN nicknames/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC not/RB enough/JJ time/NN teaching/NN service/NN and/CC crafting/VBG a/DT good/JJ menu/NN ./.
Guacamole/NNP advertised/VBD but/CC came/VBD as/IN a/DT paste/NN ,/, laughable/JJ that/IN places/NNS still/RB serve/VBP this/DT !/NN
What/WP was/VBD unfortunate/JJ is/VBZ our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD training/VBN another/DT server/NN and/CC not/RB once/RB was/VBD my/VBN water/NN refilled/VBD or/CC coffee/NN ./.
Only/RB came/VBD to/TO drop/NN off/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC to/TO bill/NN ./.

'Everything/NN 's/POS good/JJ '/NN ./.
Also/RB the/DT washroom/NN smelled/VBD like/IN death/NN ./.
Not/RB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN to/TO write/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD less/JJR than/IN mediocre/NN ,/, poutine/NN had/VBD potential/JJ but/CC fell/VBD flat/JJ ./.
We/PRP have/VBP never/RB are/VBP inside/JJ yet/RB ./.
We/PRP usually/RB get/VBP an/DT omelette/NN or/CC something/NN to/TO brin/VB home/NN and/CC share/NN with/IN the/DT kids/NNS ./.
Omelettes/NNS are/VBP berry/JJ good/JJ ,/, will/MD need/VB to/TO try/VB other/JJ things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ nicely/RB presented/JJ ,/, a/DT nice/JJ smile/NN from/IN our/PRP$ server/NN ,/, fast/VBP service/NN even/RB thought/IN it/PRP was/VBD busy/JJ ,/, coffee/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, friendly/RB place/NN ,/, I/PRP like/IN it/PRP ./.

Be/NNP warned/VBD that/IN you/PRP may/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB a/DT bit/NN but/CC a/DT line/NN up/IN also/RB tells/VBZ you/PRP that/IN their/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC worth/JJ trying/NNS ./.
Food/NNP :/: Lots/NNS of/IN variety/NN ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP bound/NN to/TO find/VB something/NN you/PRP want/VBP ./.
Our/NNP group/NN ordered/VBD a/DT variety/NN of/IN items/NNS from/IN Big/NNP Breakfast/NNP to/TO omelette/VB ,/, hash/JJ ,/, grilled/JJ cheese/NN and/CC soup/NN ./.

They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB '/VB rush/JJ you/PRP even/RB if/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT line/NN up/IN ./.

We/PRP got/VBD the/DT big/JJ breakfast/NN ,/, huevos/NNS of/IN the/DT ranch/NN and/CC the/DT piggy/NN smalls/VBZ poutine/NN ./.
The/DT big/JJ breakfast/NN was/VBD typical/JJ ,/, but/CC their/PRP$ bacon/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN perfectly/RB ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, we/PRP checked/VBD out/IN the/DT big/JJ take-out/NN menu/NN that/WDT was/VBD hanging/VBG on/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.
Panagio/NNP 's/POS offers/NNS everything/NN from/IN typical/JJ breakfast/NN eats/NNS ,/, including/VBG pancakes/NNS ,/, waffles/NNS and/CC sandwiches/NNS ,/, to/TO burritos/NNS ,/, grilled/VBD cheese/NN ,/, poutines/NNS ,/, burgers/NNS ,/, soups/NNS and/CC salads/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ better/JJR than/IN your/PRP$ typical/JJ breakfast/NN joint/NN !/.
Seeing/NNP as/IN the/DT menu/NN was/VBD so/RB extensive/JJ ,/, once/RB we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN ,/, we/PRP asked/VBD the/DT server/NN if/IN she/PRP had/VBD any/DT recommendations/NNS ./.

The/DT BEST/NNP part/NN about/IN my/PRP$ breakfast/NN was/VBD the/DT Oreo/NNP pancakes/NNS .../: by/IN far/RB ./.
