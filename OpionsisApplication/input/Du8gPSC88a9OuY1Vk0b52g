It/PRP 's/VBZ family/NN owned/NN and/CC ran/VBD so/IN you/PRP see/VBP the/DT same/JJ people/NNS all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT very/RB fancy/JJ looking/VBG place/NN cuz/NN it/PRP a/DT pink/NN building/NN filled/VBD with/IN old/JJ table/JJ and/CC chairs/VBZ that/IN wobble/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT real/JJ old-fashioned/JJ ice/NN cream/NN parlor/NN and/CC I/PRP swear/JJ they/PRP 've/VBP kept/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ furniture/NN haha/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP old-school/JJ looking/NN pictures/NNS and/CC posters/NNS up/RB and/CC could/MD really/RB use/VB a/DT make/NN over/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ no/DT effect/NN on/IN their/PRP$ food/NN or/CC ice/NN cream/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT lunch/NN special/NN that/WDT gets/NNS you/PRP a/DT free/JJ root/NN beer/NN float/NN if/IN you/PRP order/VBP a/DT sandwich/JJ or/CC burger/JJR before/IN 4pm/CD ./.

The/DT fries/NNS are/VBP really/RB crispy/JJ and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB good/JJ eatin/NN '/'' ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP the/DT best/JJ thing/NN on/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN cuz/NN I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN with/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN their/PRP$ sandwiches/NNS before/IN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB simple/JJ food/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP exactly/RB what/WP I/PRP expect/VBP and/CC what/WP I/PRP want/VBP from/IN there/RB ./.
Old/NNP fashioned/VBD ice/JJ cream/NN parlor/NN with/IN tasty/JJ banana/NN split/NN ,/, good/JJ kids/NN menu/NN ,/, and/CC nice/JJ place/NN to/TO bring/VB kids/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN compared/VBN to/TO Fentons/NNS ,/, but/CC hey/JJ .../: old/JJ fashioned/VBN ice/NN cream/NN shops/NNS are/VBP dissipating/VBG so/RB lets/VBZ keep/NN supporting/VBG this/DT place/NN so/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB close/VB down/RB ./.
I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ those/DT who/WP payed/VBN for/IN a/DT plaque/NN will/MD be/VB super/JJ sad/JJ ./.

I/PRP went/VBD here/RB last/JJ night/NN to/TO try/VB the/DT place/NN out/IN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD OK/NNP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB close/JJ to/TO closing/JJ time/NN arriving/VBG at/IN around/IN 9:45/CD ./.
The/DT woman/NN was/VBD pleasant/JJ and/CC she/PRP made/VBD my/JJ sundae/NN quickly/RB ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT Black/NNP and/CC Tan/NNP Sundae/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ described/RB by/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN as/IN :/: Creamy/NNP vanilla/NNP and/CC toasted/VBD almond/NN ice/NN cream/NN drowned/VBD in/IN Leatherby/NNP 's/POS caramel/NN and/CC chocolate/NN fudge/NN ,/, topped/VBD with/IN whipped/JJ cream/NN ,/, nuts/NNS and/CC a/DT cherry/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC at/IN $/$ 7.35/CD plus/NNS tax/NN for/IN two/CD scoops/NNS of/IN ice/JJ cream/NN ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ too/RB pricey/JJ ./.
For/IN that/DT amount/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD be/VB sitting/VBG in/IN Max/NNP Brenner/NNP 's/POS in/IN the/DT Forum/NNP Shoppes/NNP and/CC not/RB in/IN a/DT run/NN down/RB ,/, older/RB restaurant/VBD that/IN has/VBZ seen/VBN better/JJ days/NNS ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN about/IN this/DT place/NN from/IN a/DT few/JJ people/NNS ./.
When/WRB I/PRP went/VBD in/IN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN shocked/VBN by/IN the/DT small/JJ menu/NN for/IN sandwiches/NNS and/CC burgers/NNS etc/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ mostly/RB ice/JJ cream/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD n't/RB the/DT impression/NN I/PRP was/VBD given/VBN by/IN people/NNS who/WP had/VBD talked/VBN about/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ sparsely/RB decorated/VBN ./.

The/DT milkshakes/NNS we/PRP had/VBD with/IN our/PRP$ lunch/NN were/VBD also/RB quite/JJ good/JJ ./.
Not/RB overpowering/VBG in/IN taste/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB sickeningly/RB sweet/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ real/JJ negative/NN I/PRP found/VBD with/IN the/DT place/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT seating/NN is/VBZ very/RB uncomfortable/JJ ./.
They/PRP could/MD really/RB use/VB a/DT few/JJ booths/NNS and/CC some/DT nicer/NN tables/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP guessing/VBG part/NN of/IN this/DT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO the/DT economy/NN ,/, however/RB ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ?/.
I/PRP 'll/VBP go/JJ back/RB and/CC try/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.

Please/NNP save/JJ yourself/NN from/IN headache/NN and/CC leaving/NN on/IN an/DT empty/NN stomach/NN ./.

Ok/IN I/PRP was/VBD super/JJ impressed/VBN by/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN ice/NN cream/NN they/PRP could/MD fit/VB in/IN a/DT banana/NN split/NN !/.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT lunch/NN special/NN with/IN a/DT sandwich/JJ ./.
It/PRP made/VBD me/PRP feel/VBP like/IN a/DT little/JJ kid/NN in/IN a/DT pop/NN shop/NN !/.
apparently/RB ,/, this/DT place/NN used/VBD to/TO be/VB quite/RB the/DT hot/NN spot/NN back/RB in/IN the/DT days/NNS ./.
Now/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ run/JJ down/NNS and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ a/DT horror/NN ./.
Got/IN the/DT philly/RB cheesteak/NN sandwich/JJ which/NN was/VBD not/RB that/IN great/JJ ./.
Tasted/VBN like/IN a/DT frozen/NN microwaveable/JJ hot/NN pocket/NN ./.
Not/RB to/TO mention/NN there/EX was/VBD a/DT skin/NN of/IN an/DT onion/NN (/NN gross/VBZ )/JJ wedged/JJ in/IN there/NNP ./.
The/DT ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO be/VB homemade/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD vanilla/JJ flavor/NN topped/VBD with/IN hot/NN fudge/NN ,/, caramel/NN ,/, and/CC bananas/NNS ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, by/IN this/DT time/NN I/PRP was/VBD so/RB turned/JJ off/IN I/PRP could/MD n't/RB enjoy/VB it/PRP ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN about/IN this/DT place/NN time/NN and/CC time/NN again/RB ./.
That/DT if/IN you/PRP do/VBP a/DT throw/NN down/IN with/IN the/DT ice/NN cream/NN banana/NN split/NN (/VBD large/JJ in/IN proportion/NN mind/IN you/PRP )/VBP that/IN you/PRP get/VB your/PRP$ name/NN up/RB on/IN the/DT famous/JJ wall/NN ./.
On/IN a/DT most/RBS recent/JJ trip/NN down/IN to/TO Las/NNP Vegas/NNP our/NNP friends/VBZ had/VBD dared/VBN another/DT one/NN of/IN our/PRP$ friends/NNS to/TO do/VB accept/VB the/DT challenge/NN ./.
After/IN doing/VBG a/DT late/JJ check/NN out/IN of/IN our/PRP$ hotel/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD stumped/VBN ./.
To/TO watch/DT our/NN dear/NN friend/NN dare/VBP the/DT challenge/NN of/IN ice/JJ cream/NN mayhem/NN or/CC to/TO satisfy/JJ this/DT inevitable/JJ appetite/NN calling/VBG out/IN to/TO us/PRP ./.
7/7/CD agree/NN ,/, the/DT starvation/NN had/VBD to/TO insatiably/RB meet/VB our/PRP$ mouths/NNS and/CC stomachs/NNS ./.
--/: After/JJ lunch/NN --/: -/JJ We/PRP finally/RB headed/VBD out/IN to/TO Leatherby/NNP 's/POS Ice/NNP Cream/NNP Shop/NNP anyways/VBZ to/TO check/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
Whether/NNP he/PRP was/VBD up/RB for/IN it/PRP or/CC not/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD still/RB worth/JJ checking/VBG out/RP ./.
Our/NNP friend/NN did/VBD not/RB end/VB up/RP trekking/VBG the/DT challenge/NN due/JJ to/TO a/DT stuffed/JJ tummy/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP did/VBD end/VB up/RP grabbing/VBG a/DT scoop/NN of/IN ice/JJ cream/NN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
Their/NNP ice/NNP cream/NN is/VBZ homemade/NN and/CC this/DT quaint/NN establishment/NN is/VBZ family/NN owned/NN ./.
My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN a/DT scoop/JJ each/NN of/IN our/PRP$ favorite/JJ flavors/NNS and/CC granted/VBN we/PRP only/RB wanted/VBD one/CD scoop/NN ,/, we/PRP got/VBD two/CD !/.
Their/PRP$ portions/NNS are/VBP HUGE/NNP !/.
Not/RB the/DT fanciest/JJS place/NN around/NN ,/, but/CC sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB about/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT gadgets/NNS and/CC gizmos/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ about/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, quality/NN and/CC the/DT homemade/NN loved/VBD ice/NN cream/NN just/RB for/IN you/PRP ./.
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ been/VBN run/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT times/NNS ,/, but/CC BF/NNP took/VBD me/PRP for/IN some/DT homemade/NN ice/NN cream/NN ./.
Kinda/NNP odd/VBD location/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP suppose/VBP at/IN one/CD point/NN this/DT was/VBD a/DT good/JJ location/NN for/IN them/PRP before/IN Vegas/NNP changed/NNP ./.
I/PRP really/RB like/IN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP peanut/VBN butter/JJ sauce/NN here/RB and/CC couldnt/VB resist/VBP a/DT peanut/NN buttery/NN sundae/NN to/TO split/VB ./.
We/PRP shared/VBD ,/, but/CC could/MD n't/RB finish/VB it/PRP and/CC probably/RB needed/VBD a/DT 3rd/CD person/NN to/TO polish/VB this/DT off/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ vanilla/NN was/VBD creamy/NN and/CC consistent/NN texture/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN not/RB much/JJ people/NNS coming/VBG in/IN I/PRP can/MD see/VB how/WRB some/DT of/IN the/DT unpopular/JJ flavors/NNS can/MD get/VB icey/NN since/IN the/DT other/JJ ice/NN cream/NN scoops/NNS flavors/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ sundae/NN had/VBD some/DT ice/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
Food/NNP decet-/JJ not/RB something/NN I/PRP 'd/MD come/VB drive/JJ for/IN ,/, but/CC if/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP there/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT bad/JJ idea/NN to/TO grab/VB a/DT diner-eque/JJ sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT server/NN is/VBZ kooky/NN in/IN a/DT cute/JJ way/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB sweet/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ./.
If/IN it/PRP wasnt/VBD so/RB far/RB off/IN location/NN for/IN us/PRP ,/, Id/NNP probably/RB come/VBN back/RB for/IN some/DT ice/JJ cream/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, if/IN they/PRP were/VBD to/TO move/VB again/RB they/PRP probably/RB can/MD drum/VB up/RP some/DT business/NN ./.
It/PRP 'll/MD be/VB some/DT time/NN before/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP on/IN that/DT side/NN of/IN town/NN to/TO drop/NN in/IN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP appreciate/RB keeping/VB homemade/NN ,/, real/JJ and/CC having/VBG the/DT ma/NN and/CC pa/NN feel/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ another/DT one/NN of/IN those/DT seemingly/RB small/JJ local/JJ businesses/NNS that/WDT deserve/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN business/NN ./.
It/PRP may/MD be/VB struggling/VBG now/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT location/NN ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ sketchy/JJ passers/NNS by/IN that/DT libe/NN in/IN the/DT ``/`` budget/NN ''/'' apartments/NNS nearby/RB ,/, the/DT type/NN that/IN house/NN a/DT group/NN of/IN 12/CD per/IN room/NN ./.

I/PRP really/VBP need/JJ to/TO bring/VB my/PRP$ camera/NN here/RB next/JJ time/NN we/PRP go/VBP ./.
