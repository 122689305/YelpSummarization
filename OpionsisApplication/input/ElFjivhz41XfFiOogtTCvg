This/DT place/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ before/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB anymore/RB ./.
They/PRP started/VBD doing/VBG $/$ 5/CD express/NN takeout/NN and/CC $/$ 3/CD breakfast/NN and/CC last/JJ week/NN they/PRP changed/VBD menu/NN (/NNS not/RB reflected/VBN on/IN website/JJ yet/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT original/JJ menu/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC food/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC now/RB they/PRP dropped/VBD the/DT price/NN by/IN quite/RB a/DT lot/NN (/NN for/IN example/NN risotto/NN from/IN ~/NNP $/$ 25/CD to/TO ~/VB $/$ 15/CD )/CD ./.
I/PRP think/VBP this/DT place/NN has/VBZ shifted/VBN to/TO a/DT cheap/NN mediocre/NN shop/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/VBG a/DT nice/JJ dining/VBG choice/NN of/IN mine/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD try/VB their/PRP$ express/NN takeout/NN just/RB out/IN of/IN curiosity/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/VBD got/VBD a/DT good/JJ deal/NN online/NN for/IN a/DT 4/NN course/NN meal/NN for/IN this/DT resturant/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN whether/IN they/PRP were/VBD under/IN staff/NN or/CC not/RB but/CC that/DT shouldnt/NN be/VB the/DT issue/NN ,/, they/PRP couldve/VBP let/VBN us/PRP know/VBP for/IN a/DT heads/VBZ up/RP and/CC not/RB make/VB us/PRP wait/VB for/IN each/DT meal/NN ./.
My/NNP first/RB experience/VBD at/IN vino/NN rosso/NN was/VBD horrible/JJ and/CC this/DT was/VBD on/IN Valentine/NNP 's/POS day/NN ./.
Dont/NNP get/VBD me/PRP wrong/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ but/CC the/DT SERVICE/NNP was/VBD hell/JJ ./.
They/PRP questioned/VBD us/PRP back/RB if/IN we/PRP wanted/VBP water/NN when/WRB we/PRP clearly/VBP wanted/VBN water/NN and/CC they/PRP shouldve/VBP given/VBN water/NN when/WRB we/PRP first/RB sat/JJ down/IN ,/, i/RB think/VBP that/DT is/VBZ proper/NN service/NN 101/CD for/IN any/DT resturant/NN ./.
Literally/RB took/VBD them/PRP 20-30/JJ minutes/NNS for/IN each/DT dish/JJ to/TO come/VB out/RP ./.
Whole/NNP experience/NN was/VBD feeling/VBG agitated/VBN and/CC anxious/JJ ./.

The/DT customers/NNS to/TO the/DT right/NN wasnt/NN too/RB happy/JJ either/NN about/IN their/PRP$ service/NN ,/, when/WRB they/PRP sat/VBP down/RB ,/, they/PRP waited/VBD probably/RB about/IN 20/CD minute/JJ to/TO take/VB their/PRP$ order/NN and/CC they/PRP had/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT waiter'waitress/NN attention/NN ./.
By/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP told/VBD ourselve/NN that/IN we/PRP wouldve/VBP rather/RB stayed/VBN in/IN and/CC order/NN take/VB out/RP and/CC not/RB have/VB dealt/NN with/IN the/DT experience/NN and/CC expecially/RB how/WRB cold/JJ it/PRP was/VBD outside/JJ ./.
A/DT group/NN of/IN co-workers/NNS decided/VBD to/TO go/VB here/RB for/IN summerlicious/JJ ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, summerlicious/JJ is/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN for/IN restaurants/NNS to/TO put/VB out/RP there/RB their/PRP$ best/NN food/NN so/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC pay/VB regular/JJ price/NN for/IN it/PRP .../VBD .well/NN this/DT place/NN completely/RB missed/VBD the/DT mark/NN on/IN that/DT ./.
The/DT menu/NN sounded/VBD appetizing/VBG but/CC it/PRP began/VBD with/IN the/DT server/NN bringing/VBG water/NN to/TO the/DT table/JJ and/CC proceeding/VBG to/TO ask/VB us/PRP for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN orders/NNS ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ all/DT fine/NN but/CC then/RB she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB ask/VB if/IN anyone/NN wanted/VBD a/DT drink/NN (/IN other/JJ than/IN the/DT water/NN )/NN ./.
Once/NNP our/VBD food/NN came/VBD out/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT disappointment/NN after/IN disappointment/NN ,/, some/DT food/NN was/VBD cold/JJ ,/, tasted/VBN like/IN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN re-heated/VBN and/CC the/DT best/JJS parts/NNS of/IN anything/NN was/VBD the/DT sauces/NNS put/VBD on/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
Definitely/RB not/RB going/VB back/RB here/RB ./.
Visited/NNP Vino/NNP Rosso/NNP for/IN Summerlicious/NNP ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ even/RB though/IN my/PRP$ table/NN was/VBD the/DT only/JJ party/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN (/NN this/DT should/MD have/VB tipped/VBN us/PRP off/RP about/IN the/DT quality/NN already/RB )/JJ ./.
No/DT kidding/NN ,/, the/DT entire/JJ place/NN was/VBD empty/JJ except/NN for/IN us/PRP !/.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB picky/JJ about/IN my/CD bread/JJ but/CC the/DT constant/NN disruption/NN was/VBD not/RB appreciated/VBN and/CC made/VBN me/PRP feel/VBP like/IN the/DT service/NN was/VBD lagging/VBG ./.
I/PRP found/VBD myself/JJ frustrated/VBN again/RB when/WRB (/JJ 1/CD )/CD our/NNS waiter/VBP offered/VBN to/TO refill/NN our/NN water/NN and/CC never/RB came/VBD back/RB with/IN it/PRP (/RB 2/VBP )/JJ we/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB twice/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT bill/NN and/CC (/NN 3/NN )/IN it/PRP took/VBD forever/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT bill/NN ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, considering/VBG there/EX were/VBD no/DT other/JJ tables/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD equally/RB underwhelming/JJ ./.
The/DT bread/NN was/VBD gross/NNS ,/, nothing/NN more/NN to/TO say/VB ./.
The/DT Caprese/NNP Insalata/NNP was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC nothing/JJ special/NN ./.
My/NNP main/NNP ,/, a/DT Penne/NNP Arrabiata/NNP ,/, tasted/VBD like/IN glorified/VBN penne/NN swimming/VBG in/IN spicy/NN tomato/NN sauce/NN ./.

My/NNP dining/NN companion/NN had/VBD the/DT lobster/NN ravioli/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD the/DT salmon/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD never/RB set/VB foot/NN in/IN it/PRP or/CC speak/VB well/RB of/IN the/DT place/NN as/IN this/DT restaurant/NN in/IN June/NNP wanted/NNP new/JJ customers/NNS so/IN they/PRP offered/VBD a/DT discount/NN through/IN Buytopia/NNP --/: $/$ 15/CD spent/-NONE- for/IN a/DT $/$ 30/CD food/NN voucher/NN ./.

I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT man/NN I/PRP was/VBD speaking/VBG to/TO whether/IN the/DT voucher/NN would/MD be/VB honoured/VBN later/JJ than/IN the/DT expiry/NN date/NN ,/, considering/VBG that/IN it/PRP was/VBD their/PRP$ fault/NN that/IN I/PRP could/MD not/RB redeem/VB the/DT voucher/NN ./.

A/DT quaint/JJ little/NN restaurant/NN ./.

They/PRP tried/VBD to/TO recook/VB it/PRP and/CC made/VBD it/PRP worse/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD now/RB so/RB chewy/JJ that/IN my/PRP$ associate/NN lost/VBD her/PRP appetite/RB ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN the/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
There/EX server/NN was/VBD empathetic/JJ and/CC tried/JJ to/TO make/VB it/PRP right/RB ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ only/RB so/RB much/JJ he/PRP could/MD do/VB ./.
**EDIT**/NNP As/NNP per/IN the/DT Owners/NNPS Response/NNP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD mention/NN above/IN I/PRP used/VBP a/DT TravelZoo/NNP voucher/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN mentions/NNS that/WDT no/DT bill/NN was/VBD bought/VBN to/TO the/DT table/JJ ./.
He/PRP is/VBZ correct/NN ,/, we/PRP already/RB paid/VBN $/$ 49/CD for/IN the/DT voucher/NN ,/, so/RB more/JJR than/IN 3/4/CD portion/NN of/IN it/PRP was/VBD already/RB paid/VBN for/IN ./.
My/NNP comment/NN was/VBD for/IN the/DT food/NN alone/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/NN out/IN is/VBZ the/DT Salmon/NNP was/VBD RAW/NNP inside/NN ,/, not/RB medium/NN rare/NN ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN I/PRP know/VBP in/IN Ontario/NNP food/NN must/MD be/VB cooked/VBN well/RB unless/IN advised/VBN by/IN the/DT customer/NN (/NN for/IN steaks/NNS ,/, etc/JJ )/NN ./.
So/IN unless/IN I/PRP am/VBP mistaken/RB ,/, what/WP I/PRP read/VBP from/IN the/DT owners/NNS response/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN if/IN you/PRP do/VBP come/VBN here/RB for/IN any/DT special/JJ or/CC voucher/JJR and/CC if/IN the/DT food/NN turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO be/VB uncooked/JJ ,/, you/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO be/VB upset/JJ or/CC post/JJ any/DT negative/JJ reviews/NNS ./.
Came/NN here/RB on/IN a/DT Thursday/NNP night/NN with/IN a/DT Buytopia/NNP deal/NN for/IN a/DT 3/NN course/NN meal/NN for/IN 2/CD people/NNS that/IN comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT glass/NN of/IN wine/NN or/CC beer/NN ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO call/NNP ahead/RB to/TO make/VB a/DT reservation/NN but/CC the/DT phone/NN number/NN for/IN the/DT restaurant/NN does/VBZ not/RB work/VB during/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, it/PRP rings/VBZ once/RB then/RB goes/VBZ to/TO a/DT recorded/VBN message/NN ``/`` Sorry/NNP the/DT number/NN you/PRP have/VBP called/VBN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT sign/NN ''/'' ./.
I/PRP called/VBD almost/RB every/DT hour/NN from/IN 12/CD until/IN 5pm/CD and/CC finally/RB by/IN 6pm/CD ,/, the/DT call/NN gets/VBZ through/IN ./.
Super/NNP weird/VBD !/.
When/WRB we/PRP got/VBP there/RB ,/, the/DT place/NN had/VBD a/DT few/JJ tables/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT vibe/NN felt/VBD very/RB empty/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD one/CD server/NN working/VBG all/DT night/NN ./.
She/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN she/PRP was/VBD either/JJ new/JJ or/CC have/VBP barely/RB any/DT experience/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
She/PRP gave/VBD us/PRP the/DT set/NN menu/NN to/TO choose/NN as/IN we/PRP showed/VBD her/PRP the/DT deal/NN ./.
She/PRP came/VBD back/RB every/DT 5/NN mins/VBZ asking/NN if/IN we/PRP were/VBD ready/NN and/CC every/DT time/NN we/PRP would/MD say/VB we/PRP need/VBP more/JJR time/NN ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD for/IN water/NN to/TO start/VB off/RP our/PRP$ meal/NN and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB it/PRP until/IN 15/CD mins/NNS later/JJ after/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
And/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO remind/VB her/PRP one/CD last/JJ time/NN before/IN she/PRP came/VBD with/IN it/PRP ,/, most/JJS likely/JJ have/VBP forgotten/VBN when/WRB there/EX 's/VBZ only/RB one/CD other/JJ table/JJ in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
She/PRP brought/VBD over/IN some/DT bread/JJ ,/, which/WDT seemed/NNS like/IN its/PRP$ homemade/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ olive/NN oil/NN drizzled/VBD on/IN top/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
But/CC as/IN I/PRP took/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN into/IN the/DT bread/JJ ,/, I/PRP spilt/VBP it/PRP right/VBD out/RP !/NNP !/.
It/PRP was/VBD SUPER/NNP SALTY/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
Like/IN it/PRP was/VBD dipped/VBN in/IN salt/NN or/CC something/NN !/NN !/.
Our/NNP appetizers/NNS came/VBD which/WDT was/VBD the/DT grilled/JJ calamari/NN and/CC crab/NN cakes/NNS ./.
BOTH/NNP were/VBD SALTY/NNP as/IN well/RB !/.
Calamari/NNP was/VBD cold/JJ topped/VBN with/IN some/DT homemade/NN salsa/NN which/WDT tasted/VBN like/IN diced/JJ tomatoes/NNS and/CC onions/NNS tossed/VBD in/IN olive/JJ oil/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD canned/VBN grilled/JJ red/VBN peppers/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN but/CC they/PRP were/VBD cold/JJ as/IN if/IN they/PRP literally/RB came/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT fridge/NN ./.
The/DT crab/NN cake/NN was/VBD one/CD round/NN piece/NN size/NN of/IN your/PRP$ palm/NN cut/VBD in/IN half/NN ./.
I/PRP only/RB tasted/VBD potatoes/NNS ,/, corn/NN and/CC carrots/NNS ./.
There/EX was/VBD no/DT crab/NN or/CC did/VBD n't/RB see/VB any/DT sight/NN of/IN crab/NN ./.
Tasted/VBN like/IN I/PRP was/VBD eating/VBG potato/NN cakes/NNS instead/RB ./.
SUPER/NNP DISAPPOINTING/NNP !/NNP !/.
The/DT mains/NNS came/VBD ,/, which/WDT were/VBD a/DT tapilia/NN and/CC 7oz/CD steak/NN ,/, both/DT with/IN vegetables/NNS ./.
The/DT tapilia/NN was/VBD dry/JJ and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN the/DT freezer/NN for/IN ages/NNS ,/, it/PRP had/VBD a/DT FREEZER/NNP TASTE/NNP !/.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN at/IN the/DT right/NN color/NN but/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD stale/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD tell/VB by/IN the/DT texture/NN that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT old/JJ piece/NN of/IN steak/NN ./.
The/DT texture/NN felt/VBD like/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT medium/NN well/RB when/WRB I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT medium/NN rare/NN ,/, it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN a/DT medium/NN rare/JJ though/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP got/VBD so/RB confused/VBN ./.
The/DT steamed/boiled/JJ vegetables/NNS were/VBD the/DT WORSE/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
One/CD big/JJ piece/NN of/IN brocoli/NN that/IN had/NN to/TO be/VB boiled/VBN for/IN over/IN 10/CD mins/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD MUSHY/NNP like/IN baby/JJ food/NN !/.
The/DT carrots/NNS were/VBD also/RB OVERCOOKED/NNP and/CC MUSHY/NNP ,/, also/RB like/IN baby/NN food/NN !/NN !/.
The/DT potatoes/NNS were/VBD yukon/VBN gold/NN ,/, cut/VBD up/RP into/IN BIG/NNP chunks/NNS ,/, some/DT were/VBD also/RB overcooked/VBN so/IN it/PRP was/VBD MUSHY/NNP but/CC there/NNP was/VBD one/CD piece/NN that/IN was/VBD RARE/NNP ,/, CRUNCHY/NNP when/WRB I/PRP bit/VBP into/IN it/PRP ./.
WORSE/NNP VEGETABLES/NNP I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN eaten/JJ !/NN !/.
Desserts/NNS were/VBD a/DT tiramisu/NN and/CC new/JJ york/NN cheesecake/NN ./.
The/DT cheesecake/NN tastes/VBZ okay/NN since/IN you/PRP can/MD tell/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD store/JJ brought/NN and/CC not/RB made/VBD in/IN house/NN ./.
The/DT tiramisu/NN tasted/VBD okay/NN but/CC texture/NN was/VBD SUPER/NNP MUSHY/NNP !/NNP !/.
Overall/NNP ,/, EVERYTHING/NNP IS/NNP BAD/NNP !/NNP !/.
FOOD/NNP IS/NNP SALTY/NNP ,/, MUSHY/NNP ,/, totally/RB NOT/NNP SUPPOSE/NNP TO/NNP BE/NNP WHAT/NNP IT/NNP TASTED/NNP !/NNP !/.
The/DT waitress/NN was/VBD weird/JJ all/DT night/NN ,/, everytime/NN coming/VBG to/TO the/DT table/JJ making/VBG it/PRP very/RB awkward/VBP ;/: either/NNP trying/NNP to/TO rearrange/VB the/DT dishes/NNS to/TO make/VB it/PRP seem/VB more/RBR convinent/JJ for/IN us/PRP but/CC actually/RB not/RB ,/, trying/VBG to/TO ask/VB us/PRP about/IN the/DT food/NN but/CC reacting/VBG in/IN an/DT awkward/NN way/NN ,/, it/PRP just/RB made/VBD us/PRP feel/VBP UNEASY/NNP !/.
WILL/NNP NEVER/NNP COME/NNP BACK/NNP AND/NNP DO/NNP N'T/NNP SUGGEST/NNP ANYONE/NNP COMING/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
!/NN
First/NNP let/NNP 's/POS mention/NN that/IN this/DT place/NN offers/VBZ halal/JJ meat/NN and/CC does/VBZ not/RB serve/VB pork/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP use/RB wine/VB to/TO cook/JJ but/CC if/IN you/PRP mention/VBP that/IN you/PRP eat/VBP halal/JJ ,/, they/PRP can/MD make/VB substations/NNS for/IN you/PRP ./.
Now/RB ,/, I/PRP came/VBD here/RB with/IN old/JJ colleagues/NNS for/IN summerlicious/JJ and/CC to/TO catch/NN up/IN ./.
We/PRP made/VBD reservations/NNS for/IN 6pm/CD ./.
When/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD ,/, one/CD of/IN party/NN was/VBD running/VBG late/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT server/NN kept/VBD coming/VBG around/IN to/TO refill/NN glasses/NNS and/CC check/NN up/RP on/IN us/PRP ./.
When/WRB everyone/NN was/VBD here/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, they/PRP tried/VBD to/TO rush/JJ us/NNS into/IN ordering/VBG a/DT little/JJ ./.
Eventually/RB they/PRP stopped/VBP ,/, to/TO the/DT point/NN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO then/RB call/VB them/PRP over/IN when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD all/DT ready/NN to/TO order/NN ./.
The/DT excellent/JJ part/NN is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN us/PRP were/VBD torn/VBN on/IN what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBP ./.
They/PRP were/VBD really/RB nice/JJ and/CC offered/VBD us/PRP to/TO somewhat/VB combine/NN dishes/NNS ./.
They/PRP usually/VBP offer/NN a/DT substitution/NN for/IN the/DT steak/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN mashed/JJ potatoes/NNS and/CC veggies/NNS you/PRP can/MD get/VB pasta/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT pasta/NN is/VBZ usually/RB like/IN penne/NN ./.
Thy/NNP graciously/RB allowed/VBD us/PRP to/TO have/VB lobster/JJ ravioli/NN as/IN out/JJ pasta/NN side/NN ./.
Two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN ravioli/NN (/IN the/DT actually/RB dish/JJ has/VBZ 6/VBN pieces/NNS )/VBP with/IN our/PRP$ steak/NN ./.
We/PRP even/RB got/VBD complimentary/JJ veggies/NNS to/TO share/NN amongst/VB the/DT four/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.
The/DT downside/NN to/TO this/DT great/JJ offer/NN was/VBD that/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT medium/NN steak/NN and/CC got/VBD something/NN closer/NN to/TO medium-well/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT lobster/NN ravioli/NN was/VBD n't/RB that/IN great/JJ ./.
Although/IN the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
For/IN our/PRP$ apps/NNS we/PRP had/VBD gotten/VBN calamari/NN ,/, meatballs/NNS and/CC crab/NN cake/NN ./.
The/DT crab/NN cake/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ lonely/NN ,/, just/RB one/CD cake/NN ./.
The/DT meatballs/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ./.
But/CC tiny/NN and/CC only/RB four/CD ./.
The/DT calamari/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT most/JJS pathetic/JJ part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN was/VBD the/DT dessert/NN ./.
When/WRB put/JJ together/NN it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB yummy/JJ ,/, esp/VB the/DT ricotta/NN gelato/NN ./.
The/DT brownie/NN was/VBD okay/NN and/CC the/DT poached/VBN pear/NN looked/VBD like/IN tuna/NN sashimi/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD yummy/JJ but/CC two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN it/PRP was/VBD too/RB much/RB for/IN the/DT tiny/NN dollop/NN of/IN gelato/NN ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP they/PRP had/VBD n't/RB presented/JJ it/PRP deconstructed/VBD on/IN such/JJ a/DT large/JJ plate/NN ./.
So/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD hit/VBN and/CC miss/NNS ./.
My/NNP negative/VBD comments/NNS relate/VBP to/TO the/DT service/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD very/RB pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT service/NN until/IN we/PRP finished/VBP dinner/NN and/CC dessert/NN and/CC no/DT one/NN came/VBD around/IN for/IN ages/NNS ./.
Then/IN they/PRP went/VBD to/TO get/VB four/CD bills/NNS and/CC did/VBD come/VB back/RB for/IN another/DT 15/NN mins/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT meantime/NN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO use/VB the/DT washroom/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP saw/VBP there/EX was/VBD no/DT toilet/NN paper/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD back/RB to/TO notify/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT employees/NNS there/RB ./.
She/PRP said/VBD okay/NN ,/, but/CC did/VBD not/RB go/VB to/TO replace/VB the/DT roll/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO borrow/NN wet/NN wipes/NNS from/IN a/DT friend/NN to/TO use/VB their/PRP$ washroom/NN .../: .../: That/DT is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ service/NN ./.
ESP/NNP in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ./.
That/DT is/VBZ n't/RB bustling/VBG with/IN diners/NNS ./.
Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP paid/VBD in/IN cash/NN and/CC it/PRP took/VBD another/DT 15/CD mins/NNS before/IN my/PRP$ change/NN came/VBD around/NN and/CC we/PRP could/MD finally/RB leave/VB ./.
This/DT seems/NN like/IN a/DT nice/JJ place/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP also/RB seems/VBZ like/IN they/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB open/JJ for/IN long/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD okay/NN ,/, the/DT service/NN averages/NNS to/TO okay/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD n't/RB busy/JJ ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ harsh/JJ to/TO say/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC it/PRP definitely/RB does/VBZ n't/RB look/VB like/IN a/DT business/NN that/WDT will/MD last/VB ./.
