It/PRP took/VBD 20/CD min/NN to/TO get/VB seated/VBN in/IN a/DT booth/NN that/WDT was/VBD empty/JJ when/WRB came/JJ in/IN ,/, then/RB once/RB we/PRP ordered/VBP it/PRP took/VBD almost/RB 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
My/NNP Cobb/NNP salad/NN was/VBD not/RB good/JJ ,/, at/IN all/DT ./.
And/CC what/WP I/PRP mean/VBP is/VBZ the/DT lettuce/NN was/VBD limp/NN ,/, slimy/NN and/CC dark/NN ./.
The/DT crispy/NN chicken/NN was/VBD obviously/RB pre-packaged/JJ (/NN Tyson/NN frozen/NN would/MD have/VB tasted/VBN better/JJ )/NN ./.
The/DT blue/JJ cheese/NN dressing/NN was/VBD bland/JJ ./.
My/NNP husband/NN 's/POS pork/NN and/CC wings/NNS combo/NN was/VBD luke/JJ warm/NN ,/, Texas/NNP toast/NN was/VBD hard/RB as/IN a/DT rock/NN and/CC he/PRP ordered/VBD fries/NNS ,/, they/PRP brought/VBD slaw/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP told/VBD our/PRP$ server/NN why/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB eat/VB my/PRP$ salad/NN ,/, she/PRP said/VBD she/PRP would/MD have/VB it/PRP taken/RB off/RB ./.
The/DT manager/NN ,/, Shawn/NNP ,/, came/VBD over/IN ,/, half/DT apologized/JJ and/CC basically/RB called/VBD me/PRP a/DT liar/NN ./.
Said/NNP the/DT lettuce/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC delivered/VBD that/DT day/NN ./.
It/PRP may/MD have/VB been/VBN delivered/VBN today/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP received/VBD it/PRP bad/-NONE- ./.
I/PRP am/VBP a/DT customer/NN service/NN professional/NN ,/, you/PRP never/RB blame/VBD the/DT customer/NN ./.

The/DT iPad/JJ beer/NN menu/NN is/VBZ very/RB clever/JJ &/CC the/DT restaurant/JJ itself/NN is/VBZ not/RB too/RB sports-bar-y/JJ despite/IN all/PDT the/DT TVs/NNP (/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ nice/JJ ./. )/''
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT very/RB yummy/JJ chicken/NN cheesesteak/NN while/IN the/DT hubs/NNS enjoyed/VBD the/DT smokehouse/NN cheesesteak/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB joined/VBD the/DT beer/NN club/NN (/NN although/IN the/DT server/NN did/VBD n't/RB offer/VB it/PRP ,/, we/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB about/IN it/PRP ./. )/''

This/DT is/VBZ my/RB second/JJ visit/NN to/TO a/DT Duckworth/NNP 's/POS and/CC my/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN to/TO this/DT location/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD greeted/VBN and/CC seat/NN with/IN no/DT wait/NN ./.
My/NNP waitress/NN gave/VBD came/VBD out/RP quickly/RB with/IN my/PRP$ drink/NN and/CC gave/VBD me/PRP the/DT right/NN amount/NN of/IN time/NN to/TO look/NN over/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT grilled/JJ shrimp/NN with/IN grilled/JJ veggies/NNS ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN rice/NN and/CC garlic/JJ bread/NN as/IN well/RB ./.
My/NNP meal/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT shrimp/NN were/VBD char-grilled/JJ to/TO perfection/NN ./.
At/IN fist/NN I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG I/PRP would/MD need/VB sauce/JJ but/CC they/PRP were/VBD so/RB flavorful/JJ and/CC moist/JJ they/PRP did/VBD not/RB need/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT veggies/NNS were/VBD well/RB seasoned/VBN and/CC not/RB over/IN cooked/JJ ./.
The/DT rice/NN was/VBD unusual/JJ ./.
It/PRP had/VBD wild/VBN and/CC brown/VBN rice/NN plus/NN veggies/NNS ,/, beans/NNS ,/, and/CC corn/NN with/IN a/DT tasty/NN seasoning/NN ./.
The/DT garlic/NN bread/NN was/VBD light/JJ and/CC crispy/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ pricey/NN but/CC worth/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT waitress/NN made/VBD sure/JJ I/PRP got/VBD out/IN of/IN there/EX quickly/RB since/IN a/DT storm/NN was/VBD coming/VBG ./.
I/PRP would/MD eat/VB here/RB more/RBR often/RB if/IN there/EX was/VBD one/CD in/IN WInston/NNP ./.
;/:
Well/NNP so/RB I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ``/`` Well/NNP done/NNP ''/'' you/PRP have/VBP redeemed/VBN yourself/JJ Duckworth/NNP 's/POS ./.
Even/RB though/IN you/PRP were/VBD very/RB busy/JJ ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD hot/NN and/CC very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO say/VB you/PRP need/VBP to/TO get/VB the/DT ribs/NNS ,/, they/PRP were/VBD falling/RB of/IN the/DT bone/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD terrible/JJ ./.
I/PRP usally/RB like/IN the/DT food/NN but/CC they/PRP brought/VBD out/IN the/DT wrong/JJ food/NN ./.
Then/RB a/DT different/JJ server/NN brought/VBD the/DT correct/NN food/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD half/VBN right/NN ./.
To/TO top/JJ it/PRP off/IN the/DT first/JJ plate/NN that/WDT was/VBD served/VBN was/VBD brought/JJ out/IN to/TO the/DT table/JJ beside/NN us/PRP ./.
And/CC before/IN we/PRP left/VBP another/DT server/NN tried/VBD to/TO bring/VB us/PRP some/DT one/CD elses/NNS food/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN disappeared/VBD for/IN I/PRP dont/VBP know/JJ how/WRB long/JJ ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN ./.
Just/NNP our/NNP speed/VBD ,/, yummy/JJ stepped/VBD up/RP bar/NN food/NN ,/, and/CC lots/NNS of/IN TV/NN 's/POS to/TO watch/NNP sports/NNS ./.
I/PRP enjoy/VBP the/DT beer/NN selection/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB though/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT large/JJ building/NN it/PRP still/RB has/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ atmosphere/NN ./.
You/PRP can/MD always/RB count/VB on/IN a/DT great/JJ meal/NN at/IN Duckworth/NNP 's/POS ./.
The/DT Philly/NNP cheesesteak/NN supreme/NN is/VBZ awesome/NN and/CC so/RB are/VBP the/DT onion/NN rings/NNS and/CC the/DT Philly/NNP cheesesteak/NN pizza/NN ./.
The/DT beer/NN 's/POS on/IN tap/NN selection/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG !/.
The/DT only/JJ negative/NN is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO get/VB a/DT table/NN on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP or/CC Saturday/NNP night/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB long/JJ wait/NN .../:
Food/NNP is/VBZ always/RB served/VBN hot/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP happy/JJ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB open/JJ until/IN 2/CD am/NN again/RB ./.
It/PRP means/VBZ a/DT lot/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO drink/VB good/JJ beer/NN and/CC have/VBP fresh/JJ food/NN late/NN at/IN night/NN ./.
The/DT bartenders/NNS make/VBP this/DT place/NN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
The/DT Chrizo/NNP burger/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC we/PRP are/VBP so/RB happy/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN now/RB ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ paired/VBN with/IN the/DT Birdsong/NNP Jalapeno/NNP beer/NN but/CC they/PRP were/VBD out/RP today/NN ./.
The/DT growler/NN options/NNS and/CC prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ too/RB ./.
The/DT family/NN loves/VBZ coming/VBG here/RB and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT 3rd/CD location/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP visited/VBN in/IN a/DT few/JJ months/NNS ,/, and/CC all/DT were/VBD great/JJ !/.
Ok/NNP ,/, I/PRP reviewed/VBD duckworth/NN 's/POS before/NN but/CC I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO post/VB a/DT review/NN about/IN my/CD visit/NN today/NN ./.
We/PRP always/RB like/IN coming/VBG here/RB but/CC today/NN was/VBD hectic/JJ !/.
The/DT lady/NN at/IN the/DT front/NN was/VBD crazy/JJ and/CC telling/VBG me/PRP that/IN no/DT one/NN was/VBD getting/VBG up/RP to/TO leave/NN so/IN the/DT wait/NN will/MD be/VB long/RB ,/, we/PRP found/VBD a/DT place/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN for/IN dinner/NN and/CC then/RB was/VBD ignored/VBN for/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS by/IN 3/NN bartenders/NNS while/IN they/PRP put/VBD up/RP glasses/NNS and/CC went/VBD to/TO the/DT kitchen/NN ./.
My/NNP dinner/NN was/VBD a/DT 2/CD 1/2/CD out/IN of/IN 5/NN ,/, the/DT lettuce/NN was/VBD wilted/VBN and/CC warm/NN like/IN it/PRP was/VBD sitting/VBG in/IN the/DT hot/NN kitchen/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD mention/NN this/DT to/TO the/DT bartender/NN and/CC she/PRP said/VBD they/PRP keep/VBP the/DT lettuce/NN out/IN while/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ cooking/VBG to/TO finish/VB the/DT entree/NN so/IN that/DT 's/VBZ probably/RB while/IN it/PRP was/VBD warm/NN ./.
My/NNP thoughts/NNS are/VBP it/PRP was/VBD sitting/VBG out/RB longer/JJR than/IN that/DT if/IN it/PRP was/VBD wilted/VBN ./.
Other/JJ than/IN that/DT ,/, it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN only/RB real/JJ mediocre/NN experience/NN here/RB at/IN duckworth/NN 's/POS and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT correct/NN the/DT preparation/NN ./.
Next/NNP time/NN I/PRP 'll/MD probably/RB order/VB something/NN other/JJ than/IN a/DT salad/NN ./.
Beer/NNP selection/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ just/RB OK./NNP Service/NNP each/DT time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN has/VBZ been/VBN pretty/RB mediocre/JJ ./.
Love/NNP this/DT bar/NN !/.
Other/JJ reviews/NNS state/NN that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT loud/JJ bar/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP right/RB ./.
But/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB obnoxious/JJ loud/NN ,/, just/RB people/NNS having/VBP a/DT good/JJ time/NN at/IN a/DT bar/NN loud/NN ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB say/VB that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB family/NN friendly/RB but/CC I/PRP would/MD pick/VB and/CC choose/VB what/WP company/NN to/TO keep/VB when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP here/RB ./.
I/PRP sat/VBP at/IN the/DT bar/NN area/NN and/CC had/VBD the/DT perfect/NN seat/NN with/IN a/DT great/JJ bartender/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP multiple/JJ TVs/NNS above/IN the/DT bar/NN that/IN are/VBP very/RB big/JJ and/CC clear/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ downside/NN is/VBZ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT TV/NN sound/NN so/IN it/PRP takes/VBZ away/RB from/IN the/DT sporting/VBG event/NN being/VBG watched/VBN ./.
Also/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP no/DT purse/NN hooks/VBZ at/IN the/DT bar/NN #/NN thestruggle/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP IPads/NNS for/IN drink/NN menus/NN which/WDT is/VBZ pretty/RB neat/JJ ./.
They/PRP run/VBP a/DT little/NN on/IN the/DT slower/NN side/NN but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT experience/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT ton/NN of/IN beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN of/IN all/DT ranges/NNS ./.
The/DT bartender/NN assisted/VBD a/DT lot/NN with/IN helping/JJ my/NNS small/JJ group/NN find/IN the/DT perfect/NN beers/NNS ./.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD a/DT Sex/NN on/IN the/DT Beach/NNP and/CC a/DT Royal/NNP Flush/NNP shooter/NN ./.
No/DT complaints-/NN made/VBD perfectly/RB ./.
My/NNP bartender/NN was/VBD excellent-/JJ wish/JJ I/PRP got/VBD his/PRP$ name/NN ./.
He/PRP definitely/RB had/VBD a/DT big/JJ hand/NN on/IN the/DT night/NN being/VBG a/DT fun/JJ one/CD with/IN no/DT added/NN stressors/NNS ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ also/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
Our/NNP group/NN munched/VBD and/CC did/VBD n't/RB order/VB any/DT entrees/NNS but/CC I/PRP definitely/RB will/MD be/VB trying/VBG some/DT items/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
The/DT friend/NN pickles/NNS are/VBP delicious/JJ and/CC perfectly/RB seasoned/VBN ./.
Everyone/NNP else/RB had/VBD wings/NNS and/CC destroyed/VBN them/PRP ./.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD the/DT cheesy/NN bacon/NN fries/NNS and/CC they/PRP had/VBD Old/VBN Bay/NNP Seasoning/NNP on/IN them-/JJ delicious/JJ !/.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO hang/VB out/RP with/IN friends/family/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO come/VB ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ ./.
Food/NNP and/CC drinks/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB carpooling/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO come/VB on/IN a/DT weekend/JJ night/NN because/IN parking/NN can/MD be/VB on/IN the/DT ridiculous/JJ side/NN ./.
Just/NNP popped/VBD in/IN to/TO have/VB a/DT burger/NN ./.
Waitress/NNP was/VBD super/JJ nice/NN and/CC the/DT burger/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Nice/NNP selection/NN of/IN beer/NN on/IN tap/NN
Great/NNP food/NN ,/, unfortunately/RB a/DT male/JJ bartender/NN treating/VBG me/PRP as/IN I/PRP was/VBD bothering/VBG him/PRP ./.
How/NNP hard/NNP is/VBZ bar/JJ tending/VBG ?/.
Smile/NNP ,/, serve/JJ me/PRP a/DT cold/NN beverage/NN ,/, and/CC take/VB my/JJ money/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP there/RB to/TO enjoy/VB good/JJ food/NN and/CC cold/NN drink/NN ./.
I/PRP should/MD n't/RB have/VB to/TO deal/NN with/IN bartenders/NNS who/WP have/VBP bad/JJ attitudes/NNS ./.
Our/NNP third/JJ time/NN going/NN ,/, and/CC unfortunately/RB it/PRP feels/VBZ as/IN if/IN each/DT time/NN it/PRP is/VBZ getting/VBG worse/NN and/CC worse/NN ./.
Our/NNP first/JJ time/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, every/DT beer/NN we/PRP asked/VBD for/IN they/PRP had/VBD !/VBN
Specifically/RB a/DT coconut/NN cake/NN beer/NN which/WDT was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
Too/NNP bad/NNP they/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN it/PRP since/IN ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN ,/, my/PRP$ wife/NN and/CC I/PRP brought/VBD a/DT visiting/VBG friend/NN here/RB ./.
And/CC they/PRP really/RB messed/VBD up/RP our/PRP$ order/NN ./.
Brought/NNP out/IN the/DT wrong/JJ appetizer/NN ./.
(/IN Never/NNP bringing/VBG out/IN the/DT right/NN one/CD ,/, just/RB crediting/VBG the/DT mistake/NN )/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN bringing/JJ out/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT wrong/JJ meals/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
Needless/NNP to/TO say/VB our/PRP$ friend/NN was/VBD not/RB very/RB impressed/VBN with/IN our/PRP$ raving/NN review/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP totally/RB understood/VBD ./.
We/PRP went/VBD last/JJ night/NN (/IN Wednesday/NNP )/NNP during/IN the/DT $/$ 3.50/CD draft/CD night/NN ./.
However/RB I/PRP was/VBD asked/VBG to/TO choose/VB a/DT beer/NN 3x/CD because/IN everyone/NN I/PRP chose/VBP from/IN the/DT iPad/NN ,/, the/DT server/NN Hayley/NNP said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD out/RB ./.
Of/IN course/NN this/DT was/VBD over/IN about/IN a/DT 18-20/CD minute/JJ span/JJ because/IN she/PRP had/VBD to/TO keep/VB going/VBG back/RB to/TO the/DT bar/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN service/NN other/JJ tables/NNS ./.
Very/NNP disappointing/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB placed/VBD our/PRP$ order/NN for/IN an/DT appetizer/NN (/NN was/VBD n't/RB asked/JJ about/IN the/DT meal/NN yet/RB because/IN she/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO bring/NN over/IN some/DT sheet/NN about/IN a/DT brisket/JJ burger/NN ,/, that/DT was/VBD never/RB brought/VBN over/IN )/NNS ./.
Well/NNP our/VBD appetizer/NN (/NN mozzarella/NN and/CC tomato/NN salad/JJ )/NN was/VBD brought/JJ out/NN ,/, and/CC finished/VBD before/IN we/PRP even/RB ordered/VBN dinner/NN !/.
During/VBG this/DT time/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD finished/VBN the/DT first/JJ beer/NN and/CC was/VBD waiting/VBG and/CC waiting/VBG and/CC waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT second/JJ one/CD ./.
The/DT part/NN that/IN really/RB set/VBN us/PRP back/RB ,/, could/MD of/IN been/VBN our/NN fault/NN ,/, however/RB it/PRP would/MD of/IN been/VBN a/DT nice/JJ gesture/NN from/IN the/DT waitress/NN to/TO inform/NN us/PRP .../: My/NNP wife/NNP ordered/VBD a/DT beer/NN she/PRP thought/VBD looked/VBN interesting/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT wild/JJ berry/NN beer/NN called/VBN ciasco/NN ./.
The/DT beer/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, however/RB it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN in/IN a/DT 750ml/CD bottle/NN aka/NN $/$ 24/CD ,/, not/RB $/$ 3.50/CD ./.
So/IN we/PRP were/VBD very/RB set/VBN back/RB by/IN it/PRP especially/RB since/IN we/PRP were/VBD wrapping/VBG up/RP dinner/NN ./.
Now/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT huge/JJ bottle/NN of/IN beer/NN to/TO drink/VB before/IN leaving/NN since/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO waste/VB it/PRP ./.
When/WRB you/PRP first/RB come/VBP across/IN the/DT beer/NN on/IN the/DT iPad/JJ the/DT price/NN is/VBZ not/RB shown/NN ./.
You/PRP have/VBP to/TO actually/RB tap/VB on/IN the/DT bee/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT description/NN of/IN it/PRP that/IN shows/VBZ the/DT price/NN ./.
Again/NNP ,/, obviously/RB our/VBN fault/NN for/IN not/RB tapping/VBG on/IN the/DT beer-/JJ however/NN when/WRB you/PRP assume/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ $/$ 3.50/CD beer/NN not/RB ,/, why/RB check/NN ?/.
The/DT manager/NN came/VBD over/IN and/CC asked/VBD how/WRB the/DT meal/NN was/VBD (/VBN just/RB like/IN they/PRP do/VBP in/IN all/DT restaurants/NNS )/NNS ./.
He/PRP needs/VBD to/TO roll/VB up/RP his/PRP$ sleeves/NNS and/CC help/VB his/PRP$ staff/NN though/IN ./.
When/WRB he/PRP came/VBD over/IN ,/, both/DT my/NNS wife/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD two/CD empty/JJ beer/NN glasses/NNS ./.
Should/NNP of/IN asked/NNP if/IN we/PRP needed/VBP anything/NN or/CC wanted/VB another/DT drink/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ ./.
We/PRP 've/VBP ordered/VBN something/NN different/JJ every/DT time/NN and/CC have/VBP loved/VBN it/PRP ./.
This/DT time/NN we/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT smoked/JJ brisket/NN tacos/NNS ,/, bbq/NN chicken/NN platter/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN dessert/VB the/DT coconut/NN cake/NN and/CC chocolate/NN cake/NN ./.
All/DT very/RB very/RB tasty/JJ !/.
I/PRP did/VBD notice/RB from/IN last/JJ time/NN and/CC this/DT time/NN ,/, the/DT portions/NNS for/IN dinner/NN are/VBP insanely/RB different/JJ ./.
My/NNP bbq/VBD chicken/VBN came/VBD with/IN a/DT decent/JJ size/NN breast/NN ,/, a/DT ton/NN of/IN fries/NNS ,/, onion/NN rings/NNS and/CC two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN bread/JJ ./.
The/DT brisket/NN tacos/VBZ my/PRP$ wife/NN ordered/NNS were/VBD much/RB smaller/JJR ./.
2/CD tacos/NNS with/IN a/DT handful/NN of/IN tortilla/NN chips/NNS ./.
So/RB make/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP ask/VBP about/IN the/DT portions/NNS ,/, or/CC just/RB stick/JJ to/TO the/DT platters/NNS if/IN you/PRP want/VBP your/JJ money/NN 's/POS worth/NN ./.
In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, this/DT will/MD not/RB be/VB our/JJ go/NN to/TO anymore/VB ,/, as/IN the/DT experiences/NNS keep/VBP getting/VBG worse/NN ,/, and/CC ``/`` all/DT of/IN the/DT beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN ''/'' is/VBZ very/RB misleading/JJ ,/, since/IN they/PRP usually/RB do/VBP n't/RB have/VB them/PRP all/DT It/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB bad/JJ because/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ so/RB tasty/JJ ./.
Beer/NNP selection/NN is/VBZ great/JJ if/IN you/PRP can/MD get/VB one/CD ,/, (/IN the/DT service/NN for/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ of/IN 12/CD was/VBD horrendous/JJ )/NNP &/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ decent/JJ ,/, though/IN came/VBD out/RP sporadically/RB over/IN a/DT 45/NN minute/NN wait/JJ time/NN ,/, &/CC mostly/RB under/IN par/NN quality/NN ,/, even/RB for/IN fried/VBN bar/NN food/NN ./.
We/PRP arrived/VBD around/IN 3/NNP pm/NN ,/, a/DT time/NN when/WRB there/NNS were/VBD more/RBR servers/NNS than/IN patrons/NNS ,/, yet/RB we/PRP still/RB could/MD n't/RB get/VB decent/JJ service/NN ./.
Never/NNP again/RB ,/, as/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ over/IN rated/VBN ./.
Had/NNP a/DT great/JJ experience/NN in/IN the/DT Huntersville/NNP Duckworth/NNP 's/POS -/JJ kudos/NNS to/TO the/DT manager/NN -Shawn/NN !/.

Not/RB enough/RB staff/VBN to/TO handle/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN customers/NNS ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN a/DT table/JJ for/IN 2/CD in/IN a/DT Monday/NNP night/NN at/IN 8pm/CD ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB like/IN there/EX are/VBP 0/-NONE- restaurants/NNS around/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB that/IN new/JJ I/PRP assume/NN ./.
Come/NNP here/RB for/IN the/DT craft/NN beer/NN ,/, but/CC dine/VB somewhere/RB else/RB
After/IN an/DT extremely/JJ disappointing/NN lunch/NN at/IN Fox/NNP and/CC Hound/NNP last/JJ Sunday/NNP this/DT week/NN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB out/RP Duckworths/NNP Huntersville/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB worth/JJ driving/VBG the/DT two/CD exits/NNS up/IN (/NN or/CC down/IN )/CD I/PRP feel/VBP the/DT need/NN to/TO disclaim/VB that/IN I/PRP was/VBD a/DT server/bartender/NN for/IN 10/CD years/NNS so/IN some/DT things/NNS I/PRP find/VBP important/JJ in/IN a/DT restaurant/JJ experience/NN others/NNS may/MD not/RB ./.
First/NNP off/VBD the/DT hostess/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC upbeat/NN and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB to/TO wait/NN at/IN all/DT even/RB though/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD busy/NN ./.

Then/RB we/PRP got/VBD our/PRP$ wings/NNS which/WDT were/VBD great/JJ but/CC apparently/RB the/DT pizza/NN needed/VBD a/DT little/JJ more/RBR time/NN (/IN we/PRP had/VBD n't/RB even/RB noticed/VBN it/PRP was/VBD running/VBG behind/NN because/IN apparently/NNS that/WDT 's/POS how/WRB good/JJ the/DT standards/NNS are/VBP here/RB )/JJ so/IN the/DT manager/NN comes/VBZ over/IN to/TO apologize/VB and/CC takes/VBZ the/DT pizza/NN off/IN the/DT bill/NN for/IN our/PRP$ wait/NN !/NN !/.
She/PRP felt/VBD bad/JJ because/IN the/DT pizza/NN was/VBD for/IN our/PRP$ young/JJ son/NN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD very/RB sweet/JJ ./.
We/PRP literally/RB waited/VBD 25/CD minutes/NNS for/IN side/NN salads/NNS at/IN Fox/NNP and/CC Hound/NNP the/DT previous/JJ week/NN and/CC had/VBD to/TO track/NN down/IN someone/NN to/TO get/VB them/PRP for/IN us/PRP !/.

We/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN there/RB about/IN 5/CD times/NNS in/IN the/DT last/JJ 3/CD months/NNS and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB a/DT treat/NN ./.

The/DT Chicken/NNP fajita/NN was/VBD a/DT tad/JJ too/NN spicy/NN for/IN me/PRP but/CC you/PRP get/VBP plenty/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
What/WP I/PRP especially/VBP like/IN about/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT consistent/NN good/JJ score/NN from/IN the/DT Health/NNP Department/NNP or/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB there/RB ./.
That/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP look/VBP for/IN when/WRB going/VBG in/IN ANY/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
If/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ lower/JJR than/IN 95.0/CD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ bye/JJ bye/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
This/DT place/NN does/VBZ good/JJ business/NN and/CC the/DT workers/NNS are/VBP constantly/RB flying/VBG by/IN !/.
They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB just/RB stand/VB around/IN like/IN they/PRP do/VBP at/IN some/DT places/NNS !/.
Well/NNP I/PRP was/VBD really/RB looking/JJ forward/NN to/TO eating/JJ and/CC drinking/VBG here/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT large/JJ menu/NN and/CC beer/NN selection/NN ./.
The/DT beers/NNS and/CC the/DT selection/NN were/VBD great/JJ but/CC the/DT dining/NN left/VBD a/DT lot/NN to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD awful/JJ ./.
The/DT fried/JJ pickles/NNS were/VBD the/DT saltiest/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD and/CC they/PRP give/VBP u/RB a/DT side/NN of/IN ranch/NN without/IN even/RB taking/VBG the/DT lid/NN off/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT tap/NN house/NN ./.
The/DT flatbread/NN was/VBD good/JJ except/NN for/IN the/DT fact/NN they/PRP forgot/VBP to/TO add/VB the/DT jalapeño/NN bacon/NN which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP gives/VBZ that/IN flatbread/JJ its/PRP$ name/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
The/DT philly/NN was/VBD nothing/JJ special/NN ,/, just/RB ok./JJ Needless/NN to/TO say/VB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ about/IN average/JJ to/TO over/IN priced/NNS and/CC not/RB worth/VB going/JJ back/NNS ./.
If/IN u/JJ want/NN to/TO watch/VB a/DT game/NN and/CC drink/NN beers/NNS then/RB this/DT is/VBZ your/VBG place/NN ./.
What/WP a/DT terrific/JJ bar/NN !/.
With/IN 112/CD beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO go/VB wrong/JJ ./.
We/PRP just/RB happened/VBD to/TO walk/NN in/IN on/IN a/DT Wednesday/NNP night/NN when/WRB all/DT drafts/NNS were/VBD $/$ 3.50/CD !/.
Dangerous/NNP ,/, huh/NN ?/.
The/DT bartenders/NNS will/MD let/VB you/PRP sample/VB anything/NN until/IN you/PRP find/VBP what/WP you/PRP like/IN ./.
Really/RB great/JJ atmosphere/RB with/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN open/JJ air/NN seating/VBG in/IN screened/JJ in/IN areas/NNS plus/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ bar/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB had/VBD tablets/NNS all/DT over/IN the/DT bar/NN highlighting/VBG their/PRP$ extensive/JJ draft/NN list/NN ./.
You/PRP can/MD even/RB choose/VB favorites/NNS &/CC email/NN them/PRP to/TO yourself/NN ./.
After/IN a/DT long/JJ night/NN of/IN $/$ 3.50/CD drafts/NNS ,/, one/CD could/MD see/VB how/WRB you/PRP might/MD forget/VB a/DT thing/NN or/CC 2/CD !/.
Food/NNP ?/.
Let/NNP 's/POS start/NN with/IN the/DT jalapeño/NN bacon/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ on/IN or/CC can/MD be/VB added/VBN to/TO just/RB about/IN anything/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ as/RB good/JJ as/IN it/PRP sounds/VBZ !/.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT bacon/NN on/IN a/DT chicken/NN club/NN &/CC hubby/JJ got/NNS it/PRP on/IN a/DT Philly/NNP Cheese/NNP Steak/NNP ./.
They/PRP actually/RB had/VBD several/JJ Philly/RB options/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, which/WDT made/VBN my/JJ guy/NN happy/NN ./.

We/PRP met/VBP the/DT manager/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN &/CC begged/VBD him/PRP to/TO open/VB a/DT Pittsburgh/NNP location/NN ./.
He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP 's/VBZ concentrating/VBG in/IN Charlotte/NNP for/IN now/RB ./.

Considering/NNP it/PRP was/VBD crowded/VBN ,/, seems/VBZ like/IN people/NNS know/VBP a/DT good/JJ thing/NN when/WRB they/PRP see/VBP it/PRP ./.
We/PRP stopped/VBD here/RB tonite/VBP for/IN a/DT pint/NN and/CC appetizers/NNS ./.
Excellent/NNP beer/NN Selection/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP can/MD even/RB get/VB a/DT flight/NN sampler/NN ./.
iPads/NNS on/IN the/DT table/JJ with/IN beer/NN selections/NNS that/WDT you/PRP can/MD email/VB to/TO yourself/NN for/IN later/JJ ./.
Awesome/NNP place/NNP !/.
Great/NNP philly/RB cheesesteak/NN and/CC lots/NNS of/IN options/NN
Maybe/NNP she/PRP was/VBD tired/VBN but/CC it/PRP makes/VBZ me/PRP not/RB want/VBP to/TO frequent/VB the/DT place/NN ./.
This/DT bartender/NN had/VBD very/RB short/JJ blonde/NN hair/NN and/CC no/DT personality/NN ./.
Having/VBG worked/NNS in/IN the/DT industry/NN myself/NN I/PRP would/MD have/VB called/VBN off/RP work/NN if/IN I/PRP thought/VBP my/JJ mood/NN was/VBD going/VBG to/TO effect/NN my/NNS customers/NNS experience/NN ./.
I/PRP probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/JJ but/CC if/IN I/PRP do/VBP ,/, I/PRP will/MD refuse/VB to/TO order/NN from/IN her/PRP !/.
Best/NNP watering/NN hole/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
100+/CD craft/NN beers/NNS on/IN draught/NN with/IN frequent/JJ rotation/NN ./.
Charles/IN the/DT beer/NN sommelier/NN is/VBZ superb/NN ./.

Have/NNP n't/RB tried/VBD anything/NN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB liked/VBN ./.
Service/NNP has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN great/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
5/NN stars/NNS all/DT around/IN !/.
To/TO me/PRP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD just/RB your/JJ average/NN sports/NNS type/NN pub/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD n't/RB great/JJ (/NN Philly/RB cheese/JJ steak/NN was/VBD lacking/VBG in/IN taste/JJ )/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD ok/JJ ./.
Probably/RB would/MD skip/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
Something/NNP has/VBZ changed/VBN ./.
The/DT food/NN has/VBZ absolutely/RB gone/NN to/TO shit/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT good/JJ wait/NN staff/NN has/VBZ disappeared/VBN ./.
We/PRP normally/RB ate/VBP here/RB at/IN least/JJS once/RB a/DT week/NN ./.
Started/NNP noticing/VBG a/DT decline/NN in/IN quality/NN ./.
Thought/NNP we/PRP 'd/MD give/VB it/PRP a/DT break/NN a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN but/CC decided/VBD to/TO go/VB today/NN before/IN the/DT circus/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD great/JJ while/IN it/PRP lasted/VBD but/CC we/PRP wont/VBP waste/VB the/DT time/NN or/CC money/NN here/RB again/RB ./.
./.
The/DT side/NN of/IN garlic/JJ fries/NNS are/VBP great/JJ and/CC would/MD recommend/VB getting/RB those/DT as/RB well/RB ./.

Duckworths/NNP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ local/JJ spot/NN ,/, although/IN they/PRP are/VBP beginning/VBG to/TO go/VB more/JJR corporate/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ super/NN spotty/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ usually/RB consistent/NN ./.
Hopefully/RB this/DT wo/MD n't/RB change/VB as/IN they/PRP begin/VBP to/TO go/VB more/JJR corporate/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ expensive/JJ ./.
Besides/NNP Bad/NNP Daddy/NNP 's/POS ,/, probably/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS expensive/JJ sandwich/burger/JJ places/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
A/DT Philly/NNP cheesesteak/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ specialties/NNS ,/, will/MD run/VB you/PRP about/IN fifteen/VBN bucks/NNS ./.
Not/RB overly/RB huge/JJ or/CC anything/NN either/NN ./.
The/DT burger/NN lunch/NN special/VBD that/IN they/PRP have/VBP on/IN some/DT days/NNS is/VBZ eight/JJ bucks/NNS for/IN a/DT burger/NN ,/, fries/NNS and/CC a/DT drink/NN ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT deal/NN but/CC otherwise/NN ,/, even/RB a/DT Cobb/NN salad/NN will/MD run/VB you/PRP around/IN fifteen/VBN bucks/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO go/VB is/VBZ by/IN getting/VBG their/PRP$ fajita/NN chicken/NN nachos/NNS ./.
These/DT are/VBP around/IN $/$ 16/CD but/CC they/PRP are/VBP a/DT really/RB big/JJ portion/NN ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP go/JJ and/CC split/VB them/PRP with/IN one/CD other/JJ person/NN and/CC have/VBP it/PRP as/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
It/PRP 'd/MD be/VB ridiculous/JJ to/TO have/VB it/PRP as/IN an/DT appetizer/NN unless/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT large/JJ group/NN of/IN people/NNS ./.
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB like/IN being/VBG charged/VBN extra/NN for/IN salsa/NN ,/, that/IN should/MD just/RB come/VB with/IN it/PRP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT good/JJ ,/, local/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT usually/RB has/VBZ pretty/RB consistently/RB good/JJ food/NN ./.
Surprisingly/RB ,/, their/PRP$ fajitas/NNS are/VBP good/JJ too/RB ./.
Just/NNP expect/VBD to/TO be/VB spending/VBN a/DT pretty/RB penny/JJ on/IN rather/RB ordinary/JJ food/NN ,/, although/IN it/PRP tastes/VBZ good/JJ ./.
Mediocre/NNP food/NN and/CC extremely/RB slow/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN this/DT place/NN has/VBZ going/VBN for/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT great/JJ craft/NN beer/NN selection/NN with/IN tons/NNS of/IN tvs/NNS but/CC with/IN 4/CD breweries/NNS within/IN 5/JJ minutes/NNS of/IN here/RB I/PRP will/MD go/VB elsewhere/RB

It/PRP is/VBZ large/JJ inside/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT mass/NN amount/NN of/IN tv/NN 's/POS -/JJ great/NN because/IN we/PRP love/VBP watching/VBG a/DT bunch/NN of/IN games/NNS !/.

This/DT is/VBZ my/RB 5th/JJ time/NN to/TO Duckworth/NNP 's/POS ,/, first/JJ time/NN at/IN the/DT Huntersville/NNP location/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD fabulous/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD spot/NN on/IN ./.

Absolutely/RB the/DT best/JJS !/.

And/CC the/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ still/RB cool/NN and/CC comfortable/JJ with/IN spacious/JJ dining/JJ area/NN and/CC bar/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, is/VBZ still/RB average/JJ ./.
All/DT of/IN the/DT following/VBG food/NN for/IN the/DT three/CD people/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ party/NN was/VBD classified/VBN as/IN average/NN :/: two/CD salads/NNS ,/, cheeseburger/NN ,/, pizza/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD barely/RB average/JJ ./.
Definitely/RB a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO go/VB for/IN a/DT beer/NN and/CC watch/VBD a/DT game/NN ,/, or/CC to/TO get/VB out/RP with/IN the/DT family/NN for/IN an/DT affordable/JJ meal/NN ./.

The/DT server/NN I/PRP had/VBD seemed/VBN a/DT little/JJ pre-occupied/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT group/NN of/IN 3/NN of/IN us/PRP and/CC our/PRP$ drinks/NNS stayed/VBD empty/NN before/IN she/PRP would/MD come/VB back/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD later/JJ ,/, about/IN midnight/NN so/IN the/DT store/NN was/VBD n't/RB packed/VBN ./.
She/PRP took/VBD our/PRP$ order/NN and/CC did/VBD n't/RB come/VB back/RB until/IN after/IN our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD brought/VBN out/RP by/IN someone/NN else/RB ./.

Then/RB another/DT 5/NN minutes/VBZ passed/NNS and/CC she/PRP finally/RB brought/VBD our/PRP$ checks/NNS ./.
The/DT dining/NN experience/NN was/VBD not/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ as/IN always/RB though/IN !/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD a/DT bad/JJ time/NN at/IN any/DT Duckworth/NNP 's/POS ./.
This/DT location/NN is/VBZ no/DT different/NN ./.
Huge/NNP selection/NN of/IN beers/NNS and/CC really/RB a/DT beer/NN nerd/NN haven/NN ./.
The/DT bar/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB large/JJ here/RB so/RB finding/VBG a/DT seat/NN should/MD n't/RB be/VB a/DT terrible/JJ problem/NN unless/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ game/JJ day/NN I/PRP would/MD assume/VB ./.
The/DT bar/NN service/NN was/VBD quick/JJ for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN and/CC our/PRP$ drinks/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD there/RB on/IN a/DT pretty/NN busy/NN Saturday/NNP night/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD the/DT steak/JJ salad/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN it/PRP before/IN at/IN other/JJ locations/NNS and/CC here/RB it/PRP was/VBD just/RB as/IN delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT highlight/NN of/IN my/PRP$ night/NN were/VBD the/DT specialty/NN rare/NN beers/VBZ they/PRP had/VBD on/IN tap/NN which/WDT tells/NNS me/VBP their/PRP$ beer/NN manager/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG a/DT great/JJ job/NN ./.
We/PRP just/RB went/VBD to/TO Duckworths/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN Huntersville/NNP North/NNP Carolina/NNP ./.
I/PRP really/VBP enjoyed/VBN the/DT beer/NN list/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD very/RB unique/JJ beers/NNS all/DT around/IN the/DT country/NN can/MD not/RB find/VB any/DT places/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB crowded/JJ so/IN I/PRP recommend/VBP going/VBG on/IN a/DT weeknight/NN or/CC very/RB early/JJ on/IN the/DT weekend/NN ./.
Despite/IN the/DT crowds/NNS our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ and/CC we/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ experience/NN ./.
Unusual/NN for/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
This/DT time/NN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT terrible/JJ experience/NN ./.
Sat/NNP down/VBD with/IN a/DT table/JJ of/IN 10/CD at/IN 7:00/CD ./.
Half/NNP the/DT party/NN was/VBD served/VBN at/IN 8:00/CD ./.
The/DT other/JJ half/NN did/VBD n't/RB get/VB food/NN till/NN 8:20/CD ./.
When/WRB we/PRP finally/RB got/VBD the/DT food/NN ,/, we/PRP got/VBD the/DT wrong/JJ sides/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB bad/JJ because/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT wait/NN staff/NN was/VBD trying/VBG ./.
It/PRP appeared/VBD that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD understaffed/JJ and/CC completely/RB disorganized/VBD ./.
This/DT one/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT management/NN ./.
Too/NNP bad/NNP .../:

I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB 2/JJ hours/NNS for/IN nachos/NNS and/CC a/DT pizza/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ridiculous/JJ ./.
They/PRP brought/VBD out/IN the/DT nachos/NNS with/IN no/DT buffalo/NN sauce/NN and/CC when/WRB I/PRP mentioned/VBD it/PRP they/PRP brought/VBD out/RP a/DT bowl/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO pour/VB over/IN it/PRP ?/. ?/.
The/DT pizza/NN came/VBD out/RP with/IN chicken/NN on/IN it/PRP and/CC I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN no/DT chicken/NN bc/NN were/VBD vegetarian/JJ ./.
Waited/NNP 30/CD min/NN for/IN another/DT one/CD ./.

Food/NNP was/VBD ok./JJ We/PRP had/VBD Carolina/VBN BBQ/NNP sandwich/NN and/CC grilled/VBD salmon/NN ./.
You/PRP might/MD need/VB to/TO skip/NN this/DT but/CC relaxing/VBG with/IN awesome/JJ drinks/NNS instead/RB ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ clean/JJ ./.
Good/NNP for/IN family/NN and/CC friends/VBZ just/RB to/TO have/VB a/DT chill/NN night/NN out/IN ./.

Drink/NNP more/RBR beer/JJ here/RB !/.
Great/NNP eclectic/JJ mix/NN of/IN beers/NNS in/IN draft/NN and/CC the/DT beer/NN club/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
You/PRP get/VBP an/DT iPad/NN to/TO read/VB up/RP on/IN you/PRP suds/NNS of/IN choice/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN different/JJ fare/JJ here/NN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP good/JJ ./.

!/NN
This/DT was/VBD close/JJ to/TO hotel/NN and/CC had/VBD good/JJ reviews/NNS so/IN I/PRP though/IN I/PRP would/MD try/VB ./.
I/PRP sat/VBP at/IN bar/NN and/CC drink/NN water/NN but/CC if/IN you/PRP like/VBP beer/NN they/PRP have/VBP more/JJR than/IN a/DT few/JJ to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT brisket/JJ tacos/NNS ./.
Not/RB comparing/VBG brisket/NN to/TO that/DT cooked/JJ in/IN Texas/NNP it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
You/PRP know/VBP if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP famous/JJ for/IN that/DT food/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ for/IN somebody/NN to/TO out/VB do/IN you/PRP states/VB away/RB ./.
Regardless/JJ the/DT brisket/NN tacos/NNS was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
Staff/NNP was/VBD also/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ stumble/JJ I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD ,/, I/PRP was/VBD wanting/VBG something/NN sweet/NN to/TO take/VB with/IN me/PRP ./.
So/IN I/PRP decided/VBD on/IN the/DT cupcake/NN sampler/NN ./.
4/RB different/JJ type/NN cupcakes/NNS ./.
This/DT way/NN if/IN their/PRP$ is/VBZ one/CD I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/IN I/PRP can/MD just/RB try/VB another/DT one/CD ./.
I/PRP noticed/VBD when/WRB the/DT bartender/NN handed/VBD them/PRP to/TO me/VB the/DT bag/NN was/VBD cold/NN ./.
Ok/IN I/PRP though/VBP ./.
Went/NNP back/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ hotel/NN room/NN ./.
Opens/IN the/DT back/NN and/CC the/DT plastic/JJ carrier/NN they/PRP were/VBD in/IN and/CC bit/NN into/IN a/DT really/JJ cold/NN cupcake/NN that/WDT was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ sticky/NN ./.
Like/IN almost/RB slimey/NN sticky/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB the/DT restaurant/NN but/CC not/RB the/DT cupcakes/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP cupcake/JJ they/PRP have/VBP better/VBN and/CC cheeper/NN ones/NNS at/IN the/DT grocery/NN store/NN ./.
I/PRP almost/RB gave/VBD 3/RB stars/NNS but/CC most/RBS people/NNS go/VBP to/TO drink/VB and/CC eat/VB ./.
So/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP letting/VBG them/PRP slide/NN on/IN the/DT strange/NN and/CC not/RB good/JJ dessert/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB for/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ time/NN tonight/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB a/DT nice/NN restaurant/NN come/NN in/IN after/IN O'Charleys/NNP ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ nice-/JJ half/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ bar/NN themed/VBN and/CC the/DT other/JJ half/NN a/DT dining/NN room/NN which/WDT seemed/-NONE- to/TO be/VB sectioned/VBN off/RP very/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT drafts/NNS for/IN each/DT table/JJ in/IN the/DT bar/NN area/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP more/JJR TVs/NNS that/IN you/PRP can/MD even/RB look/VB at/IN !/.
I/PRP sat/VBP in/IN the/DT dining/JJ room/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC polite/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP could/MD not/RB understand/VB what/WP he/PRP said/VBD no/DT matter/NN how/WRB many/JJ times/NNS we/PRP asked/VBD him/PRP to/TO repeat/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Baja/NNP tacos/NNS which/WDT were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ spicy/NN but/CC delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN I/PRP only/RB got/VBD two/CD tacos/NNS and/CC my/PRP$ brother/NN got/VBD the/DT Philly/NNP cheesesteak/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ price/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT MUCH/NNP better/NN value/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP nothing/VBN but/CC good/JJ things/NN to/TO say/VB about/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD most/VB definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB was/VBD that/IN there/NNS were/VBD two/CD managers/NNS that/IN stopped/JJ two/CD times/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT serve/NN that/IN stopped/NN to/TO ask/VB how/WRB everything/NN was/VBD ./.
It/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ to/TO see/VB as/IN a/DT patron/NN that/IN the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ really/RB ensuring/VBG a/DT quality/NN experience/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP think/RB this/DT was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ overboard/NN and/CC took/VBD away/RB from/IN dinner/NN conversation/NN with/IN my/NNP family/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, I/PRP heard/VBD the/DT manager/NN apologizing/VBG to/TO a/DT table/JJ behind/NN us/PRP and/CC in/IN doing/NN so/IN he/PRP bad/VBZ mouthed/JJ one/CD of/IN the/DT employees/NNS which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD really/RB Unprofessional/JJ and/CC tacky/JJ ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, 4/5/CD stars/NNS ./.

Food/NNP is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ for/IN bar/NN food/NN ,/, but/CC nothing/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP sampled/VBN is/VBZ stellar/JJ ./.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP an/DT impressive/JJ beer/NN selection/NN ./.
Lots/NNS and/CC lots/NNS of/IN tv/NN 's/POS as/IN one/CD would/MD expect/VB so/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG to/TO see/VB an/DT obscure/NN game/NN ,/, they/PRP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO accommodate/VB you/PRP ./.
We/PRP have/VBP pretty/RB much/JJ ruled/VBN this/DT place/NN out/IN because/IN of/IN the/DT noise/NN level/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP know/VBP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT sports/NN bar/NN ./.
But/CC this/DT is/VBZ my/VBG review/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT fair/NN comment/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP to/TO converse/VB with/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN during/IN dinner/NN and/CC I/PRP find/VBP hearing/JJ very/RB difficult/JJ at/IN Duckworth/NNP 's/POS ./.

The/DT waitress/NN avoided/VBD us/PRP entirely/RB ./.

Had/IN the/DT manager/NN not/RB been/VBN rude/NN and/CC had/VBD chosen/VBN kindness/NN instead/RB ,/, we/PRP would/MD 've/VB been/VBN satisfied/JJ ./.

On/IN a/DT positive/JJ note/NN ,/, our/PRP$ server/NN Ann/NNP Marie/NNP did/VBD a/DT great/JJ job/NN ./.

Food/NNP is/VBZ drenched/VBN in/IN sauces/NNS and/CC smell/NN permissible/JJ when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ served/VBN hot/NN ./.
But/CC once/RB the/DT food/NN cools/VBZ down/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD smell/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ spoiled/VBN or/CC close/JJ to/TO being/VBG spoiled/VBN ./.
And/CC as/IN mentioned/VBN ,/, this/DT more/NN of/IN a/DT sports/NNS bar/NN ;/: place/NN is/VBZ loud/VBN to/TO make/VB you/PRP drink/VB more/JJR and/CC there/EX are/VBP way/NN too/RB many/JJ TVs/NNS to/TO zombify/VB you/PRP while/IN having/NN your/NN food/NN and/CC drink/NN so/RB that/IN you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB notice/VB that/IN the/DT food/NN are/VBP barely/RB edible/JJ without/IN the/DT sauces/NNS ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN three/CD stars/NNS because/IN the/DT manager/NN actually/RB stepped/VBD up/RP but/CC we/PRP still/RB left/VBN frustrated/VBN ./.
We/PRP show/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT party/NN of/IN 9/NN that/IN includes/JJ three/CD small/JJ children/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD told/VBN 30-35/JJ minutes/NNS before/IN we/PRP could/MD get/VB a/DT table/JJ ./.
After/IN 45/CD minutes/NNS we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN the/DT table/JJ was/VBD not/RB ready/NN ./.
As/IN we/PRP crossed/VBD the/DT hour/NN mark/NN and/CC just/RB prior/RB to/TO us/PRP leaving/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN our/PRP$ table/JJ was/VBD ready/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD taken/VBN to/TO back/RB to/TO back/RB booths/NNS ,/, not/RB a/DT table/JJ ./.
This/DT could/MD have/VB been/VBN done/VBN 30/CD mins/NNS prior/RB and/CC we/PRP stated/VBD that/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO eat/VB together/NN at/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
We/PRP suggested/VBD moving/VBG a/DT table/JJ up/NN against/IN the/DT booth/NN and/CC this/DT worked/NN ./.
After/IN asking/NN for/IN the/DT manager/NN ,/, he/PRP came/VBD and/CC gave/VBD us/PRP two/CD free/JJ appetizers/NNS but/CC the/DT frustrating/NN part/NN is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP have/VBP no/DT problem/NN paying/NN for/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD rather/RB have/VB someone/VBN tell/NN me/NNS that/WDT Friday/NNP night/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT great/JJ time/NN for/IN parties/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB come/VBN back/RB another/DT time/NN or/CC expect/VB the/DT team/NN working/VBG the/DT front/NN to/TO provide/VB accurate/JJ wait/NN times/NNS ./.
If/IN that/DT amount/NN is/VBZ exceeded/JJ ,/, then/RB a/DT simple/JJ walk/NN outside/NN to/TO inform/NN us/PRP that/IN existing/VBG customers/NNS are/VBP spending/VBG more/RBR time/NN than/IN expected/NN is/VBZ not/RB too/RB much/RB to/TO ask/NN ./.
At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, we/PRP could/MD make/VB a/DT decision/NN about/IN staying/JJ or/CC not/RB ./.
So/RB ,/, we/PRP sit/VBP down/RP at/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ slightly/NN aggravated/VBD because/IN of/IN the/DT experience/NN up/RB to/TO this/DT point/NN ./.
The/DT beer/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT large/JJ selection/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN a/DT philly/RB cheese/JJ steak/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Due/NNP to/TO the/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN customers/NNS I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB put/VB that/IN much/JJ fault/NN on/IN our/PRP$ server/NN because/IN I/PRP could/MD see/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD busy/NN ./.
What/WP I/PRP will/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN most/JJS restaurants/NNS that/WDT work/NN well/RB have/VBP a/DT runner/NN that/WDT can/MD assist/VB with/IN drinks/NNS refills/NNS and/CC plate/NN removal/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB took/VBD an/DT unreasonable/JJ amount/NN of/IN time/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
We/PRP all/VBP had/VBD sandwiches/salads/NNS so/IN it/PRP should/MD n't/RB have/VB taken/VBN as/RB long/JJ as/IN it/PRP did/VBD ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT experience/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN different/JJ if/IN we/PRP were/VBD a/DT group/NN of/IN four/CD but/CC I/PRP would/MD appreciate/VB an/DT upfront/JJ notification/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO handle/VB a/DT large/JJ group/NN rather/RB than/IN try/CD to/TO accommodate/VB and/CC fail/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB saying/VBG that/IN I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB return/VB to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN (/NN I/PRP was/VBD really/RB excited/VBN about/IN the/DT beer/NN club/NN )/IN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP know/RB of/IN other/JJ area/NN restaurants/NNS that/WDT have/VBP given/VBN me/PRP and/CC my/NNP family/NN a/DT better/JJR dining/NN experience/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP chose/VBP to/TO dine/VB at/IN Duckworth/NNP 's/POS Grill/NNP &/CC Taphouse/NNP by/IN recommendation/NN from/IN a/DT friend/NN of/IN ours/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD around/IN 7pm/CD on/IN Thursday/NNP evening/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD very/RB busy/JJ which/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ sign/NN and/CC we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO sit/NN in/IN the/DT Bar/NNP area/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD Kelli/NNP who/WP later/JJ let/NN us/PRP know/VB it/PRP was/VBD her/PRP first/JJ night/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ordered/VBD the/DT House/NNP Pinot/NNP Noir/NNP wine/NN with/IN her/PRP grilled/VBD Salmon/NNP and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP an/DT Allagash/NNP White/NNP Draft/NNP Beer/NNP along/NN with/IN the/DT Buffalo/NNP Chicken/NNP Pizza/NNP ./.
Everything/NN came/VBD out/RP in/IN a/DT timely/RB manner/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD overly/RB satisfied/VBN with/IN the/DT quality/NN and/CC value/NN of/IN everything/NN we/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
Kelli/NNP made/VBD the/DT dining/JJ experience/NN fun/NN and/CC relaxing/NN and/CC she/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB working/JJ there/NN ./.
We/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB and/CC recommend/NN to/TO all/DT that/NNS are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT casual/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT Ballantyne/NNP area/NN ./.
Great/NNP atmosphere/RB ,/, TV/NN 's/POS all/DT around/NNS with/IN any/DT sports/NNS game/IN you/PRP could/MD imagine/VB ,/, excellent/JJ Beer/NNP options/NNS on/IN Draft/NNP ,/, daily/JJ food/NN and/CC drink/NN specials/NNS and/CC relaxed/VBN dining/JJ atmosphere/RB ./.
