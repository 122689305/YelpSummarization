My/NNP only/RB con/NN is/VBZ that/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP n't/RB priced/VBN appropriately/RB ./.
My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD a/DT caprese/JJ salad/NN for/IN $/$ 7/CD and/CC we/PRP both/DT thought/VBD the/DT portion/NN was/VBD chincy/NN ./.
She/PRP was/VBD finished/VBN with/IN it/PRP before/IN I/PRP even/RB finished/VBD cutting/VBG up/RP my/PRP$ wedge/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ wonderful-/JJ friendly/RB and/CC breezy/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ ./.
The/DT mussels/NNS were/VBD cooled/VBN to/TO perfection/NN ./.
The/DT craft/NN beer/NN left/VBD a/DT lot/NN to/TO be/VB desired/VBN !/.
Very/NNP short/VBD list/NN of/IN them/PRP and/CC most/RBS not/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD have/VB thought/VBN with/IN Lager/NNP as/IN the/DT first/JJ part/NN off/IN the/DT name/NN they/PRP would/MD have/VB had/VBD a/DT better/JJ selection/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
Had/IN the/DT simple/NN chicken/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD juicy/NN and/CC the/DT pepper/NN bacon/NN confit/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
My/NNP wife/NN had/VBD the/DT bbq/NN chicken/NN flatbread/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD tasty/JJ ./.
But/CC by/IN far/RB the/DT best/JJS thing/NN about/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD our/JJ server/NN ,/, Michael/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD infectiously/RB joyful/JJ and/CC funny/JJ ./.
Carol/NNP and/CC I/PRP had/VBD burgers/NNS -/JJ bacon/NN burger/NN and/CC bleu/NN burger/NN ./.
Carol/NNP had/VBD fries/NNS and/CC thought/VBD they/PRP were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
Nice/NNP and/CC hot/NN too/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT tater/NN tots/NNS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
Both/DT burgers/NNS were/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC cooked/JJ as/IN ordered/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD ``/`` knife/NN and/CC fork/NN ''/'' style/NN burgers/NNS ,/, unless/IN wearing/VBG a/DT bib/NN ./.
French/JJ onion/NN soup/NN was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC served/JJ nice/NN and/CC hot/NN ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD a/DT bit/JJ skimpy/NN on/IN cheese/NN and/CC onions/NNS though/IN ./.
Otherwise/RB our/JJ review/NN would/MD be/VB 5/JJ stars/NNS ./.
Sadly/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
Was/NNP really/VBD hoping/VBG to/TO find/VB a/DT new/JJ spot/NN in/IN Medina/NNP ./.
I/PRP hear/VBP that/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN food/NN is/VBZ different/JJ than/IN the/DT Hudson/NNP location/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP ordered/VBN flatbread/JJ there/EX 2x/CD (/NN gave/VBD it/PRP a/DT second/JJ chance/NN )/NN but/CC came/VBD up/RP disappointed/JJ again/NN ./.
Does/NNS have/VBP s/NNS great/JJ little/JJ bar/NN to/TO stop/VB by/IN and/CC grab/VB a/DT glass/NN of/IN wine/NN
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT party/NN of/IN 6/NN with/IN a/DT reservation/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS early/RB and/CC the/DT first/JJ to/TO arrive/NN and/CC was/VBD seated/VBN at/IN out/IN table/JJ in/IN the/DT back/NN room/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD at/IN leat/NN 5/CD minutes/NNS before/IN i/NN was/VBD approached/VBN and/CC the/DT waiter/NN wanted/VBD to/TO know/VB how/WRB many/JJ people/NNS and/CC when/WRB I/PRP thought/VBP they/PRP would/MD arrive/VB ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT strange/JJ question/NN ./.
He/PRP then/RB started/VBD to/TO walk/NN away/RB with/IN out/JJ asking/NN if/IN I/PRP wanted/VBP anything/NN while/IN I/PRP was/VBD waiting/VBG ./.
I/PRP stopped/VBD him/PRP and/CC asked/VBD if/IN he/PRP could/MD turn/VB up/RP the/DT heat/NN as/IN I/PRP was/VBD freezing/JJ and/CC had/VBD to/TO put/VB my/PRP$ coat/NN back/RB on/IN ./.
There/EX was/VBD no/DT one/CD else/NN seated/VBN at/IN the/DT time/NN in/IN that/DT room/NN ./.
He/PRP instead/VBD asked/IN if/IN I/PRP wanted/VBP coffee/NN or/CC tea/NN to/TO help/VB me/PRP warm/VB up/IN which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD nice/JJ until/IN I/PRP got/VBD my/PRP$ bill/NN and/CC realized/VBD he/PRP charged/VBD me/PRP $/$ 2.50/CD for/IN one/CD cup/NN of/IN tea/NN which/WDT he/PRP never/VBD refreshed/VBN with/IN warm/NN water/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB did/VBD not/RB turn/VB up/RP the/DT heat/NN which/WDT did/VBD not/RB surprise/VB me/PRP as/IN he/PRP shrugged/VBD his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS when/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD as/RB if/IN he/PRP thought/VBD I/PRP was/VBD nuts/NNS ./.
The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT evening/VBG the/DT service/NN did/VBD n't/RB get/VB any/DT better/NN ./.
He/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ enough/RB ,/, but/CC did/VBD not/RB come/VB back/RB and/CC check/NN on/IN us/PRP ./.
He/PRP forgot/VBD several/JJ things/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP and/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO hunt/VB him/PRP down/IN and/CC then/RB he/PRP carged/VBD us/PRP the/DT regular/JJ price/NN for/IN the/DT taco/NN special/NN and/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO hunt/VB him/PRP down/IN again/RB to/TO fix/NN our/NNS bills/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ./.
The/DT lobster/NN bisque/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB over/IN the/DT top/JJ good/NN ./.
It/PRP could/MD have/VB used/VBN more/JJR sheery/NN and/CC seasoning/NN ./.
The/DT taco/NN 's/POS were/VBD all/DT pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, the/DT homemade/NN tater/NN tots/NNS very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT flat/JJ bread/JJ pizza/NN 's/POS were/VBD dry/JJ and/CC felt/VBD like/IN they/PRP were/VBD thrown/VBN together/RB in/IN a/DT hurry/NN ./.
The/DT pretzels/NNS were/VBD good/JJ and/CC piping/JJ hot/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO hunt/VB our/PRP$ server/NN down/IN again/RB to/TO get/VB plates/NNS to/TO share/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP got/VBD home/NN and/CC looked/VBD at/IN my/PRP$ left/NN overs/NNS of/IN the/DT flatbread/JJ pizza/NN ,/, it/PRP looked/VBD as/IN if/IN he/PRP had/VBD picked/VBN up/RP the/DT plate/NN and/CC dumped/VBD it/PRP in/IN the/DT box/NN ,/, some/DT slices/NNS were/VBD upside/JJ down/RB ,/, some/DT were/VBD sideways/NNS and/CC all/DT of/IN the/DT toppings/NNS were/VBD off/RP the/DT pizza/NN and/CC all/DT over/NNS ./.
I/PRP will/MD give/VB this/DT place/NN one/CD more/RBR try/JJ to/TO see/VB if/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT fluke/NN ./.
We/PRP felt/VBD the/DT food/NN was/VBD overpriced/VBN for/IN what/WP we/PRP recieved/VBD and/CC the/DT service/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN he/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, was/VBD terrible/JJ ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP they/PRP fix/VBP the/DT problems/NNS or/CC they/PRP wo/MD n't/RB last/VB long/RB ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/VBD checked/VBN this/DT place/NN out/IN when/WRB he/PRP knew/VBD we/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO visit/NN family/NN and/CC we/PRP knew/VBD we/PRP had/VBD to/TO come/VB here/RB for/IN a/DT dinner/NN ./.
My/NNP last/JJ evening/NN while/IN on/IN holiday/NN ,/, we/PRP took/VBD my/NNP family/NN out/IN for/IN dinner/NN here/RB ./.
We/PRP reserved/VBD the/DT day/NN before/IN with/IN no/DT problems/NNS ./.
The/DT day/NN of/IN ,/, they/PRP called/VBD us/PRP back/RB and/CC asked/VBD us/PRP if/IN we/PRP were/VBD fine/VBN in/IN a/DT booth/NN that/WDT normally/RB fits/VBZ 4/NN for/IN our/PRP$ group/NN of/IN 5/NNS due/JJ to/TO a/DT wedding/JJ party/NN reservation/NN ./.
Turns/VBZ out/RP this/DT was/VBD just/RB fine/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD well/RB taken/VBN care/NN of/IN ./.
Located/VBN right/NN on/IN the/DT beautiful/JJ Medina/NNP Square/NNP ,/, Lager/NNP &/CC Vine/NNP is/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ and/CC classy/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC is/VBZ impeccably/RB decorated/VBN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ also/RB quite/RB good/JJ --/: I/PRP tend/VBP to/TO get/VB annoyed/VBN in/IN the/DT US/NN when/WRB their/PRP$ service/NN provides/VBZ too/RB much/JJ attention/NN (/NN I/PRP know/VBP ,/, something/NN silly/RB to/TO even/RB complain/VB about/IN )/JJ but/CC I/PRP found/VBD that/IN here/RB they/PRP made/VBD a/DT good/JJ balance/NN of/IN paying/VBG enough/RB attention/NN to/TO get/VB you/PRP drinks/VBZ ,/, take/VB your/PRP$ order/NN ,/, etc/NN ./.
but/CC also/RB did/VBD n't/RB hover/VB too/RB much/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN and/CC drink/NN was/VBD out/IN of/IN this/DT world/NN !/.
There/EX a/DT numerous/JJ delicious/JJ wines/NNS and/CC beers/NNS available/JJ ./.
I/PRP stuck/VBP to/TO beer/NN that/IN night/NN and/CC was/VBD delighted/VBN with/IN all/PDT the/DT different/JJ local/JJ beers/NNS avaialble/JJ ./.
Both/DT my/NN boyfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP tried/VBP the/DT sampler/NN of/IN beers/NNS (/VBP 4/NN or/CC 5/RB different/JJ kinds/NNS )/VBP and/CC clearly/RB had/VBD our/VBN favorites/NNS (/NN among/IN those/DT IPAs/NNS )/VBP ./.
For/IN food/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD the/DT pretzels/NNS and/CC Lager/NNP &/CC Vine/NNP House/NNP Chips/NNP ./.
Everyone/NNP loved/VBD the/DT Chips/NNP (/NNP I/PRP had/VBD one/CD with/IN no/DT meat/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD great/JJ !/NN )/.
and/CC the/DT pretzels/NNS with/IN the/DT cheese/NN and/CC mustard/NN sauces/NNS were/VBD to/TO die/VB for/IN !/.
For/IN the/DT main/JJ course/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Tiquila/NNP Chipotle/NNP Shrimp/NNP Tacos/NNP and/CC loved/VBD these/DT !/NNS
Although/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB include/VB much/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ .../NN also/RB make/VBP sure/JJ to/TO get/VB the/DT homemade/NN tator/NN tots/NNS --/: I/PRP 'm/VBP normally/RB not/RB such/VB a/DT huge/JJ fan/NN but/CC they/PRP hit/VBP the/DT spot/NN ./.
Everyone/NNP else/NN was/VBD just/RB as/IN pleased/JJ with/IN their/PRP$ dinners/NNS as/IN I/PRP was/VBD ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD all/DT so/RB stuffed/JJ that/IN none/NN of/IN us/PRP could/MD fit/VB dessert/NN in/IN (/NNP I/PRP guess/VBZ there/EX 's/VBZ not/RB always/RB room/NN for/IN dessert/NN ?/NN )/NN ./.
Will/NNP definitely/RB go/VB back/RB again/RB to/TO try/VB some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ other/JJ items/NNS --/: they/PRP have/VBP plenty/NN of/IN fish/JJ and/CC vegetarian/JJ options/NNS for/IN me/PRP !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sad/JJ to/TO write/NN this/DT because/IN I/PRP really/RB did/VBD love/VB this/DT place/NN ,/, but/CC since/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ review/NN (/IN 8/CD months/NNS ago/IN )/JJ I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN there/RB another/DT 4/NN or/CC 5/CD times/NNS and/CC every/DT time/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ worse/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/RB ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB found/VBD out/IN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP had/VBN 3/VBN chefs/NNS since/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ opened/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD tell/VB ./.
Something/NN is/VBZ always/RB different/JJ .../NNS and/CC not/RB in/IN a/DT good/JJ way/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT price/NN they/PRP charge/VBP I/PRP would/MD expect/VB more/RBR than/IN mediocre/NN .../: which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS word/NN to/TO describe/VB my/PRP$ last/JJ few/JJ visits/NNS ./.
I/PRP still/RB think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT cool/NN place/NN and/CC the/DT red/JJ Sangria/NNP is/VBZ awesome/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP will/MD stick/VB to/TO drinks/NNS and/CC maybe/VB an/DT app/NN if/when/NN I/PRP do/VBP come/RB again/RB ./.
Had/NNP a/DT nice/JJ dinner/NN here/RB a/DT week/NN ago/IN ./.
All/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ (/NN chips/NNS and/CC cheese/NN ,/, bacon/NN burger/NN ,/, chorizo/NN Mac/NNP n/NNP cheese/NN ,/, flatbread/JJ pizza/NN and/CC sirloin/NN tip/NN pasta/NN )/NN ./.
Good/NNP draft/VBD selection/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD n't/RB crazy/JJ about/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ drafts/NNS and/CC waiter/VB even/RB offered/VBN to/TO refund/NN and/CC replace/VB them/PRP ,/, although/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN bad/JJ (/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ all/DT relative/JJ )/NNS ./.
Nice/NNP ambiance/NN and/CC deceptively/RB large/JJ seating/VBG area/NN ./.
We/PRP 're/VBP fans/NNS and/CC I/PRP 'll/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
A/DT nice/JJ addition/NN to/TO the/DT Medina/NNP Square/NNP ./.
Could/NNP have/VBP been/VBN great/JJ ,/, but/CC bad/JJ service/NN to/TO first/JJ time/NN customer/NN is/VBZ a/DT deal/NN breaker/NN ./.
Came/NNP early/VBD evening/NN with/IN very/RB limited/JJ customers/NNS competing/VBG for/IN blonde/JJ bartender/NN 's/POS attention/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, she/PRP was/VBD more/RBR concerned/JJ about/IN talking/VBG with/IN friends/NNS at/IN another/DT table/JJ about/IN her/PRP recent/JJ hair/NN color/NN change/NN ./.
We/PRP received/VBD sporadic/JJ service/NN and/CC I/PRP actually/RB was/VBD semi-understanding/JJ until/IN after/IN waiting/VBG patiently/RB to/TO get/VB her/PRP attention/IN she/PRP refused/VBD to/TO give/VB me/PRP the/DT happy/NN special/NN on/IN wine/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD 6:02/CD ./.
I/PRP really/VBP was/VBD shocked/VBN given/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB had/VBN plenty/NN of/IN time/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT order/NN in/IN if/IN she/PRP actually/RB was/VBD paying/VBG proper/NN attention/NN to/TO us/PRP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD okay/NN and/CC the/DT wine/NN was/VBD not/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC her/PRP total/JJ disregard/NN for/IN treating/NN customer/NN 's/POS well/RB turned/IN me/PRP off/RP and/CC I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
Food/NNP atmosphere/RB and/CC service/NN first/JJ rate/NN ./.
Full/NNP menu/NN ,/, not/RB bar/JJ food/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
What/WP a/DT pleasant/NN surprise/NN in/IN Medina/NNP ./.
Get/NNP the/DT homemade/NN tater/NN tots/NNS -/JJ there/RB out/IN of/IN this/DT world/NN ./.
Very/NNP overpriced/VBD and/CC I/PRP would/MD not/RB recommend/VB dining/JJ here/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB a/DT completely/RB horrible/JJ experience/NN though/IN .../:
The/DT server/NN 's/POS beer/NN recommendations/NNS were/VBD spot/NN on/IN ,/, the/DT stuffed/JJ peppers/NNS (/VBP though/IN cold/NN )/NNS were/VBD really/RB flavorful/JJ and/CC the/DT highlight/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
The/DT rest/NN was/VBD well/RB below/IN average/JJ despite/NN being/VBG priced/VBN quite/RB high/JJ ./.
The/DT majority/NN of/IN us/PRP chose/VBP to/TO go/VB with/IN a/DT few/JJ small/JJ plates/NNS a/DT piece/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB though/IN there/NNS were/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN the/DT same/JJ dishes/NNS .../: no/DT 2/NN looked/VBD the/DT same/JJ (/NN different/JJ portion/NN sizes/NNS ,/, one/CD plate/NN of/IN scallops/NNS was/VBD seared/VBN on/IN both/DT sides/NNS the/DT other/JJ on/IN just/RB one/CD ,/, different/JJ meat/NN temps./NN ,/, etc/NN ./. )/NN ./.
In/IN general/JJ I/PRP can/MD safely/RB say/VB the/DT whole/JJ meal/NN was/VBD poorly/RB prepared/VBN by/IN people/NNS who/WP were/VBD very/RB inexperienced/JJ ./.
The/DT one/CD constant/NN was/VBD everything/NN was/VBD cold/JJ and/CC had/VBD been/VBN sitting/VBG for/IN a/DT good/JJ bit/NN ./.
Like/IN I/PRP said/VBD before/IN ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT dinner/NN was/VBD disappointing/JJ .../NN but/CC one/CD thing/NN stood/VBD out/RP as/IN offensively/RB horrible/JJ .../: the/DT crab/NN cake/NN ./.
Hands/NNS down/IN the/DT worst/NN crab/NN cake/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ./.
Bone/NNP dry/NNP ,/, completely/RB flavorless/JJ ,/, and/CC on/IN top/NNS of/IN a/DT bed/VBN of/IN rubbery/NN frozen/NN corn/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP make/VBP the/DT mistake/NN of/IN dining/NN here/RB .../: .save/JJ yourself/NN $/$ 16/CD and/CC avoid/CD this/DT disgusting/NN plate/NN .../: stick/NN with/IN the/DT other/JJ overpriced/VBN dishes/NNS ./.
At/IN least/JJS then/RB you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB just/RB disappointed/JJ and/CC not/RB angry/JJ ./.
First/NNP ,/, I/PRP love/VBP places/NNS that/WDT do/VBP small/JJ plates/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB hard/JJ to/TO finish/JJ portions/NNS at/IN a/DT restaurant/NN now/RB ./.
The/DT beer/NN and/CC wine/NN selection/NN here/RB fits/VBZ with/IN the/DT name/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB worry/RB ,/, they/PRP have/VBP fun/VBN drinks/NNS here/RB as/RB well/RB !/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT sangria/NN which/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC had/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/RB much/RB orange/JJ juice/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
Still/RB delightful/JJ though/IN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT lunch/NN combo/NN with/IN the/DT lobster/NN bisque/NN and/CC the/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN ./.

The/DT grilled/VBD cheese/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN was/VBD pretty/RB boring/JJ ./.
Just/NNP some/DT bread/JJ and/CC kraft/JJ singles/NNS like/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB made/VBN at/IN home/NN for/IN my/PRP$ niece/NN and/CC nephew/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD hoping/VBG for/IN a/DT little/JJ more/RBR pizazz/JJ .../: maybe/NN bacon/NN or/CC fancy/NN cheese/NN ?/.
Dipping/VBG the/DT sandwich/NN into/IN the/DT soup/JJ saved/VBD the/DT day/NN though/IN ./.

Now/RB for/IN the/DT food/NN porn/NN .../: To/NNS say/VBP the/DT Bacon/NNP burger/NN was/VBD decadent/JJ is/VBZ an/DT understatement/NN !/.
Great/NNP flavor/NN ,/, juicy/NN ,/, cooked/VBD just/RB right/RB !/.
Gives/NNS b/VBD spot/NN a/DT run/NN for/IN its/PRP$ money/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN top/JJ flight/NN burgers/NNS in/IN town/NN ./.
We/PRP 'll/MD likely/RB be/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB out/RP dinner/NN menu/NN soon/RB ./.

This/DT place/NN has/VBZ good/JJ atmosphere/RB ./.
Right/NN on/IN the/DT square/NN ./.

The/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD overall/JJ very/RB quiet/JJ and/CC the/DT kitchen/NN had/VBD a/DT good/JJ selection/NN of/IN music/JJ going/VBG ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP like/IN to/TO take/VB it/PRP easy/-NONE- and/CC hang/JJ out/IN a/DT while/NN between/IN apps/NNS and/CC entree/NN ,/, ect/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ thing/NN that/IN I/PRP found/VBD (/JJ slightly/RB )/JJ bothersome/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT lighting/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/NN dark/NN ./.
Very/NNP nice/NNP place/NN ,/, would/MD definitely/RB come/VB here/RB again/RB ./.
We/PRP attended/VBD on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ busy/NN ./.
That/DT said/VBD ,/, our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD pretty/RB chilly/RB and/CC inattentive/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ American/JJ fare/NN :/: much/JJ of/IN which/WDT you/PRP can/MD find/VB in/IN other/JJ local/JJ restaurants/NNS ,/, done/RB better/RBR ./.
When/WRB a/DT restaurant/NN states/IN they/PRP are/VBP a/DT gastropub/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD expect/VB to/TO see/VB more/JJR exotic/JJ proteins/NNS than/IN chicken/NN ,/, beef/NN and/CC lobster/NN -/NN especially/RB at/IN the/DT prices/NNS they/PRP wanted/VBD ./.
Generally/RB ,/, the/DT experience/NN was/VBD fine/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB take/VB guests/NNS there/RB ,/, or/CC go/VB back/RB myself/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD just/RB ``/`` ok/NN ''/'' ./.
I/PRP paid/VBD $/$ 15/CD for/IN a/DT small/JJ salad/NN so/IN I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ overpriced/VBN ./.

The/DT first/JJ time/NN we/PRP visited/VBD it/PRP was/VBD alright/VB the/DT salmon/NN with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.

The/DT already/RB small/JJ portions/NNS seem/VBP to/TO get/VB smaller/JJR and/CC service/NN was/VBD something/NN to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ./.
Lost/NNP reservations/NNS and/CC slow/JJ service/NN for/IN drinks/NNS and/CC refills/NNS was/VBD something/NN to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN ./.
Overall/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ but/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB get/VB much/RB for/IN what/WP you/PRP pay/VBP for/IN ./.

He/PRP may/MD think/VB his/PRP$ s**t/NN does/VBZ n't/RB stink/VB ,/, but/CC on/IN this/DT night/NN his/PRP$ food/NN did/VBD ./.
The/DT chicken/NN tacos/VBZ (/JJ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB spicy/JJ but/CC were/VBD n't/RB very/RB )/VB were/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT appetizer/NN ,/, chips/NNS with/IN gorgonzola/NN and/CC bacon/NN ,/, was/VBD good/JJ but/CC too/RB rich/JJ and/CC salty/NN by/IN far/RB ./.
