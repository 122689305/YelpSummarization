The/DT large/JJ group/NN of/IN asian/JJ guys/NNS at/IN the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP were/VBD unhappy/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
I/PRP heard/VBP them/PRP telling/VBG the/DT waiter/waitress/NN she/PRP got/VBD the/DT order/NN wrong/NN ,/, did/VBD n't/RB bring/VB out/RP everything/NN they/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN ,/, brought/VBD out/RP wrong/JJ dishes/NNS ,/, got/VBD the/DT bill/NN wrong/JJ etc/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO admit/VB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ skeptical/JJ about/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, when/WRB a/DT friend/NN suggested/IN it/PRP ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ !/.
My/NNP cousin/NN and/CC I/PRP shared/VBD the/DT fried/VBN rice/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT chicken/NN dumpling/VBG noodle/NN soup/NN ./.
We/PRP all/VBP shared/VBN some/DT bao/NN ,/, and/CC sio/NN mai/NN (/VBD sp/NN ?/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD because/IN I/PRP was/VBD starving/VBG ,/, or/CC if/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT food/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD the/DT best/JJS chinese/NN food/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
Reservations/NNS are/VBP probably/RB best/RB with/IN them/PRP ,/, as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ get/VB crowded/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN ?/.
Well/NNP .../: it/PRP 's/VBZ typical/JJ ./.
It/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB authentic/JJ ,/, if/IN it/PRP were/VBD otherwise/RB ,/, right/RB ?/.
It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ open/JJ again/RB !/.

We/PRP had/VBD the/DT prix/NN fixe/NN menu/NN that/WDT was/VBD complimentary/JJ for/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS bday/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ some/DT really/RB Americanized/VBN Chinese/JJ food/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ fine/NN if/IN it/PRP tasted/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC extures/NNS and/CC flavors/NNS were/VBD not/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT sake/NN was/VBD was/VBD pretty/RB cheap/JJ compared/VBN to/TO the/DT prices/NNS of/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP the/DT a/DT la/NN carte/NN items/NNS are/VBP better/JJ ,/, who/WP knows/NNS ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, very/RB attentive/JJ ./.
The/DT place/NN looks/VBZ nice/JJ but/CC kind/JJ of/IN too/RB sterile/JJ ,/, not/RB much/RB character/NN or/CC charm/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD dead/JJ when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD there/RB for/IN dinner/NN and/CC too/RB quiet/RB ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/RB to/TO this/DT joint/NN ./.
Ok/NNP Seriously/NNP ,/, if/IN I/PRP can/MD give/VB this/DT place/NN negative/JJ stars/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD ./.
We/PRP paid/VBD $/$ 50/CD for/IN two/CD dishes/NNS and/CC they/PRP were/VBD absolutely/RB horrible/JJ ./.
Mind/IN you/PRP ,/, it/PRP maybe/RB because/IN we/PRP are/VBP vegis/NNS and/CC they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB much/JJ vegi/NN options/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, both/DT dishes/NNS tasted/VBD exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB like/IN they/PRP added/VBD steamed/VBN veggies/NNS on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT rice/NN &/CC noodles/NNS and/CC tasted/VBN yuckie/NN ./.
The/DT guy/NN came/VBD and/CC asked/VBD us/PRP how/WRB everything/NN was/VBD and/CC we/PRP did/VBD say/VB ,/, horrible/JJ ./.
We/PRP barely/RB touched/VBD any/DT of/IN our/PRP$ food/NN and/CC decided/VBD to/TO get/VB real/JJ dinner/NN after/IN we/PRP left/VBP this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD never/RB go/VB there/RB again/RB because/IN in/IN all/DT honesty/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT prices/NNS they/PRP charge/RB ,/, when/WRB a/DT customer/NN tells/NNS you/PRP that/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD n't/RB good/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS attempt/CD to/TO find/CD out/IN if/IN you/PRP can/MD fix/VB the/DT situation/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP appeared/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD only/RB interested/JJ collecting/VBG the/DT money/NN ,/, not/RB really/RB making/VB sure/JJ they/PRP served/VBD food/NN that/IN was/VBD pallatable/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ customers/NNS ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB to/TO stay/VB away/RB if/IN you/PRP want/VBP decent/JJ tasting/VBG food/NN and/CC good/JJ service/NN ./.
Another/DT thing/NN .../: ./. this/DT place/NN really/RB does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB ``/`` true/JJ ''/'' asian/JJ foods../NN maybe/NN has/VBZ something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN not/RB having/VBG too/RB many/JJ people/NNS there/EX who/WP know/-NONE- what/WP real/JJ Asian/JJ food/NN tastes/NNS like/IN ./.

We/PRP ate/VBP here/RB after/IN the/DT late/JJ show/NN of/IN Le/NNP Reve/NNP and/CC I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBD the/DT food/NN ./.
First/NNP ,/, there/EX are/VBP not/RB many/JJ restaurants/NNS ,/, other/JJ than/IN the/DT cafes/NNS ,/, open/JJ after/IN 11pm/CD ./.
Jade/NN was/VBD more/JJR than/IN happy/JJ to/TO seat/NN us/NN and/CC we/PRP proceeded/VBD to/TO order/NN 4/RB different/JJ courses/NNS that/IN we/PRP shared/VBD ./.
Each/DT one/CD was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC I/PRP probably/RB have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT black/NN been/VBN and/CC beef/JJ noodles/NNS were/VBD the/DT best/JJS by/IN far/RB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN in/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ calming/VBG with/IN dark/JJ red/VBN walls/NNS and/CC the/DT wait/NN staff/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
While/IN we/PRP were/VBD dining/VBG there/NN was/VBD another/DT customer/NN who/WP walked/VBN in/IN ,/, a/DT bit/NN drunk/NN ,/, and/CC proceeded/VBD to/TO yell/NN at/IN the/DT waiter/NN and/CC then/RB manager/VBD about/IN wanting/VBG something/NN unique/NN from/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ,/, that/DT was/VBD not/RB on/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN she/PRP made/VBD quite/JJ the/DT scene/NN ,/, the/DT staff/NN handled/VBD the/DT situation/NN well/RB ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT I/PRP was/VBD impressed/VBN and/CC would/MD definitely/RB return/VB ./.
I/PRP really/VBP like/IN Jade/NN ./.

The/DT crazy/NN thing/NN about/IN Jade/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB just/RB Chinese/JJ food/NN -/NN they/PRP have/VBP about/IN every/DT kind/NN of/IN asian/JJ food/NN you/PRP would/MD like/VB :/: Chinese/JJ ,/, Sushi/NNP ,/, Thai/NNP -/NNP you/PRP name/VB it/PRP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
