My/NNP fiance/NN and/CC I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD this/DT place/NN ./.
Huge/NNP step/VBD up/RP from/IN Stonepepper/NNP Grill/NNP ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD quick/JJ and/CC on/IN point/NN ./.
Tried/IN the/DT bruschetta/NN ,/, chicken/VBN parm/NN and/CC cajun/NN salmon/NN ./.
Every/NNP dish/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC the/DT chicken/NN parm/NN was/VBD better/JJR than/IN many/JJ spots/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
The/DT one/CD negative/NN was/VBD the/DT hostesses/NNS attitudes/NNS ./.
They/PRP seemed/VBD stressed/VBN and/CC frustrated/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD busy/NN at/IN 7pm/CD in/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN which/WDT should/MD make/VB them/PRP happy/JJ ,/, right/RB ?/.
Wow/NNP ./.
So/RB surprised/VBD at/IN the/DT one/CD and/CC two/CD star/JJ reviews/NNS !/.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT most/RBS tender/JJ calamari/NN ./.
Although/IN the/DT marinara/NN sauce/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ bland/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT touch/NN of/IN salt/JJ made/NN it/PRP just/RB right/RB ./.
My/NNP husband/NN had/VBD the/DT veal/NN with/IN peppers/NNS and/CC said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD so/RB delicious/JJ and/CC tender/NN ./.
The/DT mashed/JJ potatoes/NNS were/VBD perfect/RB ./.

Our/PRP$ salad/NN was/VBD beautiful/JJ !/.

We/PRP ended/VBD our/PRP$ delicious/JJ meal/NN with/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN tiramisu/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN Matt/NNP was/VBD right/RB on/IN !/NNP !/.
Very/NNP pleasant/NN and/CC knowledgeable/JJ about/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
Our/NNP appetizer/NN ,/, salad/JJ and/CC entrees/NNS were/VBD timed/VBN perfectly/RB ./.
I/PRP love/VBP salad/JJ and/CC did/VBD not/RB mind/VB that/IN my/PRP$ entree/NN was/VBD served/VBN while/IN I/PRP was/VBD still/RB eating/VBG it/PRP !/.
No/DT problem/NN it/PRP let/VBD my/PRP$ dinner/NN cool/NN to/TO just/RB the/DT right/NN temp/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO eat/VB it/PRP comfortably/RB ./.
I/PRP wonder/VBP sometimes/RB if/IN people/NNS just/RB do/VBP n't/RB appreciate/VB relaxing/JJ and/CC taking/JJ time/NN to/TO eat/VB a/DT wonderful/JJ and/CC beautifully/RB prepared/VBN meal/NN ./.
A/DT wonderful/JJ atmosphere/NN ./.

The/DT chairs/NNS are/VBP super/NN comfortable/JJ too/RB !/RB !/VB !/.
We/PRP will/MD certainly/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
Give/NNP it/PRP a/DT try/NN ./.

A/DT bottle/NN of/IN Riesling/NNP ,/, calamari/NNP app/NNP ,/, two/CD delicious/JJ entrees/NNS and/CC dessert/NN for/IN $/$ 92/CD !/.
Well/NNP with/IN it/PRP ./.
Came/NNP here/RB trying/VBG a/DT new/JJ place/NN ./.
Literally/RB !/.
Just/NNP opened/VBD two/CD days/NNS ago/RB and/CC well/RB worth/IN it/PRP !/.
Warmly/NNP welcomed/VBD at/IN the/DT front/NN by/IN a/DT nice/JJ hostess/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP 're/VBP told/JJ we/PRP could/MD even/RB have/VB a/DT seat/NN in/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
Since/IN we/PRP were/VBD interested/JJ in/IN the/DT Pirates/NNP game/NN ,/, it/PRP worked/VBD out/RP ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT few/JJ TV/NN 's/POS in/IN the/DT bar/NN for/IN such/JJ purposes/NNS ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP our/RB drinks/VBZ ;/: Prosecco/NNP &/CC Malbec/NNP ./.
Both/DT by/IN the/DT glass/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN gave/VBD us/PRP big/JJ glasses/NNS of/IN water/NN with/IN out/NN drinks/NNS so/RB A+/RB there/RB ./.
The/DT bread/JJ came/VBD out/RP first/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD awesome/JJ ./.
Perfectly/RB warmed/VBD ,/, large/JJ slices/NNS ,/, crunchy/JJ crusted/JJ Italian/JJ bread/NN that/WDT tasted/VBN like/IN it/PRP was/VBD made/VBN in/IN house/NN ./.
Served/JJ with/IN ambient/JJ temperature/NN butter/NN (/IN another/DT pet/NN peeve/NN of/IN mine/NN is/VBZ ice/JJ cold/NN butter/NN )/VBD so/RB A+/RB The/DT salad/JJ came/VBD out/IN next/JJ and/CC was/VBD the/DT first/JJ area/NN where/WRB we/PRP 'd/VBP recommend/VBN a/DT little/JJ change/NN ,/, maybe/VB a/DT little/JJ larger/NN for/IN sharing/NN between/IN two/CD ./.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD flavorful/JJ ,/, cold/JJ ,/, and/CC dressed/VBD just/RB right/RB ./.
The/DT fresh/JJ cracked/JJ pepper/NN added/VBD to/TO it/PRP so/RB overall/JJ :/: B/NNP Next/NNP our/NNP entrees/VBZ :/: I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Three-Cheese/JJ Lasagna/NNP my/NNP partner/NN had/VBD the/DT Gambellini/NNP Fra/NNP Diavolo/NNP (/NNP sorry/NN if/IN I/PRP misspelled/VBD it/PRP ./. )/''
they/PRP came/VBD out/RP at/IN just/RB the/DT right/NN temperature/NN and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD a/DT bite/NN of/IN his/PRP$ dish/JJ and/CC the/DT Diavolo/NNP was/VBD mild/JJ ,/, but/CC with/IN a/DT ``/`` back-of-the-throat/NN ''/'' heat/NN which/WDT is/VBZ perfect/NN ./.
So/NN :/: ``/`` A/DT ''/'' for/IN his/PRP$ dish/JJ ./.
My/NNP lasagna/NN was/VBD rather/RB impressive/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB realize/VB the/DT recipe/NN was/VBD total/JJ cheese/NN lasagna/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ downside/NN would/MD be/VB a/DT personal/JJ preference/NN of/IN a/DT little/JJ more/RBR herbs/NNS or/CC spice/NN in/IN the/DT cheese/NN mixture/NN ./.
The/DT tomato/NN sauce/NN was/VBD slightly/RB sweet/JJ and/CC tasted/VBD of/IN homemade/NN ./.
So/RB well/RB worth/JJ trying/VBG !/.
Overall/IN the/DT reason/NN behind/IN the/DT 4-star/JJ review/NN is/VBZ only/RB for/IN the/DT slight/NN downsides/NNS ,/, but/CC again/RB ,/, could/MD just/RB be/VB my/VBN personal/JJ preference/NN ./.
I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP coming/VBG here/RB to/TO try/VB it/PRP out/IN !/.
Great/NNP ambience/NN and/CC extensive/JJ menu/NN ./.
The/DT wine/NN selection/NN was/VBD limited/VBN but/CC of/IN good/JJ quality/NN ./.
The/DT appetizer/NN Arancini/NNP were/VBD good/JJ but/CC seemed/JJ to/TO just/RB be/VB a/DT little/JJ bland/NN the/DT tomato/NN sauce/NN helped/VBD but/CC it/PRP too/RB needed/VBD more/RBR garlic/JJ ./.
My/NNP salad/VBD had/VBD too/RB much/JJ vinegar/NN and/CC was/VBD drowning/VBG in/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT seafood/NN Rollitini/NNP was/VBD ok/JJ but/CC under/IN seasoned/VBN ./.
The/DT strawberry/JJ mascarpone/NN cake/NN ,/, basically/RB tiramisu/VBN with/IN strawberries/NNS instead/RB of/IN chocolate/NN ,/, was/VBD just/RB good/JJ not/RB great/JJ ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD ok/JJ but/CC given/RB the/DT lack/NN of/IN a/DT crowd/NN should/MD it/PRP should/MD have/VB been/VBN better/JJR ./.
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB the/DT best/JJS but/CC far/RB better/JJR than/IN a/DT chain/NN store/NN ./.
Would/NNP I/PRP go/VBP back/RB probably/RB yes/VBZ at/IN least/JJS one/CD more/RBR time/NN ./.

My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD to/TO Pazzo/NNP 's/POS for/IN dinner/NN during/IN restaurant/JJ week/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD both/DT disappointed/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ entrees/NNS ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD off/RP the/DT restaurant/JJ week/NN menu/NN ./.
We/PRP both/VBP loved/VBN the/DT lobster/NN bisque/NN ./.
My/NNP husband/NN 's/POS crab/NN ravioli/NN was/VBD not/RB warm/NN ./.
My/NNP veal/NN romano/NN was/VBD hard/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ to/TO cut/NN and/CC eat/NN ./.
My/NNP vegetable/JJ ,/, carrots/NNS ,/, were/VBD also/RB not/RB soft/VB enough/JJ to/TO chew/NN ./.
We/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT ice/NN cream/NN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ./.
We/PRP may/MD try/VB Pazzo/NNP '/POS s/NNS for/IN lunch/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP wish/VBP we/PRP would/MD have/VB chosen/VBN a/DT different/JJ restaurant/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
We/PRP loved/VBD our/PRP$ experience/NN here/RB tonight/NN ./.
Kim/NNP was/VBD our/VBN waitress/NN and/CC she/PRP was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Our/NNP children/NNS have/VBP an/DT allergenic/JJ disease/NN and/CC are/VBP very/RB limited/JJ in/IN what/WP they/PRP can/MD eat/VB ./.
I/PRP also/RB have/VBP Celiac/NNP 's/POS disease/NN ,/, so/RB no/DT gluten/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
Our/NNP meals/NNS came/VBD out/RP just/RB right/RB ,/, they/PRP made/VBD special/JJ accommodations/NNS for/IN the/DT kids/NNS and/CC even/RB had/VBD gluten/VBN free/JJ breadsticks/NNS they/PRP could/MD eat/VB ./.
You/PRP have/VBP now/RB become/VBN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ new/JJ favorite/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN looks/VBZ lovely/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP beautiful/JJ paintings/NNS on/IN the/DT walls/NNS ./.
The/DT tables/NNS are/VBP set/VBN nicely/RB ./.
You/PRP are/VBP greeted/VBN kindly/RB ./.
The/DT servers/NNS are/VBP very/RB nice/JJ ./.
The/DT decor/environment/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/RB reason/JJ I/PRP can/MD give/VB one/CD star/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD all/DT downhill/NN after/IN that/DT ./.
I/PRP say/VBP all/DT the/DT time/NN that/IN of/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB get/VB the/DT basics/NN right/RB you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB get/VB anything/NN beyond/IN the/DT basics/NNS right/RB ./.
So/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD basic/JJ dishes-fettuccine/JJ Alfredo/NNP and/CC Spaghetti/NNP &/CC Meatballs/NNP ./.
We/PRP chose/VBP to/TO skip/NN appetizers/NNS but/CC a/DT family/NN style/NN salad/NN was/VBD brought/VBN to/TO out/IN table/JJ ./.
It/PRP included/VBD a/DT few/JJ cucumbers/NNS ,/, a/DT few/JJ grape/NN tomatoes/NNS ,/, some/DT purple/NN onions/NNS and/CC a/DT few/JJ croutons/NNS ./.
There/EX salad/JJ was/VBD cold/JJ but/CC there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN memorable/JJ about/IN it/PRP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD also/RB served/VBN 2/JJ slices/NNS of/IN bread/JJ ./.
Again/NNP ,/, nothing/NN that/IN stood/NN out/IN ./.
The/DT entrees/NNS were/VBD brought/VBN out/RP while/IN we/PRP were/VBD still/RB eating/VBG our/PRP$ salad/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD awkward/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP went/VBD to/TO eat/VB our/PRP$ entrees/NNS they/PRP were/VBD room/NN temperature/NN ./.
The/DT meatballs/NNS were/VBD over/IN cooked/JJ ,/, dry/JJ ,/, and/CC did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB to/TO have/VB any/DT seasoning/NN ./.
The/DT spaghetti/NN sauce/NN tasted/VBD like/IN tomatoes/NNS and/CC not/RB much/JJ else/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD extremely/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
I/PRP also/RB tasted/VBD the/DT fettuccine/NN ./.
It/PRP too/RB lacked/VBD flavor/NN ./.
The/DT fettuccine/JJ noodles/NNS were/VBD inconsistent/NN ./.
Some/DT were/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO the/DT correct/NN consistency/NN but/CC some/DT were/VBD hard/RB ./.
We/PRP skipped/VBD dessert/NN because/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO take/VB the/DT chance/NN of/IN eating/VBG anything/NN else/RB that/IN lacked/JJ flavor/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ safe/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN there/RB wo/MD n't/RB be/VB a/DT second/JJ visit/NN ./.
Great/JJ food/NN !/.
Thoroughly/RB impressed/VBN with/IN bolognese/NN ,/, manicotti/NN ,/, and/CC veal/NN ./.
Meatballs/NNS were/VBD soft/RB and/CC plenty/NN of/IN flavor/NN ./.
Sauce/NNP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/NN sweet/NN for/IN my/PRP$ liking/NN ,/, but/CC still/RB good/JJ ./.
Service/NNP needs/VBD tightened/VBN up/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP still/RB new/JJ ./.
Overpriced/NNP and/CC flavroless/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN tries/VBZ really/RB hard/JJ to/TO seem/VB fancy/NN ,/, but/CC falls/VBZ far/RB short/JJ ./.
The/DT bread/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD paired/VBN with/IN ice/JJ cold/NN ,/, solid/JJ butter/NN ./.
The/DT salad/JJ ,/, as/IN others/NNS mentiones/NNS ,/, had/VBD very/RB little/JJ nearly-flavorless/JJ dressing/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT chicken/VBN marsala/NN (/VBD $/$ 18/CD )/CD ./.
The/DT three/CD chicken/NN tenders/NNS that/WDT comprised/JJ it/PRP were/VBD tender/RB ./.
The/DT sauce/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, was/VBD a/DT mess/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD as/IN if/IN they/PRP splashed/VBD some/DT marsala/NN wine/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB dumped/VBD the/DT chicken/NN onto/VBD the/DT plate/NN ,/, oil/NN and/CC all/DT ,/, straight/RB from/IN the/DT sautee/NN pan/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD sweet/JJ ,/, watery/NN ,/, spotted/VBD with/IN oil/NN ,/, and/CC devoid/NN of/IN any/DT kind/NN of/IN seasoning/NN ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, it/PRP had/VBD a/DT few/JJ sliced/JJ mushrooms/NNS ,/, too/RB ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP pasta/NN with/IN white/JJ sauce/NN for/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
Bad/NNP move/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pasta/NN tossed/VBN in/IN plain/NN white/JJ sauce/NN -/NN no/DT cheese/NN ,/, no/DT garlic/NN ,/, not/RB even/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN salt/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN had/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN scampi/NN (/VBD $/$ 22/CD )/CD ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN 4/CD or/CC 5/CD shrimp/NN that/IN were/VBD actually/RB quite/JJ big/JJ ./.
They/PRP were/VBD n't/RB overcooked/VBN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN ,/, again/RB ,/, was/VBD a/DT watery/NN mess/NN ,/, a/DT bunch/NN of/IN butter/NN quickly/RB thrown/VBN together/RB with/IN some/DT white/JJ wine/NN ./.
The/DT whole/JJ thing/NN was/VBD topped/VBN with/IN *garlic/JJ powder*/NNS ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB any/DT of/IN it/PRP was/VBD seasoned/VBN with/IN salt/JJ or/CC anything/NN else/RB ./.
She/PRP chose/VBP broccoli/NN for/IN her/PRP side/NN ./.
Aside/NN from/IN the/DT bread/JJ ,/, the/DT broccoli/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
Come/JJ here/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG to/TO spend/VB $/$ 20/CD a/DT plate/NN for/IN food/NN that/IN 's/POS below/NN even/RB Olive/JJ Garden/NNP 's/POS standards/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN here/RB was/VBD slow/JJ and/CC unenthusiastic/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP willing/JJ to/TO bet/NN that/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT cooks/NNS have/VBP ever/VBN actually/RB tasted/VBN the/DT food/NN they/PRP 're/VBP sending/VBG out/RP ./.
I/PRP only/RB gave/VBD it/PRP two/CD stars/NNS because/IN the/DT food/NN did/VBD not/RB make/VB me/JJ sick/NN ./.
The/DT perfect/NN word/NN for/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ :/: bland/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT eggplant/JJ Parmesan/NNP ,/, which/WDT had/VBD too/RB much/RB breading/JJ &/CC was/VBD bland/JJ ./.
Another/DT person/NN in/IN our/PRP$ group/NN had/VBD the/DT Greek/NNP pizza/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD thin/NNP &/CC crispy/NNP &/CC bland/NNP ./.
On/IN the/DT bright/JJ side/NN (/IN I/PRP guess/VBP )/RB ,/, the/DT kids/NNS liked/VBD their/PRP$ chicken/NN fingers/NNS because/IN ,/, hey/NN ,/, kids/NNS like/IN their/PRP$ food/NN bland/NN !/.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB comment/VB on/IN the/DT food/NN here/RB because/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB that/IN far/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD in/IN a/DT hurry/NN on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP and/CC there/NNP was/VBD an/DT hour/NN wait/NN at/IN Bonefish/NNP so/IN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/NNP Pazzo/NNP because/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO since/IN it/PRP opened/VBD ./.
The/DT parking/NN lot/NN was/VBD pretty/RB empty/JJ and/CC very/RB empty/JJ inside/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP now/RB I/PRP know/VBP why/RB ./.
They/PRP seated/VBD us/PRP immediately/RB and/CC then/RB nothing/NN ./.
We/PRP saw/VBD other/JJ waiters/NNS at/IN other/JJ tables/NNS and/CC people/NNS cleaning/VBG up/RP and/CC nobody/NN even/RB looked/VBD at/IN us/PRP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD like/IN we/PRP were/VBD invisible/JJ ./.
They/PRP were/VBD n't/RB even/RB busy/VB ./.
After/IN almost/RB 15/CD minutes/NNS we/PRP got/VBD up/RP and/CC left/NN and/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN told/VBD the/DT hostess/NN we/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB coming/VBG back/RB ./.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN ignored/VBN in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN before/IN but/CC now/RB ,/, based/VBN on/IN the/DT reviews/NNS ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB waste/VB money/NN on/IN the/DT food/NN ./.

It/PRP took/VBD over/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN the/DT food/NN to/TO arrive/VB at/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
The/DT portions/NNS were/VBD generous/JJ ,/, however/RB nothing/NN was/VBD seasoned/VBN properly/RB ./.
Shrimp/NNP Scampi/NNP was/VBD covered/VBN in/IN garlic/JJ powder/NN sitting/VBG in/IN a/DT bowl/NN filled/VBN with/IN microwaved/JJ butter/NN ./.
The/DT broccoli/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/NN ./.
The/DT salad/NN that/IN 's/POS given/NNS lacked/VBD any/DT dressing/NN ./.
The/DT dressing/NN was/VBD bland/JJ ./.
The/DT beer/NN is/VBZ over/IN priced/NN ./.

I/PRP could/MD see/VB if/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT 10/CD %/NN DuClaw/NN on/IN draft/NN for/IN Pazzo/NNP 's/POS to/TO have/VB a/DT reason/NN to/TO charge/VB that/IN much/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ depressing/VBG ./.
Servers/NNS do/VBP n't/RB smile/VB here/RB or/CC seem/RB enthusiastic/JJ ./.
Perhaps/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ because/IN they/PRP feel/VBP guilty/NN for/IN being/VBG the/DT poor/JJ souls/NNS to/TO serve/VB below/IN average/JJ food/NN for/IN such/JJ a/DT sky-high/JJ price/NN ./.

Now/RB save/JJ yourself/JJ money/NN and/CC go/VB to/TO Chick-fil-A/NNP next/IN door/NNP ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB understand/VB the/DT 2/NN star/NN reviews/NNS ./.

Four/NNP of/IN us/PRP sat/JJ down/NNS and/CC ordered/VBN Cabernet/NNP ./.
After/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS the/DT waiter/NN stopped/VBD by/IN to/TO have/VB us/PRP remind/VB him/PRP what/WP beer/NN we/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN .../: We/PRP placed/VBP our/VBN order/NN for/IN food/NN and/CC he/PRP brought/VBD out/RP a/DT ``/`` family/NN style/NN ''/'' salad/NN ./.

The/DT funny/JJ part/NN was/VBD they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP a/DT gallon/NN of/IN dressing/VBG per/IN person../NN We/PRP decided/VBD that/IN since/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT new/JJ place/NN in/IN town/NN we/PRP would/MD order/VB a/DT few/JJ apps/NNS so/RB that/IN we/PRP could/MD try/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.

Both/DT were/VBD dripping/VBG grease/NN and/CC had/VBD zero/VBN flavor/NN what/WP so/RB ever/RB ./.
Luckily/NNP I/PRP had/VBD lots/NNS of/IN the/DT Lemom/NNP Basil/NNP dressing/NN left/NN from/IN my/PRP$ salad/JJ to/TO give/VB the/DT Calamari/NNP the/DT citrus/NN it/PRP needed/VBD (/RB never/RB been/VBN served/VBN Calamari/NNP without/IN a/DT lemon/NN to/TO squeeze/VB on/IN top/JJ )/NN ./.
The/DT Zucchini/NNP was/VBD so/RB soaked/VBN in/IN grease/NN none/NN of/IN us/PRP could/MD eat/VB it/PRP ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB clear/JJ off/IN the/DT table/JJ so/NN at/IN this/DT point/NN we/PRP are/VBP overloaded/VBN and/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT room/NN for/IN the/DT bread/JJ that/DT was/VBD brought/VBN to/TO the/DT table/JJ ./.
Unfortunately/RB we/PRP made/VBD room/NN for/IN it/PRP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD the/DT most/RBS stale/JJ bread/JJ I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
Perhaps/NNP I/PRP was/VBD mistaken/VBN and/CC they/PRP brough/VBP us/PRP croutons/NNS to/TO go/VB with/IN our/PRP$ lettuce/NN ?/.
I/PRP 'll/VBP wrap/JJ up/RP with/IN the/DT entrees/NNS ./.
