A/DT really/NN cute/NN place/NN that/WDT is/VBZ really/RB quite/JJ large/JJ !/.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ section/NN for/IN truffles/NNS and/CC chocolates/NNS ,/, a/DT little/JJ section/NN for/IN speciality/NN baked/VBD goods/NNS and/CC cakes/NNS ,/, a/DT little/JJ bread/JJ section/NN ,/, a/DT little/JJ section/NN for/IN cheese/NN ,/, a/DT little/JJ section/NN for/IN take/NN home/NN type/NN foods/NNS -/JJ i.e./NN ,/, box/NN of/IN petite/JJ fours/NNS ,/, macarons/NNS ,/, pies/NNS ,/, savoury/JJ type/NN foods/NNS ,/, and/CC another/DT little/JJ area/NN with/IN sandwiches/yogurt//JJ cafeteria/NN type/NN items/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ place/NN to/TO grab/VB a/DT little/JJ treat/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT really/RB beautiful/JJ park/NN close/NN by/IN called/NNP Bois/NNP Franc/NNP ./.
The/DT shop/NN is/VBZ located/VBN right/RB by/IN a/DT large/JJ complex/NN of/IN relatively/RB upper/JJ middle/NN class/NN town/NN homes/NNS ./.
So/IN I/PRP expect/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN their/PRP$ business/NN comes/NNS from/IN the/DT neighbourhood/NN ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP what/VBG you/PRP would/MD expect/VB -/JJ about/IN $/$ 4-5/CD for/IN a/DT little/JJ tart/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT pear/NN and/CC almond/NN tart/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB bad/JJ .../: buttery/NN and/CC not/RB too/RB sweet/JJ but/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB knock/VB my/PRP$ socks/NNS off/IN ./.
Cute/NNP place/NN :/: )/.
Extremely/RB snooty/JJ place/NN ./.
they/PRP ALL/VBP refuse/NN to/TO speak/VB English/NNP !/.
Give/NNP me/VBD a/DT break/NN !/.
The/DT pastry/NN and/CC bread/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP can/MD communicate/VB to/TO them/PRP without/IN having/NN to/TO point/NN at/IN everything/NN ./.
Expensive/JJ with/IN an/DT attitude/NN ./.
I/PRP now/RB go/VBP elsewhere/RB when/WRB spending/NN 45.00/CD on/IN a/DT cake/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP so/RB happy/JJ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT location/NN close/NN to/TO my/PRP$ photo/NN studio/NN so/IN I/PRP can/MD pick/VB up/RP delicious/JJ treats/NNS for/IN client/NN meetings/NNS ./.
My/NNP favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT chocolate/NN cake/NN or/CC the/DT plate/NN of/IN mini/NN pastries/NNS (/VBP not/RB always/RB displayed/VBN in/IN the/DT pasty/NN case/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP ask/VBP ,/, they/PRP will/MD usually/RB have/VB some/DT in/IN the/DT back/NN )/NN ./.
Pastries/NNP &/CC baguettes/NNS are/VBP always/RB fresh/JJ ,/, service/NN is/VBZ prompt/JJ &/CC polite/JJ and/CC there/EX is/VBZ ample/JJ parking/VBG out/RP front/NN ./.
Pour/NNP la/NNP pâtisserie/NN ,/, je/NN trouve/NN que/JJ qualité/prix/NN est/JJS le/NN meilleur/NN ./.
On/IN peut/NN aller/NN ailleur/NN pour/JJ moins/NNS cher/NN ,/, mais/VBZ moins/NNS bon/NN aussi/NN ./.
Bunch/NN of/IN snoots/NNS !/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB who/WP the/DT workers/NNS think/VBP they/PRP are/VBP but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB you/PRP 're/VBP getting/VBG paid/NNS that/WDT much/JJ to/TO act/NN like/IN you/PRP all/DT own/JJ the/DT place/NN ./.
Smile/JJ once/NNS in/IN a/DT while/IN it/PRP will/MD do/VB you/PRP good/VB ./.
Your/PRP$ pastries/NNS are/VBP not/RB that/IN good/JJ ./.
And/CC your/PRP$ coffees/NNS .../: well/RB lets/NNS say/VBP better/JJR spend/NN your/PRP$ money/NN elsewhere/RB ./.
Its/PRP$ awful/JJ ./.
Love/NNP all/DT their/PRP$ fruity/NN cakes/NNS ./.
Really/RB quality/JJ stuff/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP chocolate-y/JJ cakes/NNS are/VBP too/RB rich/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./.
Check/NNP your/VBD cakes/NNS if/IN you/PRP preordered/VBD to/TO make/VB sure/JJ you/PRP have/VBP the/DT right/NN one/CD !/NN
They/PRP messed/VBD up/RP our/PRP$ last/JJ order/NN when/WRB we/PRP reserved/VBD two/CD cakes/NNS ./.
Their/NNP Sicilian/NNP bread/NN is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
Their/NNP almonds/NNS chocolatines/NNS are/VBP a/DT bit/JJ too/NN rich/NN and/CC sweet/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT abricotine/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP had/VBD bad/VBN experiences/NNS a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/IN with/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT fridge/NN back/RB then/RB which/WDT made/VBN all/DT my/NNS pastries/NNS smell/NN and/CC taste/NN like/IN burned/VBN electronics/NNS mixed/VBN ./.
Worst/NNP thing/VBD I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Thinking/VBG about/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ me/PRP cringe/NN ./.
The/DT workers/NNS should/MD have/VB fixed/VBN the/DT issue/NN right/NN away/RB or/CC at/IN least/JJS not/RB sell/VB those/DT pastries/NNS ./.
Aside/NN from/IN that/DT ,/, everything/NN else/RB seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB quite/JJ decent/JJ now/RB ./.
Their/NNP cured/VBD meat/NN cuts/NNS are/VBP nicely/RB salted/VBN and/CC flavorful/JJ ./.
I/PRP never/VBP stayed/VBN long/RB enough/JJ to/TO devour/VB my/PRP$ fruit/NN cake/NN ,/, I/PRP usually/RB take/VBP it/PRP home/-NONE- and/CC enjoy/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT warm/NN coffee/NN ./.
I/PRP only/RB gave/VBD this/DT location/NN 4*/CD because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ prices/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP on/IN the/DT higher/JJR end/NN ./.
5/DT $/$ for/IN a/DT small/JJ fruit/NN cake/NN seems/VBZ a/DT bit/NN expensive/NN ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB argue/VB with/IN taste/JJ though/NN :/: delicious/JJ !/.
