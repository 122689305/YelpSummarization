Gross/NNP ./.
Pathetic/NNP ,/, really/RB ./.
Also/RB pathetic/JJ ,/, someone/NN from/IN the/DT kitchen/NN delivered/VBD food/NN to/TO another/DT patron/NN ./.
The/DT patron/NN asked/VBD a/DT question/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT kitchen/NN attendant/NN answered/VBD the/DT question/NN while/IN walking/NN away/RB ,/, making/VBG zero/NN eye/NN contact/NN ./.
Poor/JJ product/NN ./.
Poor/NN service/NN ./.
WOW/NNP ./.
Walked/NNP in/IN and/CC waited/VBD for/IN fifteen/VBN minutes/NNS and/CC never/RB got/VBD seated/VBN !/.
ON/NNP A/DT WEDNESDAY/NNP NIGHT/NNP ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB comprehend/VB how/WRB that/DT happens/NNS ./.
I/PRP recently/VBP returned/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT lite/NN dinner/NN with/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN after/IN a/DT year/NN plus/NN hiatus/NN ,/, well/RB let/VB me/PRP say/VB I/PRP should/MD have/VB returned/VBN sooner/NN !/.
The/DT new/JJ menu/NN is/VBZ well/RB worth/IN any/DT amount/NN of/IN waiting/JJ time/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP since/IN returned/NNP (/NNP apx/NN 4/CD days/NNS later/JJ )/NNS for/IN lunch/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD also/RB pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN ./.
The/DT new/JJ menu/NN provides/VBZ diverse/JJ options/NNS from/IN grilled/JJ salmon/NN ,/, shrimp/NN Thai/NNP salad/NN ,/, to/TO lamb/NN and/CC and/CC more/JJR ./.
All/DT plated/VBD wonderfully/RB to/TO please/VB the/DT eye/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT flavors/NNS did/VBD n't/RB disappoint/VB ./.
A/DT consistent/NN chain/NN with/IN a/DT menu/NN that/WDT leaves/NNS me/PRP with/IN many/JJ options/NNS that/WDT takes/VBZ me/PRP a/DT moment/NN or/CC two/CD to/TO decide/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ that/IN are/VBP colorful/JJ with/IN veggies/NNS and/CC so/RB many/JJ that/IN seem/NNP healthy/JJ ./.
This/DT pleases/VBZ me/PRP very/RB much/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD lunchtime/JJ and/CC they/PRP have/VBP specials/NNS in/IN which/WDT you/PRP can/MD choose/VB 2/NNS from/IN different/JJ categories/NNS for/IN prices/NNS by/IN category/NN ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD chose/NN that/IN option/NN and/CC had/VBD 1/2/CD a/DT grilled/JJ club/NN sandwich/NN and/CC a/DT chicken/NN Caesar/NN salad/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD the/DT crispy/NN chicken/NN salad/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD both/DT satisfied/VBN with/IN our/PRP$ choices/NNS and/CC finished/VBD every/DT bite/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, quality/NN of/IN food/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, prices/NNS were/VBD fair/RB ./.
Not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN big/JJ chains/NNS ./.
But/CC sometimes/RB you/PRP got/VBD ta/NN go/NNS with/IN the/DT flow/NN ./.
This/DT Applebee/NN 's/POS ,/, in/IN Penn/NNP Center/NNP ,/, is/VBZ crazy/JJ wicked/JJ busy/NN for/IN lunch/NN during/IN the/DT week/NN ./.
And/CC they/PRP are/VBP great/JJ at/IN moving/JJ people/NNS through/IN to/TO get/VB as/IN much/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ lunch/NN money/NN as/IN possible/JJ ./.
So/IN that/DT means/NN service/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB ever/RB gotten/VBN salads/NNS here/RB and/CC they/PRP have/VBP always/RB been/VBN flavorful/JJ and/CC as/IN presented/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ commercials/NNS and/CC menu/NN ./.
The/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP openly/RB support/VBP the/DT men/NNS and/CC women/NNS in/IN the/DT military/NN is/VBZ a/DT plus/NN for/IN me/PRP and/CC makes/VBZ me/PRP want/VBP to/TO support/VB this/DT chain/NN a/DT little/RB more/RBR ./.
Oh/NNP yes/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP also/RB support/VBP the/DT America/NNP 's/POS 911/CD MC/NNP ride/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD normally/RB give/VB three/CD stars/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT wait/NN and/CC service/NN was/VBD quick/JJ ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'll/MD round/VB it/PRP up/IN to/TO four/CD ./.
How/NNP hard/NNP is/VBZ it/PRP to/TO get/VB an/DT order/NN right/NN ?/.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP notified/VBN that/IN the/DT food/NN delivered/NN is/VBZ wrong/JJ ,/, is/VBZ it/PRP too/RB much/RB to/TO expect/VB an/DT apology/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB hear/VB ``/`` I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB actually/RB looked/VBN at/IN the/DT menu/NN ''/'' (/NN sly/RB look/JJ ,/, wink/NN ,/, wink/NN ,/, nod/VBD nod/JJ .../: like/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ some/DT funny/JJ inside/NN joke/NN )/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD passable/JJ ,/, my/JJ rack/NN of/IN ribs/NNS jammed/VBD onto/NN a/DT too/RB small/JJ rectangular/JJ plate/NN with/IN broccoli/NN and/CC the/DT wrong/JJ kind/NN of/IN fries/NNS (/VBP ordered/IN the/DT garlic/JJ fries/NNS ,/, not/RB plain/VB )/NN ,/, the/DT waitress/NN displayed/VBD not/RB a/DT care/NN that/IN the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD wrong/JJ ,/, and/CC quite/RB frankly/RB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB do/VB lem/NN me/PRP fix/VB it/PRP -/-NONE- get/VB it/PRP right/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN .../: that/DT is/VBZ your/JJ job/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB distracting/JJ and/CC obnoxious/JJ when/WRB customers/NNS are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO eat/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD very/RB slow/JJ considering/VBG my/PRP$ drink/NN order/NN was/VBD n't/RB even/RB taken/VB for/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS after/IN I/PRP was/VBD seated/VBN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD average/JJ for/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN restaurant.The/NN most/JJS distributing/JJ behavior/NN was/VBD when/WRB the/DT manager/NN corrected/VBD a/DT server/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP gone/VBN here/RB often/RB in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, today/NN 's/POS visit/NN will/MD be/VB our/VBN last/JJ visit/NN ./.

Not/RB the/DT best/JJS Applebees/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO but/CC not/RB the/DT worst/NN either/NN ./.
They/PRP seem/VBP to/TO have/VB some/DT strange/JJ policies/NNS in/IN place/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP order/VBP car/NN side/NN to/TO go/VB after/IN 8:00/CD they/PRP make/VBP you/PRP go/VB into/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB wo/VBP n't/RB seat/VB until/IN your/PRP$ entire/JJ party/NN is/VBZ there/RB even/RB if/IN your/PRP$ entire/NN party/NN is/VBZ two/CD people/NNS and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ fairly/RB empty/NN ./.

At/IN one/CD point/NN our/NN server/NN shouted/VBD over/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ to/TO the/DT bar/NN tender/NN about/IN something/NN ./.
I/PRP suppose/VBP that/IN sort/NN of/IN thing/NN happens/NNS when/WRB the/DT oldest/JJS employee/NN that/WDT evening/NN appered/VBD to/TO be/VB under/IN 30/CD years/NNS old/JJ ./.

Often/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB more/JJR then/RB once/RB for/IN either/DT more/RBR water/NN or/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN sauce/NN ./.

As/IN long/JJ as/IN you/PRP go/VBP expecting/VBG chain/NN restaurant/NN food/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB disappointed/VBN ./.
The/DT best/JJS deals/NNS are/VBP to/TO go/VB after/IN 9/NN and/CC get/VB half/DT off/NN of/IN a/DT nice/JJ selection/NN of/IN appetizers/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT end/NN I/PRP had/VBD a/DT plain/NN cheeseburger/NN without/IN bun/NN and/CC plain/NN sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.
Both/DT were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.

I/PRP stopped/VBD by/IN here/RB just/RB to/TO get/VB a/DT Caesar/NN salad/NN and/CC meet/NN my/NN sister/NN for/IN some/DT drinks/NNS ./.

By/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP got/VBD to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN my/NN sister/NN had/VBD already/RB ordered/VBN her/PRP meal/NN ./.
She/PRP got/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN and/CC rice/NN dish/VB which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD very/RB bland/JJ ./.
The/DT rice/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN pretty/RB well/RB and/CC the/DT shrimp/NN too/RB but/CC it/PRP just/RB tasted/VBD like/IN tomatoes/NNS nothing/NN special/NNS ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT Cesar/NNP side/NN salad/NN and/CC my/PRP$ hubby/NN got/VBD the/DT Blondie/NNP dessert/NN dish/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ I/PRP finished/VBP all/DT my/NN salad/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT small/JJ bite/NN of/IN his/PRP$ Blondie/NN which/WDT taste/NN like/IN a/DT vanilla/NN brownie/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB 9/JJ o'clock/NN yet/NN so/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB a/DT chance/NN to/TO take/VB advantage/NN of/IN the/DT discount/NN appetizers/NNS and/CC drinks/VBZ specials/NNS but/CC I/PRP still/RB managed/VBD to/TO order/NN me/IN a/DT long/JJ island/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN strong/JJ which/NNS is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP prefer/VBP but/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD a/DT lot/NN like/IN lemonade/NN as/IN opposed/JJ to/TO ice/NN tea/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP like/IN how/WRB they/PRP updated/VBD the/DT place/NN and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB have/VB any/DT bad/JJ things/NNS to/TO say/VB about/IN it/PRP but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT typical/JJ run-of-the-mill/NN chain/NN restaurant/NN ./.
most/JJS of/IN the/DT food/NN sometimes/RB does/VBZ taste/NN like/IN it/PRP came/VBD from/IN a/DT microwave/JJ package/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ what/WP you/PRP can/MD expect/VB from/IN a/DT chain/NN place/NN although/IN there/EX are/VBP some/DT better/RBR Applebee/NNP 's/POS but/CC this/DT one/CD just/NN happened/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT closest/NN to/TO my/PRP$ house/NN ./.
