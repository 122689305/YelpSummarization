This/DT ``/`` restaurant/NN ''/'' is/VBZ ,/, quite/RB possibly/RB ,/, the/DT worst/NN place/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN eaten/JJ -/NN and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP traveled/VBN through/IN Arkansas/NNP ,/, so/IN that/DT 's/VBZ saying/VBG something/NN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN was/VBD only/RB mildly/RB interested/JJ in/IN being/NNP there/NNP ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ dining/NN experience/NN only/RB went/VBD downhill/NN from/IN there/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD among/IN the/DT most/RBS mediocre/JJ I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN eaten/JJ ./.
The/DT BBQ/NNP sliders/NNS (/VBP dry/JJ pork/NN with/IN a/DT drop/NN or/CC two/CD of/IN sauce/NN and/CC some/DT cole/NN slaw/NN )/IN I/PRP got/VBD for/IN an/DT appetizer/NN were/VBD barely/RB appetizing/JJ ./.

The/DT accompanying/VBG beer-battered/JJ onion/NN rings/NNS were/VBD uninspiring/JJ ,/, as/IN were/VBD the/DT steak/JJ fries/NNS ./.
And/CC the/DT atmosphere/RB -/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB hard/JJ to/TO describe/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ ambitious/JJ and/CC has/VBZ some/DT potential/JJ -/NN but/CC it/PRP needs/VBZ people/NNS to/TO liven/VB it/PRP up/IN ./.
It/PRP wo/MD n't/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, get/JJ people/NNS with/IN the/DT lackluster/JJ food/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
Generally/RB ,/, the/DT place/NN seemed/VBD like/IN an/DT old/JJ adult/NN book/NN store/NN where/WRB someone/NN decided/VBD to/TO serve/VB food/NN ./.
Man/NNP ,/, this/DT place/NN sucks/NNS ./.

Our/NNP server/NN disappeared/VBD halfway/NN through/IN our/PRP$ dinner/NN ./.
Just/NNP as/IN bad/JJ experience/NN all/DT together/NN ./.
Its/PRP$ a/DT convenient/JJ place/NN because/IN its/PRP$ connected/JJ to/TO the/DT Best/NNP Western/NNP ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ overpriced/JJ ./.
