Been/NNP wanting/NN to/TO try/VB this/DT new/JJ place/NN out/IN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, my/NNS expectations/NNS were/VBD too/RB high/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP takoyaki/NN and/CC Tokyo/NNP rolls/NNS as/IN our/PRP$ appetizers/NNS ./.
The/DT takoyaki/NN were/VBD obviously/RB prepackaged/JJ ;/: more/JJR batter/NN and/CC little/JJ octopus/NNS ./.
The/DT Tokyo/NNP rolls/NNS were/VBD nothing/RB more/JJR than/IN egg/NN rolls/NNS which/WDT consisted/VBN more/RBR wrapper/JJR than/IN filling/NN ./.
Lighting/NNP in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD poor/JJ ,/, the/DT colored/VBN lights/NNS over/IN the/DT table/JJ made/NN it/PRP difficult/VBD to/TO see/VB your/PRP$ food/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT bento/NN box/NN with/IN steak/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD my/VBN steak/JJ medium/NN rare/NN ./.
At/IN least/JJS I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD medium/NN rare/NN ./.
(/NN Refer/NN to/TO said/VBD lighting/NN issues/NNS ./. )/''
The/DT wife/NN ordered/VBD hibachi/JJ chicken/NN and/CC ``/`` soba/NN ''/'' noodles/NNS ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD more/RBR like/IN General/NNP Tso/NNP than/IN hibachi/NNP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD expecting/VBG buckwheat/NN soba/NN noodles/NNS :/: what/WP we/PRP got/VBP was/VBD yaki-soba/JJ aka/NN ramen/VBN noodles/NNS ./.
We/PRP pointed/VBD out/RP to/TO the/DT waiter/NN that/IN real/JJ soba/NN is/VBZ made/VBN of/IN buckwheat/NN ./.
He/PRP insisted/VBD that/IN yaki-soba/NN is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ ./.
As/IN a/DT side/NN note/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD major/JJ stomach/NN issues/NNS after/IN eating/VBG here/RB ./.
Long/NNP story/NNP short/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT very/RB good/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, go/VB eat/JJ somewhere/RB else/RB ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN they/PRP food/service/VBP is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ Monday/NNP night/NNP around/IN 7/CD ,/, I/PRP tried/VBD to/TO call/VB them/PRP several/JJ times/NNS to/TO place/VB an/DT order/NN and/CC no/DT one/CD answer/NN the/DT phone/NN ./.
Too/NNP bad/NNP ,/, maybe/NN I/PRP will/MD update/VB my/JJ review/NN once/RB I/PRP actually/RB get/VBP to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
Ordered/IN a/DT take-out/NN for/IN a/DT Shrimp/NNP Teriyaki/NNP bento/NN box/NN ./.
The/DT price/NN was/VBD very/RB reasonable/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT amount/NN of/IN food/NN was/VBD great/JJ considering/VBG the/DT price/NN ./.
The/DT box/NN contained/VBD Sushi/NNP ,/, Shrimp/NNP Teriyaki/NNP ,/, Rice/NNP and/CC Miso/NNP soup/NN ./.
Tokyo/NNP Peking/NNP is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ Japanese/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT has/VBZ opened/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT southeastern/JJ region/NN of/IN Las/NNP Vegas/NNP ./.
It/PRP takes/VBZ the/DT place/NN of/IN a/DT pizza/NN place/NN ,/, and/CC before/IN that/DT ,/, a/DT mom/NN and/CC pop/NN buffet/NN ./.
So/IN far/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ located/VBN in/IN an/DT obscure/NN strip/NN mall/JJ off/NN of/IN Pyle/NNP ave/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ located/VBN in/IN a/DT quiet/JJ area/NN ./.
After/IN walking/NN inside/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD tell/VB that/IN they/PRP put/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN work/NN into/IN this/DT spot/NN ./.
The/DT sushi/NN bar/NN is/VBZ front/JJ and/CC center/NN ,/, with/IN some/DT smaller/JJR tables/NNS around/IN it/PRP ./.
Around/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ hibachi/NN tables/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB hip/JJ and/CC modern/JJ ./.
While/IN going/NN through/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD tell/VB that/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ going/VBG for/IN the/DT Osaka/NNP Japanese/NNP Bistro/NNP style/NN ./.
You/PRP can/MD order/VB combinations/NNS of/IN sushi/NN ,/, and/CC everything/NN is/VBZ by/IN piece/NN ,/, no/DT AYCE/NNP ./.
The/DT hibachi/NN tables/NNS in/IN the/DT back/NN provides/VBZ the/DT teppanyaki/NN for/IN those/DT that/NNS like/IN that/DT stuff/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP something/NN to/TO go/VB because/IN it/PRP was/VBD getting/VBG late/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT Japanese/JJ Combination/NN fried/VBD rice/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD cooked/VBN well/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT meat/NN and/CC seafood/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
I/PRP might/MD come/VB back/RB here/RB to/TO check/NN out/IN some/DT more/RBR stuff/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP some/DT interesting/JJ lunch/NN specials/NNS ./.
Pyle/NNP road/NN is/VBZ n't/RB too/RB busy/VB so/IN they/PRP might/MD need/VB some/DT social/JJ media/NNS presence/VBP to/TO help/VB them/PRP ./.
Wish/NNP them/VBD the/DT best/NN ./.
Everyone/NNP else/NN is/VBZ being/VBG wayyyyy/NN too/RB hard/RB on/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP come/VBN here/RB three/CD times/NNS since/IN they/PRP 've/VBP opened/VBN on/IN July/NNP 1st/CD and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ awesome/JJ ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ 10/10/CD ,/, 11/10/CD with/IN rice/NN ./.
Service/NNP and/CC staff/NNP are/VBP 20/10/CD certified/JJ ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP friendly/RB ,/, and/CC on/IN their/PRP$ feet/NN all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP ordered/VBN multiple/JJ things/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC they/PRP 've/VBP all/DT been/VBN good/JJ ,/, and/CC to-go/NN service/NN is/VBZ fast/RB too/RB ./.
It/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT shame/NN if/IN they/PRP go/VBP out/IN of/IN business/NN like/IN so/RB many/JJ other/JJ businesses/NNS in/IN this/DT plaza/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP surrounded/VBN by/IN plenty/NN of/IN homes/NNS ,/, so/IN it/PRP should/MD n't/RB be/VB too/RB hard/RB for/IN people/NNS to/TO just/RB walk/VB in/IN from/IN around/IN the/DT corner/NN ./.
