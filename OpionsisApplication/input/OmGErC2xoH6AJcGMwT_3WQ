pretty/RB average/JJ mexican/JJ food/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT large/JJ cantina/NN area/NN atttached/VBD that/IN becomes/VBZ a/DT club/NN of/IN sorts/NNS on/IN the/DT weekend/NN ./.
to/TO be/VB honest/RB ,/, i/NNP 've/NNP been/VBN here/RB three/CD times/NNS in/IN as/IN many/JJ years/NNS ./.
with/IN casa/NN reynosa/NN and/CC rosita/NN 's/POS so/RB close/JJ ,/, i/JJ tend/NN to/TO opt/NN for/IN them/PRP over/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Manuel/NNP 's/POS used/NN to/TO be/VB awesome/JJ ./.
Definitely/RB would/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT four/CD star/NN Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, something/NN changed/NN ./.
Ownership/NNP ,/, menu/NN ,/, service/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ bordering/VBG Garcia/NNP 's/POS territory/NN ,/, except/IN the/DT albondigas/NNS and/CC the/DT ribeye/NN steak/NN with/IN norteno/NN sauce/NN are/VBP still/RB pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT other/JJ day/NN my/NNS coworker/NN and/CC I/PRP attempted/VBD to/TO hit/VB up/RP El/NNP Buen/NNP Sabor/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ $/$ 0.99/CD taco/NN tuesday/NN special/JJ (/NN seeing/VBG a/DT theme/NN here/RB yet/RB ?/.
)/NN ,/, and/CC much/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ dismay/NN ,/, their/PRP$ doors/NNS were/VBD locked/VBN ,/, their/PRP$ menu/NN board/NN was/VBD down/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP appears/VBZ as/IN though/IN they/PRP have/VBP shut/VBN down/RB ./.
Since/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO drive/VB much/JJ further/NN ,/, he/PRP recommended/VBD we/PRP give/VBP Manuel/NNP 's/POS a/DT try/NN ,/, and/CC as/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB much/JJ of/IN a/DT choice/NN ,/, I/PRP agreed/VBD ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD tacos/NNS ,/, the/DT shredded/JJ beef/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ,/, however/RB the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD the/DT absolute/JJ WORST/NNP I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN as/RB long/JJ as/IN I/PRP can/MD remember/VB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD starving/VBG ,/, and/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB bring/VB myself/NN to/TO eat/VB more/JJR than/IN two/CD bites/NNS ./.
Very/NNP disappointing/NN .../: it/PRP takes/VBZ some/DT serious/JJ hard/NN work/NN and/CC effort/NN to/TO completely/RB f-up/JJ something/NN as/IN simple/JJ as/IN chicken/NN !/.
I/PRP filled/VBD up/RP on/IN chips/NNS and/CC salsa/NN ,/, which/WDT were/VBD decent/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP just/RB ca/VBP n't/RB get/VB over/IN the/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN ordeal/NN ./.
Not/RB to/TO mention/NN ,/, at/IN $/$ 15/CD after/IN tip/NN ,/, this/DT was/VBD no/DT bargain/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB making/VBG a/DT return/NN appearance/NN ./.
Pleasantly/RB surprised/VBD ./.
After/IN some/DT bad/JJ experiences/NNS at/IN a/DT North/NNP Phoenix/NNP Manuel/NNP 's/POS ,/, I/PRP had/VBD n't/RB tried/VBN another/DT one/CD in/IN years/NNS ./.
But/CC today/NN it/PRP was/VBD close/JJ and/CC well/RB .../:
I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ I/PRP went/VBD ./.
I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT table/JJ at/IN 1pm/CD -/JJ and/CC there/EX was/VBD only/RB other/JJ one/CD couple/NN in/IN eye/JJ shot/NN ./.
Part/NNP of/IN that/DT is/VBZ because/IN there/RB are/VBP lots/NNS of/IN little/JJ alcoves/NNS for/IN eating/JJ ,/, and/CC part/NN of/IN it/PRP is/VBZ because/IN they/PRP serve/VBP the/DT food/NN so/RB quickly/RB that/IN if/IN you/PRP got/VBD there/RB at/IN noon/NN you/PRP 're/VBP out/RP the/DT door/NN by/IN 1pm/CD easily/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP willing/JJ to/TO give/VB it/PRP that/IN excuse/NN because/IN both/DT the/DT service/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN were/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ./.
Their/NNP rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS are/VBP n't/RB anything/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB so/RB bad/JJ that/IN it/PRP took/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
My/NNP only/RB negative/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT could/MD be/VB why/VBN there/RB were/VBD fewer/JJR folks/NNS ,/, is/VBZ that/IN not/RB only/RB do/VB they/PRP have/VB a/DT pretty/RB limited/VBN lunch/NN menu/NN ,/, with/IN much/JJ smaller/JJR portions/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB really/RB ``/`` lunch/NN special/NN ''/'' prices/NNS ./.
Their/NNP lunch/NN menu/NN ran/VBD from/IN $/$ 7-10/CD with/IN most/JJS things/NNS $/$ 8-9/CD ./.
Considering/VBG the/DT full/JJ sized/JJ meals/NNS with/IN more/JJR options/NNS were/VBD available/JJ for/IN just/RB $/$ 1-/CD $/$ 2/CD more/CD ,/, why/CD not/RB get/VB the/DT larger/NN size/NN and/CC a/DT doggie/NN bag/NN for/IN dinner/NN ?/.
Not/RB a/DT bad/JJ spot/NN ,/, but/CC did/VBD n't/RB exactly/RB rock/VB my/PRP$ world/NN either/NN ./.
Ideally/RB -/JJ 3/NN 1/2/CD stars/NNS ./.
I/PRP happened/VBD to/TO visit/NN Manuel/NNP 's/POS yesterday/NN for/IN some/DT lunch/NN with/IN some/DT friends/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD never/RB gone/VBN before/RB ,/, but/CC thought/VBD I/PRP would/MD give/VB it/PRP a/DT try/NN ./.
Here/NNP 's/POS a/DT very/RB quick/JJ assessment/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN :/: atmosphere/RB :/: very/RB 70s/80s/CD -/JJ clearly/IN the/DT place/NN has/VBZ been/VBN here/RB a/DT while/NN ./.
service/NN :/: fair/NN ./.
nothing/NN stellar/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB terrible/JJ either/NN ./.
food/NN :/: also/RB fair/NN ,/, not/RB great/JJ but/CC not/RB bad/JJ ./.
price/NN :/: perhaps/RB a/DT bit/JJ overpriced/VBN for/IN the/DT quality/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB by/IN much/RB ./.
overall/JJ experience/NN :/: ok/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ consistently/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT cheapest/NN Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN around/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ also/RB of/IN a/DT higher/JJR quality/NN than/IN many/JJ ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ dishes/NNS are/VBP the/DT cheese/NN &/CC onion/NN enchiladas/NNS and/CC the/DT spinach/JJ enchiladas/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB tried/VBN anything/NN there/EX I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB enjoy/VB ./.
I/PRP am/VBP really/RB amused/VBN by/IN the/DT retro/NN ,/, deep/VB leather/NN booths/NNS they/PRP have/VBP ./.
They/PRP are/VBP really/RB comfortable/JJ ,/, but/CC sort/NN of/IN strange/JJ looking/NNS and/CC not/RB necessarily/RB what/WP you/PRP would/MD expect/VB to/TO see/VB in/IN a/DT Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP still/RB looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO the/DT visit/NN where/WRB I/PRP save/VBP room/NN for/IN dessert/NN !/.
Love/NNP the/DT bar/NN !/.
The/DT two/CD guys/NNS that/IN sing/JJ and/CC play/NN music/JJ there/EX Wed/VBN thru/NN Sat/NNP nights/NNS are/VBP just/RB amazing/VBG ./.
Manuels/NNS '/POS has/VBZ very/RB authentic/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN ./.
Best/NNP enchiladas/VBZ and/CC refried/VBD beans/NNS around/IN ./.
Bar/NNP is/VBZ adorable/JJ after/IN being/VBG renovated/VBN recently/RB ./.
Restaurant/JJ could/MD use/VB some/DT updating/NN ./.
OK/IN .../: I/PRP just/RB walked/VBD back/RB into/IN my/PRP$ hotel/NN room/NN after/IN a/DT meal/NN at/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP 'm/VBP being/VBG overly/RB generous/JJ by/IN even/RB giving/VBG them/PRP one/CD star/NN ./.
Fact/NNP of/IN the/DT matter/NN is/VBZ I/PRP had/VBD no/DT choice/NN but/CC to/TO give/VB them/PRP one/CD because/IN there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN lower/JJR ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT #/VBN 5/NN combination/NN which/WDT consisted/VBN of/IN one/CD cheese/NN enchilada/NN (/NN which/WDT was/VBD 1/100th/CD of/IN a/DT percent/JJ decent/NN )/NN ,/, one/CD shredded/VBD beef/NN hard/RB shell/JJ taco/NN (/NN which/WDT was/VBD perhaps/RB the/DT best/JJS thing/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC one/CD bean/JJ tostada/NN (/NN stale/NN tostada/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD an/DT overpriced/VBN (/NN $/$ 7.95/CD )/CD chile/NN relleno/NN a/DT la/NN carte/NN that/WDT tasted/VBN more/JJR like/IN an/DT ``/`` effen/NN ''/'' omelette/NN ./.
C'mon/NNP now/RB !/VBZ !/NNP !/.
The/DT consistency/NN of/IN the/DT egg/NN covering/VBG the/DT chile/NN relleno/NN should/MD be/VB fluffy/JJ and/CC quickly/RB fried/VBD ./.
This/DT thing/NN looked/VBD like/IN and/CC tasted/VBD as/IN if/IN they/PRP first/RB made/VBD an/DT Omelette/NNP and/CC then/RB wrapped/VBD it/PRP around/IN a/DT steamed/JJ chile/NN .../: .the/NN chile/NN was/VBD n't/RB even/RB fire/VB roasted/VBN !/-NONE- !/RB !/VBG !/.
Friends/NNS ,/, I/PRP know/VBP real/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN .../: .FINE/NNP Mexican/NNP food/NN for/IN that/DT matter/NN and/CC this/DT place/NN IS/NNPS NOT/NNP IT/NNP !/.
With/IN all/DT due/JJ respect/NN to/TO those/DT of/IN you/PRP who/WP have/VBP written/VBN rave/JJ reviews/NNS about/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN to/TO the/DT proprietors/NNS ,/, BUT/NNP I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP would/MD have/VB had/VBD a/DT much/JJ better/NN meal/NN at/IN the/DT nearest/JJS taco/NN bell/NN ,/, gladly/RB paying/VBD the/DT $/$ 25/CD bucks/NNS I/PRP laid/JJ down/NNS for/IN a/DT less/JJR than/IN mediocre/NN meal/NN ./.
My/NNP recommendation/NN to/TO you/PRP all/DT is/VBZ .../: ..DO/NNP N'T/NNP BOTHER/NNP ./.
They/PRP should/MD really/RB consider/VB dropping/VBG the/DT ``/`` FINE/NNP ''/'' from/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN this/DT establishment/NN ./.
On/IN a/DT good/JJ note/NN -/NN The/DT lady/NN tending/VBG bar/NN that/IN evening/NN was/VBD very/RB very/RB nice/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ .../: ./. unfortunately/RB the/DT service/NN alone/RB ca/MD n't/RB hold/VB this/DT place/NN up/RB ./.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN going/VBG to/TO this/DT Manuel/NNP 's/POS since/IN 1983/CD !/.
My/NNP baby/NN ate/NN cheese/NN crisp/NN &/CC green/JJ corn/NN tamales/NNS in/IN the/DT high/JJ chair/NN there/RB ./.
Guess/NNP what/NNP ,/, still/RB goes/VBZ there/RB for/IN the/DT same/JJ !/NN
The/DT green/JJ corn/NN tamales/NNS have/VBP n't/RB changed/VBN in/IN all/DT these/DT years/NNS ,/, still/RB great/JJ ./.
The/DT sampler/NN platter/NN is/VBZ awesome/NN ./.
The/DT margaritas/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ,/, not/RB watered/VBD down/RB like/IN some/DT places/NNS !/.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT chicken/NN chimis/NN ,/, seasoned/VBN wonderfully/RB ,/, not/RB just/RB meat/VB in/IN a/DT tortilla/NN ,/, like/IN many/JJ places/NNS !/.
The/DT flan/NN is/VBZ YUMMY/NNP !/.
So/RB are/VBP the/DT sopapillas/NNS !/VBP !/.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ ``/`` vintage/NN mexican/NN restaurant/NN ''/'' with/IN thick/NNP leather/NN booths/NNS and/CC hanging/VBG plants/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT bar/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/JJ area/NN with/IN sports/NNS on/IN the/DT tvs/NNS and/CC a/DT full/JJ separate/JJ bar/NN called/VBD Tiajuana/NNP Tilly's.he/NNP parking/NN can/MD be/VB touch/NN on/IN Friday/NNP &/CC Sat/NNP night/NNP ./.
Monday/NNP night/NN in/IN the/DT restuarant/NN they/PRP have/VBP 1/2/CD price/NN margaritas/NNS and/CC Tuesday/NNP is/VBZ kids/VBG eat/JJ FREE/NNP night-/JJ I/PRP think/VBP ?/.
Mine/NNP are/VBP grown/VBN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD this/DT busboy/NN 20/CD years/NNS ago/IN that/IN we/PRP dubbed/VBD ``/`` The/DT World/NNP 's/POS Greatest/NNP Busboy/NNP ''/'' because/IN he/PRP could/MD work/VB the/DT whole/JJ dining/NN room/NN and/CC you/PRP never/RB wanted/VBD for/IN anything/NN !/.

I/PRP hear/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ a/DT maitre/NN d/NN '/POS in/IN Phoenix/NNP now/RB ./.

We/PRP only/RB go/VBP when/WRB he/PRP is/VBZ working/VBG ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP go/VBP ,/, tell/VBP him/PRP Desertdoll/NNP sent/IN you/PRP !/.
