I/PRP love/VBP a/DT good/JJ hotdog/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD out/RP with/IN my/PRP$ son/NN and/CC we/PRP came/VBD across/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
It/PRP looks/VBZ like/IN a/DT new/JJ place/NN trying/VBG to/TO look/NNP old/NNP ./.

The/DT layout/NN reminded/VBD me/PRP a/DT lot/NN like/IN sonic/JJ and/CC the/DT drive/JJ ins/NNS back/RB when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD really/RB young/JJ ./.
The/DT interior/NN is/VBZ really/RB nice/JJ and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD they/PRP did/VBD a/DT great/JJ job/NN of/IN decorating/VBG ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Banzai/NNP dog/NN and/CC my/PRP$ son/NN ordered/VBD the/DT White/NNP hot/NN dog/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB decided/VBD to/TO get/VB a/DT large/JJ order/NN of/IN fries/NNS to/TO split/VB and/CC my/VB son/NN got/VBD a/DT root/NN beer/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD there/RB about/IN a/DT week/NN ago/IN and/CC my/PRP$ son/NN is/VBZ still/RB talking/VBG about/IN how/WRB magnificent/JJ the/DT root/NN beer/NN was/VBD ./.
He/PRP also/RB loved/VBD the/DT hot/NN dog/NN ,/, but/CC said/VBD it/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT little/JJ salty/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN the/DT banzai/NN dog/NN was/VBD also/RB fantastic/JJ ./.
The/DT banzai/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ really/RB what/WP makes/VBZ it/PRP ./.
You/PRP could/MD put/VB that/IN on/IN just/RB about/IN anything/NN and/CC make/VB it/PRP taste/RB good/JJ ./.

Whenever/NNP I/PRP order/VBP fries/NNS and/CC I/PRP see/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP fresh/JJ cut/NN fries/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ brain/NN automatically/RB thinks/VBZ Malt/NNP Vinegar/NNP ./.
I/PRP grabbed/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT containers/NNS and/CC took/VBD it/PRP back/RB to/TO our/PRP$ seat/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN along/IN the/DT windows/NNS so/RB when/WRB the/DT light/JJ hit/NN the/DT container/NN ,/, something/NN caught/NN my/NN eye/NN ./.
It/PRP looked/VBD like/IN there/NNS were/VBD 2-3/JJ ants/NNS floating/VBG in/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT container/NN ./.
I/PRP took/VBD the/DT container/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT counter/NN and/CC gave/VBD it/PRP to/TO the/DT person/NN there/RB and/CC showed/VBD them/PRP ,/, told/VBD them/PRP I/PRP thought/VBD they/PRP were/VBD ants/NNS ./.
Then/RB I/PRP noticed/VBD all/DT of/IN the/DT vinegar/NN containers/NNS had/VBD this/DT substance/NN in/IN them/PRP ./.
I/PRP went/VBD back/RB to/TO my/PRP$ seat/NN and/CC a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS later/JJ the/DT manager/NN shows/VBZ up/RP with/IN a/DT pan/JJ ,/, in/IN which/WDT she/PRP had/VBD poured/VBN out/RP the/DT vinegar/NN in/IN to/TO show/NN me/IN they/PRP were/VBD not/RB ants/RB ./.
She/PRP explained/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT fatty/NN spongy/NN substance/NN that/WDT collects/NNS in/IN vinegar/NN containers/NNS ./.
I/PRP told/VBD her/PRP that/IN I/PRP have/VBP several/JJ different/JJ vinegar/NN containers/NNS at/IN home/NN ,/, some/DT that/IN I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN for/IN 2+/CD years/NNS and/CC I/PRP have/VBP never/RB seen/VBN this/DT substance/NN ./.
I/PRP She/VBP said/VBN it/PRP is/VBZ common/JJ and/CC found/JJ it/PRP on/IN the/DT internet/NN ./.
So/IN of/IN course/NN I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT obvious/JJ question/NN ,/, ``/`` How/NNP long/NNP has/VBZ that/IN vinegar/NN been/NN in/IN those/DT containers/NNS that/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB this/DT fatty/NN spongy/NN substance/NN ?/. ''/''
She/PRP told/VBD me/PRP that/IN they/PRP empty/VBP them/PRP every/DT week/NN and/CC refill/NN them/PRP ./.
Now/RB ,/, I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP look/VBP like/IN I/PRP just/RB fell/VBD off/IN the/DT yam/NN wagon/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP hard/-NONE- to/TO believe/VB that/IN your/PRP$ vinegar/NN forms/NNS that/WDT in/IN a/DT week/NN and/CC mine/NN has/VBZ n't/RB in/IN over/IN 2/CD years/NNS ./.
My/NNP ten-year-old/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO ascertain/NN that/IN you/PRP were/VBD full/JJ of/IN crap/NN so/RB needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, your/PRP$ excuse/NN needs/NN work/NN ./.

Regardless/NN of/IN the/DT vinegar/NN incident/NN and/CC the/DT manager/NN clearly/RB trying/VBG to/TO cover/VB her/PRP ass/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT place/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD probably/RB return/VB again/RB if/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP will/MD skip/VB the/DT fries/NNS and/CC vinegar/NN ./.

At/IN one/CD point/NN i/NN counted/VBD 6/CD cars/NNS under/IN the/DT canopy/NN with/IN lights/NNS on/IN and/CC no/DT one/CD around/NN ./.
One/CD employee/NN stood/NN in/IN the/DT front/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN (/VBD apparently/RB on/IN break/NN )/NN just/RB looking/VBG at/IN all/PDT the/DT cars/NNS with/IN lights/NNS on/IN ./.

Overall/IN fantastic/JJ place/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ very/RB cool/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
Even/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB a/DT fan/JJ of/IN hot/NN dogs/NNS ,/, they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP burgers/NNS (/RB including/VBG a/DT black/NN bean/JJ burger/NN !/NN )/.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT original/JJ retro/NN dog-/NN diced/VBD onions/NNS ,/, chili/NN ,/, and/CC cheese/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ yummy/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT hint/NN of/IN cinnamon/NN in/IN the/DT chili/NN that/IN I/PRP could/MD have/VB done/VBN without/IN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB delicious/JJ !/.
My/NNP combo/NN also/RB came/VBD with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN home-style/JJ fries/NNS which/WDT were/VBD surprisingly/RB crunchy/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN tasty/NN ./.
Retro/NNP dog/NN also/RB offers/VBZ a/DT variety/NN of/IN retro/NN sodas-/JJ cream/NN soda/NN ,/, black/JJ cherry/NN ,/, root/NN beer/NN and/CC so/RB on/IN ./.
The/DT root/NN beer/NN is/VBZ actually/RB their/PRP$ own/JJ recipe/NN and/CC made/VBD locally/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT sweeter/JJ take/NN on/IN root/NN beer/NN than/IN most/JJS places/NNS ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP like/VBP sweet/JJ pop/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB a/DT fan/NN :/: )/JJ plus/NNS it/PRP comes/VBZ in/IN a/DT frosted/VBN mug/NN ,/, just/RB like/IN all/DT root/NN beer/NN should/MD !/VB

I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP will/MD be/VB going/VBG back/RB !/.
I/PRP recently/RB dined/VBD here/RB and/CC was/VBD very/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP dined/VBN at/IN many/JJ different/JJ hot/NN dog/NN establishments/NNS and/CC this/DT one/NN was/VBD overpriced/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD over/IN seasoned/VBN ,/, making/VBG them/PRP very/RB salty/JJ and/CC inedible/JJ ./.
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT snap/NN of/IN the/DT hot/NN dog/NN ,/, but/CC did/VBD n't/RB find/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT hot/NN dog/NN I/PRP would/MD throughly/RB enjoy/VB eating/JJ again/NNS ./.
I/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT float/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD ok/JJ but/CC I/PRP feel/VBP it/PRP was/VBD overpriced/VBN ./.
2/CD fries/NNS ,/, 1/CD hot/NN dog/NN ,/, 1/CD foot/NN long/RB and/CC 2/CD floats/NNS equated/VBD to/TO almost/RB $/$ 30/CD ./.
Sorry/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB coming/VBG back/RB ./.
Loved/NNP it/PRP since/IN it/PRP opened/VBD ./.
Everything/NNP 's/POS great/JJ but/CC be/VB sure/JJ to/TO ask/NN for/IN your/PRP$ dog/NN ungrilled/VBD if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB the/DT charring/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP it/PRP like/IN that/DT but/CC my/PRP$ kids/NN do/VBP n't/RB ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
The/DT hot/NN dogs/NNS are/VBP excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ./.
They/PRP seem/VBP like/IN decent/JJ people/NNS and/CC are/VBP friendly/RB ./.
My/NNP biggest/NNP complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT expensive/JJ side/NN ./.
We/PRP go/VBP here/RB fairly/RB regularly/RB ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO rate/NN my/NNS visit/NN as/IN a/DT 3/NN this/DT evening/NN (/VBD unfortunately/RB )/RB ./.
And/CC really/IN that/DT 's/VBZ pushing/VBG it/PRP ./.
The/DT hotdogs/NNS were/VBD excellent/JJ ;/: however/RB ,/, the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD over/IN salted/JJ and/CC oily/RB ,/, the/DT onion/NN rings/NNS were/VBD dripping/VBG in/IN grease/NN ./.
Very/NNP little/NNP onion/NN and/CC way/NN too/RB much/JJ batter/NN ./.
Please/NN ,/, please/NN change/NN your/NN oil/NN !/.
The/DT root/NN beer/NN floats/NNS -/JJ well/RB let/NNP 's/POS break/NN that/IN down/IN ;/: root/NN beer/NN was/VBD great/JJ but/CC the/DT custard/NN ice-cream/NN seemed/VBD to/TO have/VB ice/JJ chips/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
Not/RB creamy/NN ,/, but/CC ``/`` ice/NN milky/NN ''/'' ./.
Lastly/RB Retro/NNP Dog/NNP should/MD have/VB ``/`` Retro/NNP ''/'' music/JJ ./.
Stick/NNP with/IN the/DT dogs/NNS and/CC you/PRP may/MD enjoy/VB your/PRP$ visit/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB a/DT hot/NN dog/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD get/VB the/DT ice/NN cream/NN sandwich/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD give/VB just/RB the/DT ice/NN cream/NN sandwich/JJ five/CD stars/NNS !/.
The/DT butter/NN pecan/NN and/CC caramel/NN cookie/NN ice/NN cream/NN sandwich/NN was/VBD recommended/VBN to/TO me/PRP by/IN the/DT cashier/NN ./.
She/PRP did/VBD not/RB lead/VB me/PRP astray/VB ./.
Two/CD huge/JJ cookies/NNS with/IN ice/JJ cream/NN (/NN which/WDT was/VBD at/IN least/JJS 1.5/CD inches/NNS thick/JJ )/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB just/RB for/IN that/DT delightful/JJ treat/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD the/DT chocolate/NN malt/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB great/JJ ./.
Everything/NNP else/RB looked/VBD decent/NN in/IN the/DT pictures/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD not/RB partake/VB ./.
Retro/NNP Dog/NNP is/VBZ a/DT cool/NN place/NN to/TO stop/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP out/RP in/IN the/DT Cuyahoga/NNP Valley/NNP or/CC at/IN Blossom/NNP and/CC feel/NNP like/IN a/DT snack/NN or/CC some/DT ice/JJ cream/NN ./.
Kind/NNP of/IN separate/JJ from/IN anything/NN else/RB ,/, you/PRP will/MD see/VB a/DT large/JJ take/NN out/RP with/IN parking/VBG out/RP front/JJ where/WRB you/PRP can/MD have/VB the/DT food/NN brought/VBD out/RP to/TO your/PRP$ car/NN or/CC go/VB in/IN to/TO the/DT cool/NN dining/VBG area/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ bright/JJ and/CC in/IN your/PRP$ face/NN in/IN a/DT good/JJ way/NN ,/, kind/NN of/IN a/DT very/RB modern/JJ expression/NN of/IN a/DT 50/NN 's/POS diner/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN consists/NNS of/IN hot/NN dogs/NNS ,/, sandwiches/NNS ,/, sides/NNS and/CC plenty/NN of/IN ice/NN cream/NN based/VBN desserts/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN the/DT veggie/NN retro/NN dog/NN ,/, the/DT fries/NNS ,/, onion/NN rings/NNS and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN milk/NN shakes/NNS ,/, overall/VBD the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, not/RB great/JJ ./.
The/DT veggie/NN retro/NN dog/NN is/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB nice/JJ veggie/NN hot/NN dog/NN with/IN veggie/NN coney/NN sauce/NN ,/, mustard/NN and/CC onions/NNS on/IN a/DT wheat/JJ bun/NN ./.
The/DT mild/NN hot/NN dog/NN has/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ snap/NN but/CC it/PRP could/MD have/VB used/VBN more/JJR of/IN the/DT toppings/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT coney/NN sauce/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT mild/NN veggie/NN chili/NN ./.
The/DT french/NN fries/NNS are/VBP fresh/JJ cut/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD not/RB terribly/RB crisp/NN ./.
The/DT onion/NN rings/NNS missed/VBD the/DT mark/NN with/IN the/DT fried/VBN batter/NN overpowering/VBG the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT onions/NNS and/CC they/PRP seemed/VBD a/DT bit/NN overcooked/VBN ./.
The/DT 2/NN milkshakes/VBZ I/PRP tried/VBP were/VBD the/DT best/JJS items/NNS I/PRP had/VBD at/IN Retrodog/NNP ;/: prepared/NNP fresh/NN with/IN soft/JJ serve/JJ ice/NN cream/NN ./.
The/DT flavor/NN selection/NN is/VBZ extensive/JJ and/CC they/PRP have/VBP some/DT unique/JJ flavors/NNS for/IN you/PRP to/TO try/VB ./.
The/DT chocolate/NN banana/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ balance/NN of/IN the/DT banana/NN milk/NN shake/NN with/IN hot/NN fudge/NN ;/: the/DT salted/JJ caramel/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ balance/NN of/IN sweet/NN with/IN a/DT hint/NN of/IN salt/NN ./.
Overall/IN good/JJ shakes/NNS ,/, especially/RB using/VBG soft/NN serve/NN ice/NN cream/NN as/IN the/DT base/NN ./.
Retro/NNP Dog/NNP is/VBZ probably/RB not/RB worth/VB a/DT special/JJ trip/NN or/CC the/DT place/NN for/IN a/DT full/JJ meal/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN and/CC need/VBP a/DT snack/NN it/PRP is/VBZ worth/VBG a/DT try/NN ./.
The/DT Red/NNP Hot/NNP was/VBD very/RB soggy/JJ ./.
My/NNP bun/NN fell/VBD apart/NN ./.
The/DT Chicago/NNP Dog/NNP has/VBZ good/JJ flavor/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT wiener/NN was/VBD nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN ./.

It/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN everything/NN was/VBD just/RB a/DT little/JJ off/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Retro/NNP Dog/NNP and/CC onion/JJ rings/NNS and/CC the/DT hubs/NNS got/VBD the/DT Carolina/NN Dog/NNP with/IN fries/NNS ./.
The/DT hot/NN dog/NN itself/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ .../: Mellow/NNP taste/NNP ,/, nice/JJ snap/NN .../: but/CC the/DT coney/NN sauce/NN was/VBD a/DT turn/NN off/NN ./.
Very/NNP sweet/NN ,/, not/RB much/RB spice/VB ./.
My/NNP husband/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ Carolina/NN dog/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC he/PRP said/VBD he/PRP would/MD try/VB something/NN else/RB next/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT onion/NN rings/NNS really/RB had/VBD me/VBN excited/VBN because/IN they/PRP looked/VBD perfect/VB .../: they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB ./.
The/DT spices/NNS in/IN the/DT tempura/NN overwhelmed/VBN any/DT onion/NN flavor/NN that/WDT might/MD have/VB been/VBN there/RB and/CC they/PRP were/VBD SO/NNP GREASY/NNP !/.
I/PRP ate/VBP one/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN rings/NNS and/CC had/VBD to/TO stop/NNS ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD just/RB OK/IN too/RB and/CC needed/VBD to/TO have/VB salt/JJ added/NN to/TO them/PRP ./.
They/PRP had/VBD a/DT really/RB nice/JJ natural/JJ potato/NN flavor/NN but/CC they/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN they/PRP 'd/VBP been/VBN sitting/VBG around/IN for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, which/WDT seems/-NONE- implausible/JJ considering/VBG how/WRB busy/JJ they/PRP were/VBD ./.
We/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT root/NN beer/NN and/CC the/DT flavor/NN was/VBD not/RB unpleasant/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB flat/JJ ./.
Considering/NNP how/WRB very/RB sweet/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP could/MD have/VB used/VBN more/JJR carbonation/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO return/NN to/TO Retro/NNP Dog/NNP and/CC try/VBD a/DT dog/NN with/IN just/RB mustard/NN ./.

The/DT coney/NN sauce/NN was/VBD n't/RB very/RB good/JJ on/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN so/RB this/DT time/NN ordered/VBD our/PRP$ stuff/NN without/IN it/PRP which/WDT was/VBD much/JJ better/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT unusually/JJ warm/NN day/NN ,/, almost/RB 60/CD degrees/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD you/PRP need/VBP to/TO go/VB eat/NN at/IN a/DT drive-in/JJ and/CC take/VB in/IN the/DT balmy/NN day/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO Retro/NNP Dog/NNP once/RB ,/, not/RB long/RB after/IN it/PRP opened/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB impressed/VBN but/CC I/PRP thought/VBD give/VB it/PRP another/DT shot/NN ./.

He/PRP was/VBD very/RB apologetic/JJ ,/, but/CC come/RB on/IN ,/, he/PRP saw/VBD my/PRP$ lights/NNS on/IN as/IN did/JJ another/DT young/NN man/NN ./.
They/PRP took/VBD care/NN of/IN 3/CD other/JJ cars/NNS and/CC ignored/VBN me/PRP ./.
Anyway/NNP ,/, as/IN to/TO the/DT food/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ and/CC pricey/NN for/IN the/DT quality/NN ,/, $/$ 10.55/CD for/IN a/DT bacon/NN cheeseburger/NN ,/, small/JJ fries/NNS ,/, and/CC small/JJ Coke/NN ./.
Nothing/NN I/PRP could/MD n't/RB have/VB made/VBN at/IN home/NN better/NN ./.

Even/RB though/IN I/PRP planned/VBP my/JJ weekend/NN in/IN the/DT Akron/NNP area/NNP around/IN burger/JJR joints/NNS ,/, beer/NN and/CC baseball/NN ,/, I/PRP could/MD n't/RB pass/VB up/RP a/DT hot/NN dog/NN place/NN so/RB close/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ hotel/NN ./.

I/PRP debated/VBD the/DT growler/NN when/WRB I/PRP saw/VBP them/PRP on/IN the/DT counter/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP seemed/VBD a/DT bit/NN pricey/NN (/IN I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD $/$ 15/CD for/IN the/DT growler/NN full/NN of/IN root/NN beer/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP took/VBD my/PRP$ cup/NN and/CC dog/NN to/TO go/VB ,/, but/CC really/RB just/RB sat/JJ outside/NN at/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT tables/NNS since/IN it/PRP was/VBD such/JJ a/DT nice/JJ day/NN ./.
I/PRP unwrapped/VBD my/PRP$ dog/NN and/CC was/VBD surprised/VBN at/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ size/JJ -/JJ bigger/NN than/IN I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
This/DT was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB more/JJR than/IN a/DT snack/NN ./.

Though/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ it/PRP was/VBD the/DT best/JJS condiment/NN for/IN the/DT veggie/NN dog/NN ./.
The/DT root/NN beer/NN was/VBD aces/NNS ./.

The/DT veggie/NN chili/NN was/VBD also/RB a/DT bit/JJ dry/NN and/CC very/RB salty/JJ ./.
