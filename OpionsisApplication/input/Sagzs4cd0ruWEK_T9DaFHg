I/PRP was/VBD on/IN holiday/NN with/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD at/IN Edinburgh/NNP for/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN days/NNS doing/VBG tours/NNS ./.
We/PRP stumbled/VBD upon/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, what/WP a/DT happy/NN surprise/NN !/.
First/NNP time/NNP we/NNP came/NNP ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD packed/VBN ./.
The/DT server/NN told/VBD us/PRP it/PRP would/MD be/VB about/RB 10/CD or/CC 15/CD minutes/NNS ,/, she/PRP was/VBD closing/VBG a/DT ticket/NN and/CC they/PRP should/MD be/VB leaving/VBN soon/RB ./.
No/DT problem/NN ./.
She/PRP recommended/VBD that/IN we/PRP go/VBP two/CD doors/NNS down/IN at/IN Castle/NNP Arms/NNP for/IN a/DT drink/NN and/CC we/PRP thought/VBD why/VBN not/RB ./.
We/PRP returned/VBP and/CC the/DT table/JJ was/VBD ready/NN for/IN us/PRP ./.
Now/RB the/DT food/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN had/VBD the/DT haggis/NNS for/IN appetizer/NN and/CC supper/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD oyster/NN for/IN starter/NN and/CC fish/JJ for/IN supper/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT haggis/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD creamy/JJ and/CC good/JJ ./.
Delish/NNP !/.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT bottle/NN of/IN wine/NN and/CC shared/VBD a/DT pudding/VBG for/IN desert/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN came/VBD by/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ to/TO serve/VB us/PRP the/DT food/NN ./.
Server/NN says/VBZ he/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT hard/JJ worker/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD tell/VB he/PRP takes/VBZ pride/NN in/IN his/PRP$ restaurant/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD happy/JJ with/IN the/DT first/JJ visit/NN ,/, we/PRP came/VBD returned/IN the/DT next/JJ day/NN !/.
The/DT only/JJ con/NN i/NN could/MD think/VB of/IN is/VBZ the/DT toilet/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ only/RB 1/CD ladies/NNS room/NN ,/, and/CC on/IN the/DT second/JJ night/NN ,/, someone/NN took/VBD their/PRP$ time/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP ever/RB in/IN Edinburg/NNP again/RB ,/, I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB come/VB back/RB for/IN another/DT haggis/NN ./.
Bland/NNP overcooked/VBD overpriced../NN
The/DT overall/JJ 3/NN rating/NN is/VBZ too/RB generous/JJ ./.
I/PRP should/MD have/VB checked/VBN first/JJ before/IN I/PRP wandered/VBD into/IN this/DT dump/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD a/DT sad/JJ experience/NN ./.
The/DT entry/NN is/VBZ nicely/RB painted/VBN staircase/NN with/IN lively/RB graffitti/NN ./.
The/DT inside/NN looks/VBZ cozy/NN with/IN exposed/JJ brick/JJ walls/NNS and/CC wine/NN bottles/NNS with/IN dripping/JJ candles/NNS to/TO add/NNS to/TO the/DT ambiance/NN ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD to/TO eat/NN on/IN the/DT terrace/NN ./.
That/DT was/VBD probably/RB our/JJ mistake/NN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN did/VBD n't/RB came/VB back/RB after/IN we/PRP said/VBD we/PRP needed/VBD a/DT minute/NN ./.
The/DT guy/JJ waiting/NN on/IN us/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT chef/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN took/VBD a/DT while/NN to/TO come/VB out/RP and/CC then/RB was/VBD bland/JJ and/CC cold/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB though/IN ./.
Just/NNP wish/JJ it/PRP tasted/VBD as/RB good/JJ as/IN it/PRP looked/VBD ./.
I/PRP went/VBD to/TO Maxies/NNP Bistro/NNP -/NN with/IN so/RB many/JJ options/NNS ,/, I/PRP went/VBD there/RB because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ cleverly/JJ placed/NN sign/NN at/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT steps/NNS on/IN Victoria/NNP St/NNP which/WDT lured/VBN me/PRP upwards/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD open/JJ late/JJ one/CD night/NN in/IN Edinburgh/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD too/RB cold/JJ to/TO eat/NN in/IN the/DT Terrace/NN but/CC at/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT Terrace/NNP looked/VBD too/RB lonely/RB to/TO be/VB eating/VBG out/RP from/IN ./.
I/PRP sat/VBP at/IN a/DT cushy/JJ table/JJ near/IN the/DT bar/NN -/NN that/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN makes/VBZ me/PRP think/VBP of/IN Persia/NNP in/IN its/PRP$ glory/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ decidedly/RB Scottish/NNP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Tower/NN of/IN Haggis/NNP -/NNP an/DT arrangement/NN of/IN Haggis/NNP ,/, Neeps/NNP and/CC Tatties/NNP fancifully/RB arranged/VBD as/IN a/DT tower/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD quiet/JJ at/IN the/DT time/NN -/JJ just/RB me/PRP and/CC the/DT bartender/NN so/IN I/PRP sat/VBP back/RB and/CC relaxed/VBD and/CC paired/VBD it/PRP with/IN some/DT mulled/JJ wine/NN and/CC finished/NN with/IN a/DT great/JJ Berry/NNP Crumble/NNP dessert/NN ./.
Good/NNP value/NN ./.
Hurray/NNP for/IN free/JJ wi-fi/JJ access/NN as/IN well/RB !/.
Horrendous/NNP ./.
Truly/RB wolf/JJ dressed/VBN as/IN lamb/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN and/CC layout/NN were/VBD deceptively/RB nice/JJ ,/, but/CC please/NN do/VBP not/RB waste/VB your/PRP$ bills/NNS on/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD surly/RB and/CC only/RB attempted/VBD a/DT pleasantry/NN when/WRB bringing/JJ the/DT bill/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD standard/JJ if/IN not/RB completely/RB appalling/VBG (/IN some/DT had/VBD a/DT brown/VBN salad/NN ,/, others/NNS had/VBD meh/VBN 15/CD pound/NN lamb/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP had/VBD bland/JJ mushroom/NN pasta/NN that/WDT left/VBN me/NN in/IN the/DT bathroom/NN for/IN a/DT good/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN )/NN ./.
Plenty/NN of/IN other/JJ places/NNS in/IN this/DT fair/NN city/NN ./.
Worst/NNP steak/NN of/IN my/PRP$ life/NN !/NN !/VBD !/NNP !/.
Tasted/JJ like/IN it/PRP was/VBD made/VBN 2/CD weeks/NNS ago/IN then/RB microwaved/VBD a/DT week/NN ago/IN then/RB boiled/VBD in/IN bath/NN water/NN today/NN ./.
Cold/NNP as/IN hell/NN ./.
Garlic/NNP Sauce/NNP tasted/VBD like/IN watered/VBN shit/NN ./.
Never/NNP again/RB ./.
The/DT garlic/NN bread/NN was/VBD microwaved/VBN too/RB !/.
The/DT nice/JJ waitress/NN earned/VBD their/PRP$ one/CD star/NN for/IN refunding/NN my/NN money/NN
Stopped/NNP in/IN here/RB with/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN fellow/JJ traveler/NN 's/POS for/IN the/DT prix/NN fixe/NN lunch/NN before/IN heading/VBG up/RP the/DT road/NN to/TO the/DT castle/NN ./.
The/DT choices/NNS were/VBD actually/RB pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT garlic/JJ cheesebread/NN appetizer/NN ,/, salmon/JJ stuffed/JJ chicken/NN and/CC vegetables/NNS for/IN the/DT entree/NN and/CC a/DT piece/NN of/IN fudge/NN cake/NN for/IN the/DT dessert/NN ./.
The/DT garlic/NN cheesebread/NN was/VBD not/RB what/WP I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD served/VBN on/IN a/DT sliced/VBN piece/NN of/IN ciabatta/NN bread/JJ with/IN very/RB little/JJ melted/VBN cheddar/NN cheese/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD more/RBR like/IN eating/VBG toasted/VBN bread/JJ ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB find/VB a/DT hint/NN of/IN garlic/NN in/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG mozzarella/NN cheese/NN and/CC this/DT Italian/JJ sounding/VBG appetizer/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB what/WP I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG more/JJR along/IN the/DT lines/NNS of/IN an/DT Italian/JJ dunker/NN than/IN half/DT a/DT grilled/JJ cheese/NN sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT entree/NN was/VBD very/RB well/RB done/VBN ./.
Both/IN the/DT chicken/NN and/CC salmon/NN were/VBD superb/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN on/IN the/DT entree/NN was/VBD also/RB quite/JJ nice/NN ./.
The/DT vegetables/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/NN over/IN done/NNS and/CC were/VBD very/RB limp/JJ and/CC flavorless/JJ ./.
The/DT dessert/NN was/VBD also/RB very/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT waitress/NN made/VBD this/DT fun/NN for/IN us/PRP by/IN playing/NN a/DT goofy/NN birthday/NN song/JJ I/PRP 'd/MD never/RB heard/VB before/IN and/CC bringing/VBG out/RP a/DT piece/NN with/IN a/DT candle/NN in/IN it/PRP for/IN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ group/NN members/NNS who/WP had/VBD a/DT birthday/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP only/RB giving/RB this/DT 3/NN stars/NNS though/IN for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ value/NN ./.
At/IN 22/CD pounds/NNS without/IN beverage/NN (/NN almost/RB USD/IN $/$ 40/CD )/CD I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ small/JJ and/CC the/DT culinary/JJ value/NN did/VBD n't/RB quite/RB command/VB that/IN sort/NN of/IN price/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD included/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ trip/NN package/NN so/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB out/RB anything/VB out/IN of/IN pocket/NN really/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB recommend/VB it/PRP to/TO someone/VB else/RB unless/IN it/PRP were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ cheaper/NN ./.
Nice/NNP little/VBD place/NN though/IN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP quickly/RB ./.
Maybe/NNP other/JJ dishes/NNS would/MD be/VB better/RBR and/CC priced/VB more/RBR appropriately/RB ./.
Over/IN all/PDT the/DT visits/NNS I/PRP had/VBD here/RB (/VBN about/IN once/RB a/DT year/NN since/IN 2010/CD )/CD I/PRP think/VBP that/IN 2/CD star/NN is/VBZ about/RB as/RB much/JJ as/IN it/PRP deserves/VBZ ./.
That/DT is/VBZ NOT/NNP for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, nor/CC for/IN the/DT ambiance/NN -/JJ both/NNS are/VBP seriously/RB lacking/VBG in/IN class/NN ,/, depth/NN and/CC flavour/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ few/JJ visits/NNS we/PRP tried/VBD some/DT food/NN (/NN notice/NN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB use/VB the/DT phrase/NN ``/`` we/PRP had/VBD a/DT meal/NN ''/'' )/NN Nope/NNP ,/, my/NNP 2/NNP stars/NNS go/VBP to/TO A/DT ./.
Location/NNP ./.
They/PRP are/VBP a/DT in/IN brilliant/JJ out/NN of/IN the/DT way/NN suntrap/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN ./.
Sit/NNP outside/NNP and/CC enjoy/VB the/DT scenery/NN ./.
Definitely/RB worth/VBD a/DT star/NN B/NN ./.
Service/NNP ./.
(/IN not/RB the/DT cooking/NN !/NN )/.
Their/NNP front/NN of/IN house/NNS are/VBP really/RB nice/JJ and/CC the/DT amount/NN of/IN unhappy/JJ customers/NNS must/MD really/RB wear/VB them/PRP down/IN ./.
I/PRP actually/RB feel/VBP sorry/JJ for/IN them/PRP ./.
This/DT ,/, my/PRP$ friends/NNS ,/, is/VBZ what/WP you/PRP show/VBP visitors/NNS so/IN they/PRP know/VBP what/WP to/TO avoid/NNS for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN their/PRP$ stay/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT tourist/NN trap/NN ./.
I/PRP certainly/VBP hope/JJ to/TO see/VB a/DT 'New/NN Kitchen/NNP Manager/NNP '/POS banner/NN here/RB rather/RB sooner/JJR than/IN later/JJ ./.
That/DT may/MD entice/VB me/PRP to/TO visit/NN again/RB ./.
Maybe/NNP ./.
Though/NNP I/PRP am/VBP a/DT possibly/RB a/DT sucker/NN to/TO go/VB here/RB once/RB a/DT year/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN to/TO see/VB any/DT kind/NN of/IN change/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made../NN only/RB to/TO be/VB disappointed/VBN ./.
Maybe/NNP next/JJ time/NN
Maxies/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB look/VB much/RB from/IN the/DT outside/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO be/VB honest/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB up/RB to/TO all/DT that/IN much/JJ inside/NN either/NN ./.
Situated/NNP just/RB round/VBD the/DT corner/NN from/IN the/DT Royal/NNP Mile/NNP ,/, Maxies/NNP is/VBZ right/RB behind/IN Edinburgh/NNP Castle/NNP and/CC so/IN it/PRP ought/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT great/JJ restaurant/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT tourists/NNS to/TO go/VB ,/, but/CC unfortunately/RB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB up/RB to/TO much/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN has/VBZ quite/RB a/DT cosy/JJ feel/NN inside/NN with/IN padded/JJ seats/NNS covered/VBD in/IN cushions/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT pretty/JJ lively/NN atmosphere/RB ./.
The/DT menu/NN in/IN Maxies/NNP is/VBZ pretty/RB much/JJ seafood/NN orientated/VBN ,/, with/IN lots/NNS of/IN fish/JJ and/CC seafood/JJ dishes/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP also/RB steaks/VBZ ,/, stir/JJ fry/NN 's/POS ,/, chicken/NN and/CC haggis/VBZ dishes/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN too/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT sole/JJ cooked/NN in/IN a/DT creamy/NN sauce/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD OK/NNP ./.
The/DT sauce/NN was/VBD pretty/RB thick/JJ and/CC gloopy/JJ and/CC lacked/JJ proper/NN taste/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT fish/NN was/VBD perfectly/RB cooked/VBN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN had/VBD a/DT pasta/NN dish/VB which/WDT they/PRP really/RB did/VBD n't/RB like/VB ,/, she/PRP said/VBD the/DT pasta/NN was/VBD still/RB hard/JJ and/CC that/IN the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD tepid/JJ -/JJ not/RB nice/RB ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD pretty/RB average/JJ too/RB ,/, the/DT waiter/NN 's/POS were/VBD n't/RB that/IN attentive/JJ and/CC only/RB seemed/VBD to/TO show/VB some/DT life/NN when/WRB we/PRP asked/VBP for/IN the/DT bill/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP much/JJ better/NN restaurants/NNS in/IN Edinburgh/NNP which/WDT are/VBP more/JJR deserving/NN of/IN the/DT custom/NN than/IN Maxies/NNPS ./.
Let/NNP me/NNP first/JJ say/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD wearied/VBN ,/, hungry/JJ and/CC circled/VBD the/DT town/NN several/JJ times/NNS before/IN stopping/JJ here/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD late/JJ and/CC most/RBS Edinburgh/JJ restaurants/NNS stop/VBP serving/VBG dinner/NN at/IN 10/CD PM/NNP ./.
We/PRP snuck/VBP in/IN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD close/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ fantastic/JJ hotel/NN -/JJ Missoni/NNP ./.
So/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD no/DT great/JJ shakes/NNS but/CC not/RB as/RB horrible/JJ as/IN other/JJ reviewers/NNS write/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD poached/VBN salmon/JJ with/IN boiled/JJ veggies/NNS and/CC man/NN had/VBD spicy/JJ chicken/VBN something/NN ./.
Both/DT good/JJ and/CC not/RB overpowering/VBG for/IN a/DT late/JJ night/NN meal/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT bottle/NN of/IN the/DT Maxie/NNP 's/POS house/NN red/VBD ./.
Good/NNP for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
The/DT interior/NN was/VBD small/JJ ans/NNS quaint/NN ;/: a/DT little/JJ stone-walled/JJ ,/, candle-lit/JJ room/NN with/IN a/DT medieval/NN charm/NN ./.
Nice/NNP terrace/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
What/WP really/RB stood/VBD out/RP was/VBD the/DT service/NN ./.
Sweet/NNP little/VBD cherubs/NNS served/VBN us/PRP with/IN smiles/NNS and/CC willingly/RB provided/VBN tips/NNS for/IN fun/JJ stuff/NN to/TO do/VB during/IN our/PRP$ stay/NN ./.
We/PRP hung/VBP quite/JJ awhile/NN and/CC relaxed/VBD ,/, chatting/VBG with/IN the/DT staff/NN and/CC other/JJ guests/NNS ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB for/IN late-night/JJ meals/NNS after/IN a/DT long/JJ day/NN of/IN travel/NN or/CC sunny/NN terrace/NN pint/NN stops/NNS ./.
We/PRP 're/VBP told/VBG it/PRP rains/VBZ more/JJR than/IN not/RB in/IN Edinburgh/NNP so/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT shot/NN on/IN a/DT sunny/JJ day/NN ./.
Staff/NNP easily/VBD gets/NNS 5/IN stars/NNS ,/, ambiance/NN 4/NN stars/NNS ,/, food/NN 3/NN ./.
Last/JJ note/NN -/JJ one/CD of/IN the/DT sweet/JJ cherubs/NNS tried/VBD to/TO tell/NN us/PRP we/PRP gave/VBD too/RB much/JJ money/NN ,/, to/TO which/WDT we/PRP replied/VBD ,/, nope/JJ we/PRP thoroughly/RB enjoyed/VBN it/PRP ./.
Cheers/NNP !/.
Initially/RB very/RB impressed/VBN by/IN the/DT place/NN ,/, but/CC then/RB turned/VBD into/IN an/DT average/JJ experience/NN in/IN the/DT end/NN ./.
You/PRP come/VBP down/RB into/IN a/DT lovely/RB cave/JJ like/IN place/NN with/IN nice/JJ moody/NN lighting/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN not/RB particularly/RB friendly/RB and/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD too/RB cold/JJ so/IN I/PRP had/VBD my/VBN jacket/NN on/IN the/DT whole/JJ time/NN ./.
Certainly/RB can/MD not/RB fault/VB the/DT speed/NN of/IN the/DT arrival/NN of/IN food/NN .../: ..probably/RB arriving/VBG worryingly/RB fast/RB for/IN what/WP we/PRP had/VBD ./.
Hoping/NNP it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB microwaved/VBN !/.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, an/DT okay/NN place/NN but/CC absolutely/RB nothing/NN to/TO shout/NN about/IN unfortunately/RB ./.
I/PRP came/VBD for/IN the/DT sun/NN ,/, I/PRP stayed/VBD for/IN some/DT food/NN and/CC both/DT were/VBD really/RB rather/RB nice/JJ ./.
Had/NNP it/PRP not/RB been/VBN a/DT super/NN ,/, super/NN sunny/NN and/CC hot/NN day/NN ,/, and/CC had/VBD I/PRP not/RB been/VBN looking/VBG for/IN an/DT outdoor/NN place/NN to/TO eat/VB ,/, drink/VBP and/CC soak/VB up/RP the/DT rays/NNS (/VBP I/PRP shall/MD defeat/VB rickets/NNS yet/RB !/VBP )/.
I/PRP may/MD not/RB have/VB come/VBN to/TO Maxie/NNP 's/POS ./.
But/CC with/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ prime/JJ location/NN on/IN Johnstone/NNP Terrace/NNP ,/, overlooking/VBG Victoria/NNP Street/NNP and/CC the/DT Grassmarket/NNP ,/, it/PRP got/VBD ALL/NNP the/DT sunshine/NN and/CC did/VBD some/DT quite/JJ nice/NN pub/NN grub/NN to/TO boot/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ old/JJ fashioned/VBN British/JJ pub/NN grub/NN ./.
Not/RB nouveau/JJ gasto-pub/NN posh/NN burgers/NNS with/IN portobello/NN mushrooms/NNS and/CC haloumi/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT sort/NN of/IN pub/NN grub/NN I/PRP ate/VBP as/IN wee/NN girl/NN at/IN our/PRP$ local/JJ smiddy/NN pub/NN ./.
Which/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ in/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ own/JJ right/NN ./.

Nice/NNP even/RB ./.
The/DT chicken/NN enchillada/NN on/IN the/DT left/NN of/IN me/PRP looked/VBD really/RB quite/RB good/JJ ,/, lots/NNS of/IN chicken/NN ,/, fresh/JJ ingredients/NNS and/CC not/RB too/RB cheesy/JJ ./.
But/CC pub/VBP grub/JJ food/NN is/VBZ as/IN pub/NN grub/NN food/NN does/VBZ ./.
No/DT bells/NNS and/CC whistles/NNS ,/, but/CC still/RB good/JJ quality/NN for/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
The/DT next/JJ time/NN the/DT suns/NNS out/IN I/PRP 'd/MD happily/RB bob/VB down/RP here/RB for/IN another/DT drink/NN and/CC bite/JJ to/TO eat/NN ./.
Scottish/NNP tan/NNP (/NNP roughly/RB lobster/JJR red/VBN )/NN comes/VBZ as/IN standard/NN ./.
Un/IN tres/NNS bel/NN endroit/NN ,/, tant/JJ par/NN sa/NN situation/NN que/JJ par/NN son/NN décor/NN !/.

The/DT best/JJS thing/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ probably/RB how/WRB it/PRP looks/VBZ .../: which/WDT is/VBZ never/RB a/DT great/JJ thing/NN to/TO write/VB about/IN a/DT restaurant/pub/bistro/NN -/JJ I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB really/RB sure/JJ which/WDT one/CD this/DT place/NN is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD too/RB pricey/JJ to/TO be/VB classed/VBN as/IN a/DT gastro-pub/NN sort/NN of/IN place/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD n't/RB really/RB restaurant/VB standard/JJ ,/, nor/CC was/VBD the/DT service/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB terrible/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT what/NN you/PRP pay/VBP and/CC what/WP you/PRP get/VBP do/VBP n't/RB quite/RB tally/RB up/IN somehow/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB you/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN such/JJ amazing/VBG places/NNS earby/JJ like/IN the/DT Grain/NNP Store/NNP or/CC Maison/NNP Bleue/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB above/IN Victoria/NNP Street/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT hill/NN stretching/VBG up/RP to/TO the/DT castle/NN ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP get/VBP a/DT table/JJ on/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ little/JJ outdoor/NN terrace/NN in/IN the/DT sun/NN then/RB you/PRP may/MD as/RB well/RB just/RB write/JJ off/IN any/DT constructive/NN plans/NNS you/PRP may/MD have/VB had/VBN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, because/IN I/PRP can/MD safely/RB say/VB you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB sipping/VBG something/NN cold/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT afternoon/NN ./.

i/NN hate/NN to/TO give/VB them/PRP a/DT bad/JJ review/NN because/IN our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD so/RB nice/JJ .../: .but/NN ,/, my/PRP$ allegiance/NN to/TO the/DT YELP/NNP community/NN must/MD persevere/VB !/.
This/DT was/VBD a/DT crappy/NN restaurant/NN ./.
But/CC ,/, it/PRP was/VBD walking/VBG distance/NN from/IN our/PRP$ apartment/NN and/CC my/PRP$ mother-in-law/NN wanted/VBD something/NN close/NN ./.
Arghhhh/NNP ./.
The/DT drinks/NNS were/VBD warm/NN (/IN yes/NNS ,/, I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN Scotland/NNP .../: .but/NN ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP from/IN the/DT US/NNP where/WRB we/PRP serve/VBP cold/JJ drinks/NNS )/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD mediocre/RB ./.
Had/IN the/DT shrimp/NN stir/NN fry/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB bland/JJ ./.
The/DT only/RB good/JJ thing/NN was/VBD the/DT price/NN and/CC the/DT nice/JJ waiter/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB waste/VB your/PRP$ money/NN ./.
I/PRP lost/VBD my/PRP$ pounds/NNS so/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO ./.
Came/NN here/RB with/IN my/NNP family/NN during/IN my/PRP$ wedding/NN weekend/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD extremely/RB friendly/RB and/CC accommodating/VBG seeing/NN as/IN every/DT other/JJ restaurant/NN nearby/NN was/VBD extremely/RB busy/JJ and/CC had/VBD no/DT room/NN for/IN our/PRP$ large/JJ party/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT chicken/NN entree/NN which/WDT was/VBD extremely/RB tasty/JJ ./.
The/DT rest/NN of/IN my/NNP family/NN all/DT ordered/NN various/JJ items/NNS off/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC everyone/NN agreed/VBD that/IN our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Good/NNP food/NN and/CC great/JJ service/NN is/VBZ all/DT I/PRP need/VBP when/WRB I/PRP visit/VBP a/DT restaurant/NN and/CC this/DT place/NN delivered/NN ./.
Dinner/NNP ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD fantastic/JJ food/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD starters/NNS and/CC mains/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP were/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
The/DT mussels/NNS were/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS ones/NNS I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN eaten/JJ ./.
The/DT salmon/NN came/VBD next/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/NN ./.
My/NNP company/NN ate/NN salad/JJ ,/, fajitas/NNS and/CC chicken/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP were/VBD all/DT very/JJ pleased/JJ and/CC happy/JJ ./.
The/DT interior/NN is/VBZ picturesque/NN and/CC warmingly/RB welcome/JJ ./.
The/DT staff/NN would/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT hold/NN of/IN ,/, as/IN they/PRP frequently/VBP rushed/VBN by/IN or/CC looked/VBD in/IN the/DT other/JJ direction/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT toilets/NNS were/VBD small/JJ and/CC not/RB so/RB nice/RB ./.
But/CC the/DT food/NN will/MD make/VB me/PRP go/VB back/RB there/RB again/RB and/CC again/RB ./.
I/PRP used/VBD to/TO love/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS back/RB so/RB when/WRB Ms/NNP Susie/NNP suggested/VBD it/PRP for/IN a/DT quick/JJ bite/NN to/TO eat/VB last/JJ night/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD excited/VBN to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB quiet/JJ compared/VBN to/TO its/PRP$ neighbours/NNS but/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB let/VB that/DT put/NN us/VBD off/RP ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP should/MD 've/VB been/VBN a/DT warning/NN ./.
Susie/NNP had/VBD the/DT chicken/VBN enchilada/NN &/CC I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT tower/NN of/IN haggis/NNS ,/, neeps/NNS &/CC tatties/NNS ,/, a/DT real/JJ winter/NN warmer/NN ./.
The/DT plates/NNS arrived/VBD &/CC the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD generous/JJ ./.
Well/NNP the/DT haggis/NNP &/CC tatties/NNS were/VBD ,/, the/DT neeps/NNS were/VBD almost/RB non-existent/JJ ./.
The/DT tatties/NNS looked/VBD as/IN though/IN they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN toasted/VBN under/IN the/DT grill/NN but/CC in/IN fact/NN the/DT dish/JJ must/NN 've/VBP been/VBN keep/JJ warm/NN in/IN the/DT oven/NN as/IN both/DT the/DT tatties/NNS &/CC haggis/NNS were/VBD dried/VBN out/RP ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD to/TO eat/VB some/DT from/IN the/DT middle/JJ but/CC it/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB doing/VB it/PRP for/IN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP can/MD not/RB fault/VB the/DT service/NN ./.
As/IN soon/RB as/IN I/PRP told/VBD the/DT waitress/NN she/PRP offered/VBD me/PRP something/NN else/RB from/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
By/IN then/RB I/PRP 'd/MD lost/VB my/NN appetite/NN so/IN they/PRP took/VBD it/PRP off/IN the/DT bill/NN ./.
Shortly/RB after/IN the/DT chap/NN at/IN the/DT next/JJ table/JJ also/RB complained/VBD ./.
He/PRP though/VBD his/PRP$ breaded/JJ mushrooms/NNS were/VBD going/VBG to/TO break/VB his/PRP$ teeth/NN !/NN !/.
Susie/NNP 's/POS enchilada/NN was/VBD definitely/RB the/DT better/NN choice/NN ./.
Overall/IN I/PRP would/MD 've/VB given/VBN 2/CD stars/NNS but/CC for/IN the/DT decent/NN service/NN which/WDT gets/NNS it/PRP three/CD stars/NNS ./.
I/PRP may/MD go/VB back/RB but/CC when/WRB there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT wealth/NN of/IN competition/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ better/JJR be/VB good/JJ next/JJ time/NN ./.
Excellent/NNP with/IN outdoor/NN seating/VBG ./.
Had/IN the/DT haggis/NN appetizer/NN and/CC fish/JJ and/CC chips/NNS !/.
Great/NNP food/NN ,/, great/JJ view/NN ,/, great/JJ service/NN ./.
Décor/NNP atypique/VBD et/JJ haut/NN en/VBN couleur/NN ./.
Des/NNP viandes/VBZ très/NNS bien/VBN cuites/NNS et/VB très/NNS tendres/NNS mais/VBZ des/VBZ portions/NNS un/JJ peu/NN juste/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD just/RB come/VBN from/IN a/DT horribly/RB serviced/VBN restaurant/NN and/CC when/WRB we/PRP came/VBD to/TO Maxie/NNP 's/POS everything/NN was/VBD a/DT lot/NN better/RBR ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD a/DT young/JJ man/NN and/CC despite/NN having/VBD a/DT lot/NN to/TO do/VB (/RB practically/RB serving/VBG everyone/NN )/IN he/PRP was/VBD super/NN helpful/JJ and/CC nice/JJ and/CC always/RB had/VBD a/DT smile/NN on/IN his/PRP$ face/NN ./.
Very/NNP pleased/VBD with/IN the/DT food/NN as/RB well/RB it/PRP was/VBD all/DT very/RB good/JJ and/CC had/VBD many/JJ selections/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
The/DT only/JJ negative/JJ I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ the/DT set/NN up/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD so/RB crowded/VBN up/RP there/RB the/DT restaurants/NNS were/VBD split/VBN up/RP outside/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD weird/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO get/VB around/IN that/DT and/CC is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ worth/IN it/PRP ./.
We/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN for/IN a/DT snack/NN and/CC to/TO warm/VB up/RP on/IN a/DT rainy/NN November/NN day/NN in/IN early/JJ afternoon/NN and/CC had/VBD a/DT very/RB pleasant/JJ experience/NN sitting/VBG in/IN the/DT small/JJ lounge/NN bar/NN area/NN ./.
Only/IN a/DT few/JJ other/JJ people/NNS were/VBD there/RB ,/, the/DT hot/NN ,/, mulled/VBD wine/NN hit/VBD the/DT spot/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ snacks/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN ./.
We/PRP saw/VBD the/DT sign/NN that/IN mentions/NNS they/PRP have/VBP good/JJ fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS cooked/VBD to/TO order/NN so/IN we/PRP thought/VBP why/VBN not/RB try/VB some/DT classic/JJ uk/NN fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS like/IN we/PRP hear/JJ about/IN on/IN television/NN ./.
The/DT batter/NN was/VBD not/RB salted/VBN or/CC seasoned/VBN so/RB there/RB was/VBD zero/NNP flavour/NN ,/, the/DT fish/JJ they/PRP used/VBP had/VBD no/DT flavour/NN to/TO speak/NN of/IN ./.
The/DT temp/NN on/IN the/DT fryer/NN must/MD have/VB been/VBN too/RB low/JJ because/IN the/DT batter/NN was/VBD very/RB greasy/JJ and/CC it/PRP soaked/VBD right/NN through/IN into/IN the/DT fish/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.
Maybe/NNP they/PRP are/VBP famous/JJ for/IN something/NN else/RB but/CC they/PRP have/VBP no/DT business/NN selling/VBG fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS
Excellent/NNP location/NN with/IN good/JJ food/NN and/CC excellent/JJ service/NN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD into/IN this/DT place/NN after/IN walking/VBG around/IN Edinburgh/NNP ,/, site-seeing/JJ and/CC shopping/JJ ./.
I/PRP passed/VBD by/IN this/DT little/JJ place/NN the/DT day/NN before/IN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC try/RB it/PRP out/IN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT cozy/JJ little/JJ place/NN ,/, warm/NN and/CC comfortable/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN from/IN the/DT door/NN and/CC seated/VBN immediately/RB ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN couple/NN of/IN appetizers/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT infused/VBN game/NN pate/NN and/CC grilled/VBD brie/JJ ,/, and/CC for/IN main/JJ dish/JJ I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT steak/NN with/IN black/JJ pudding/VBG and/CC my/VBG friend/NN ordered/IN the/DT sauteed/JJ chicken/NN in/IN red/VBN pepper/NN sauce/NN ./.
Both/DT of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD well/RB prepared/VBN ./.
The/DT steak/NN and/CC the/DT black/NN pudding/VBG just/RB hit/IN the/DT spot/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB tried/VBD my/NNP friend/NN 's/POS chicken/NN and/CC I/PRP loved/VBD that/IN red/VBN pepper/NN sauce/NN ./.
Veggies/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ plain/NN and/CC maybe/VB a/DT little/JJ over/NN cooked/VBD but/CC the/DT dinner/NN was/VBD enjoyable/JJ and/CC was/VBD fully/RB completed/VBN with/IN the/DT great/JJ service/NN we/PRP got/VBD from/IN the/DT woman/NN working/NN at/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/JJ if/IN she/PRP was/VBD the/DT manager/NN or/CC not/RB ./.
But/CC she/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ polite/NNS and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD love/VB to/TO come/VB here/RB in/IN summer/NN and/CC dine/VB out/RP on/IN the/DT patio/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ such/VBN a/DT nice/NN and/CC unique/JJ view/NN .../:
Good/NNP location/NN ,/, nice/JJ decor/NN ,/, nice/JJ staff/NN ,/, terrible/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP ate/VBP here/RB recently/RB and/CC was/VBD decidedly/RB disappointed/JJ ;/: from/IN the/DT menu/NN it/PRP looked/VBD as/IN though/IN the/DT food/NN would/MD be/VB lovely/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD smoked/VBN salmon/JJ and/CC cream/NN cheese/NN pate/NN which/WDT was/VBD much/RB more/JJR cheese/NN than/IN pate/NN ,/, then/RB a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ take/NN on/IN enchiladas/NNS which/WDT unfortunately/RB was/VBD the/DT kind/NN of/IN standard/JJ I/PRP 'd/MD expect/VB in/IN McDonalds/NNP ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN had/VBD duck/NN and/CC orange/NN pate/NN which/WDT was/VBD horrible/JJ ;/: he/PRP only/RB ate/VBP half/DT of/IN it/PRP ./.
He/PRP then/RB had/VBD steak/NN ,/, which/WDT he/PRP said/VBD was/VBD nice/JJ but/CC the/DT crevettes/NNS it/PRP came/VBD with/IN were/VBD mushy/JJ and/CC very/RB over-cooked/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT mashed/JJ potato/NN with/IN was/VBD dry/JJ and/CC crumbly/RB -/JJ he/PRP said/VBD it/PRP reminded/VBD him/PRP of/IN the/DT sort/NN of/IN potato/NN you/PRP 'd/MD get/VB at/IN school/NN ./.
He/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP 'd/RB had/VBD all/DT been/VBN left/VBN under/IN a/DT heat/NN lamp/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VBD so/RB dry/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD discussing/VBG how/WRB it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN so/RB busy/JJ and/CC the/DT only/RB conclusion/NN that/IN we/PRP came/VBD to/TO was/VBD that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN a/DT tourist/NN trap/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB this/DT place/NN gets/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN repeat/NN business/NN ./.
My/NNP advice/NN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN somewhere/RB nice/JJ for/IN dinner/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN is/VBZ to/TO go/VB to/TO Maison/NNP Bleue/NNP on/IN Victoria/NNP St/NNP ,/, or/CC The/DT Outsider/NNP on/IN George/NNP IV/NNP Bridge/NNP ./.
