In/IN short/JJ nothing/NN went/VBD well/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD bland/JJ ,/, poorly/RB prepared/VBN and/CC presented/JJ ./.
If/IN I/PRP could/MD ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN this/DT no/NN star/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN few/JJ weeks/NNS since/IN I/PRP had/VBD my/VBN first/JJ (/NN and/CC hopefully/RB the/DT last/JJ )/NN visit/NN to/TO Hibachi/NNP ./.
Two/NN of/IN my/PRP$ girlfriends/NNS and/CC I/PRP came/VBD in/IN right/NN on/IN time/NN for/IN our/PRP$ reservation/NN ./.
The/DT hostess/NN approached/VBD us/PRP then/RB said/VBD our/PRP$ table/NN was/VBD not/RB ready/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD understandable/JJ at/IN first/JJ since/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT busy/NN friday/NN night/NN ./.
She/PRP had/VBD us/PRP seated/VBN at/IN the/DT bar/NN and/CC we/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT cocktail/NN each/DT just/RB to/TO kill/NN some/DT time/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD great/JJ until/IN then/RB ./.
The/DT cocktails/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD all/DT in/IN a/DT good/JJ mood/NN ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB it/PRP 'd/MD take/VB more/RBR than/IN 40/CD mins/NNS for/IN them/PRP to/TO actually/RB ``/`` get/VB our/PRP$ table/JJ ready/NN ''/'' ./.
We/PRP finished/VBD our/PRP$ drinks/NNS after/IN 20/CD mins/NNS and/CC very/RB kindly/RB asked/VBD the/DT hostess/NN when/WRB our/JJ table/NN will/MD be/VB ready/NN ./.

After/IN some/DT time/NN ,/, FINALLY/NNP the/DT other/JJ hostess/NN (/NNS different/JJ one/CD from/IN the/DT one/CD who/WP sat/JJ us/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN )/VBD told/RB us/IN the/DT table/JJ is/VBZ ready/NN and/CC we/PRP HAVE/NNP TO/NNP settle/NNP our/NNP bills/NNS before/IN we/PRP leave/VBP the/DT bar/NN ./.

We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN at/IN the/DT table/JJ and/CC not/RB after/IN so/RB long/RB ,/, the/DT server/NN approached/VBD us/PRP ./.
We/PRP already/RB knew/VBD what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBP and/CC ordered/NN ./.
He/PRP said/VBD we/PRP have/VBP to/TO wait/NN for/IN the/DT table/JJ to/TO be/VB filled/VBN ./.

Skipping/VBG to/TO the/DT conclusion/NN ,/, the/DT whole/JJ process/NN of/IN waiting/NN for/IN the/DT other/JJ customers/NNS to/TO arrive/VB ,/, to/TO order/VB food/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO actually/RB have/VB the/DT chef/NN show/VBD up/RP to/TO the/DT table/JJ took/NN ANOTHER/NNP 35/NNP mins/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD starving/VBG ./.
The/DT show/NN began/VBD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB mediocre/RB ./.
Same/NNP old/VBD onion/NN volcanoes/NNS and/CC some/DT other/JJ basic/JJ tricks/NNS that/IN you/PRP see/VBP at/IN other/JJ teppanyaki/NN restaurants/NNS ./.
For/IN food/NN ,/, we/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT green/JJ dragon/NN roll/NN to/TO share/NN as/IN an/DT appetizer/NN ,/, then/RB fillet/JJ mignon/NN for/IN myself/NN and/CC two/CD other/JJ things/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ teppanyaki/NN main/NN menu/NN for/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS ./.
The/DT green/JJ dragon/NN roll/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB remember/VBP just/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT poorly/RB cut/VBN avocados/NNS on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT roll/NN ./.
Wanted/NNP my/VBD fillet/NN mignon/NN to/TO be/VB cooked/VBN rare/JJ and/CC turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB cooked/VBN medium/NN ./.
My/NNP friends/NNS and/CC I/PRP were/VBD actually/RB too/RB tired/VBD out/IN to/TO make/VB complaints/NNS by/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP were/VBD served/VBN ./.
The/DT food/NN ,/, to/TO be/VB honest/NN ,/, was/VBD not/RB the/DT worst/NN but/CC not/RB the/DT best/JJS either/NN ./.
In/IN total/JJ ,/, it/PRP took/VBD hibachi/NN 75MINS/CD to/TO put/CD just/RB any/DT food/NN into/IN our/PRP$ mouths/NNS ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP how/WRB the/DT teppanyaki/NN restaurants/NNS work../NN but/CC this/DT was/VBD just/RB overwhelming/VBG ./.
And/CC yet/RB ,/, the/DT best/JJS part/NN has/VBZ n't/RB come/VBN out/RP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD just/RB about/IN half/DT way/NN done/IN eating/VBG when/WRB we/PRP heard/VBP something/NN unexpected/JJ ./.
Apparently/RB ,/, who/WP seemed/-NONE- to/TO be/VB like/IN the/DT manager/NN or/CC the/DT supervisor/NN was/VBD YELLING/NNP at/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ staffs/NNS in/IN front/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT customers/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB REALLY/JJ uncomfortable/JJ to/TO witness/NN the/DT whole/JJ yelling/NN ,/, shouting/NN ,/, and/CC swearing/VBG while/IN eating/VBG ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, swearing/VBG ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB finish/VB our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
We/PRP just/RB asked/VBD for/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, paid/NNP ,/, then/RB came/VBD out/IN ./.
The/DT staffs/NNS were/VBD nice/RB and/CC friendly/RB ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ actually/RB the/DT only/JJ nice/JJ thing/NN I/PRP could/MD say/VB about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
If/IN anyone/NN wants/VBZ to/TO try/NNP teppanyaki/NNP ,/, just/RB go/VBP somewhere/RB else/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB not/RB worth/VB it/PRP to/TO spend/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN time/NN and/CC the/DT money/NN for/IN such/JJ place/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD been/VBN eyeing/VBG the/DT new/JJ Hibachi/NNP Grill/NNP which/WDT opened/VBD up/RB this/DT fall/NN at/IN the/DT Thompson/NNP Toronto/NNP ,/, as/IN we/PRP literally/RB live/VBP a/DT block/NN away/RB ./.
So/RB on/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN 's/POS birthday/NN I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO make/VB reservations/NNS ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RP going/VBG with/IN the/DT prix/NN fixe/NN menu/NN ,/, with/IN some/DT upgrades/NNS ./.
This/DT includes/NN soup/RB ,/, salad/RB ,/, fried/VBN rice/NN ,/, sushi/NN rolls/NNS ,/, ice/RB cream/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT grilled/JJ meats/NNS and/CC veggies/NNS ./.
The/DT fare/NN was/VBD pretty/RB standard/JJ for/IN a/DT hibachi/JJ grill/NN ,/, steak/NN ,/, chicken/NN ,/, scallops/NNS and/CC shrimp/NN ./.
They/PRP did/VBD add/VB lobster/NN to/TO the/DT mix/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD nice/JJ touch/NN ./.
The/DT scoops/NNS of/IN ice/JJ cream/NN were/VBD nice-sized/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ good/JJ cause/NN my/NN hubs/VBZ loves/NNS ice/RB cream/NN ./.
The/DT most/JJS entertaining/JJ part/NN of/IN course/NN were/VBD the/DT antics/NNS of/IN the/DT chef/NN juggling/VBG his/PRP$ tools/NNS and/CC setting/VBG food/NN on/IN fire/NN ./.
(/RB See/VBP the/DT two/CD videos/NNS I/PRP posted/VBD ./. )/''
I/PRP had/VBD previously/RB asked/VBN to/TO add/VB on/IN a/DT birthday/NN package/NN ,/, but/CC as/IN the/DT evening/NN drew/VBD to/TO a/DT close/JJ I/PRP saw/VBD no/DT sign/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
Even/RB my/VBD mother-in-law/NN commented/VBD that/IN a/DT candle/NN and/CC cake/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN nice/JJ ./.
A/DT couple/NN of/IN gentle/JJ reminders/NNS later/JJ ,/, the/DT wait/NN staff/NN did/VBD serenade/NN my/NN husband/NN with/IN drums/NNS ,/, a/DT chef/NN hat/NN and/CC really/RB nice/JJ green/JJ tea/NN cheesecake/NN (/NN yes/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT candle/NN )/NN They/PRP even/RB gave/VBD us/PRP a/DT framed/VBN photo/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ memento/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ down/NN side/NN was/VBD that/IN although/IN mostly/RB courteous/JJ ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN a/DT language/NN barrier/NN with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT wait/NN staff/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ unexpected/JJ given/IN the/DT venue/NN ./.
None-the-less/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT really/RB fun/JJ evening/NN ./.
My/NNP Rating/NNP :/: 3.5/10/CD ./.
1.5/CD points/NNS deducted/VBD because/IN food/NN although/IN good/JJ ,/, was/VBD pretty/RB standard/JJ ,/, no/DT delectable/JJ surprises/NNS ./.
1/CD point/NN deducted/VBD for/IN wait/NN staff/NN forgetting/VBG the/DT birthday/NN package/NN and/CC potentially/RB embarrassing/VBG me/PRP in/IN front/NN of/IN my/NN in/IN laws/NNS ./.
Pro/NNP Tip/NNP :/: When/WRB you/PRP make/VBP the/DT reservations/NNS ,/, ask/VBP to/TO purchase/NN coupons/NNS at/IN the/DT door/NN ./.
You/PRP get/VBP a/DT 2/NN for/IN 1/CD deal/NN on/IN the/DT prix/NN fixe/NN menu/NN ,/, which/WDT works/NNS really/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT wallet/NN ./.
Nice/NNP ambience/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT teppanyaki/NN lover/NN so/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB particularly/RB appreciate/VB the/DT effort/NN at/IN show-cooking/JJ but/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ some/DT people/NNS would/MD ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ (/NN I/PRP had/VBD a/DT mix/NN of/IN scallops/NNS ,/, prawns/NNS and/CC lobster/NN )/NN ,/, I/PRP actually/RB enjoyed/VBD the/DT small/JJ starter/NN of/IN sashimi/NN so/RB also/RB the/DT raw/NN fish/JJ bar/NN could/MD be/VB worth/VBN it/PRP ./.
Price/NN was/VBD okay/NN ./.
Delicious/JJ meal/NN !/.
I/PRP dined/VBD here/RB with/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN this/DT past/NN Saturday/NNP !/.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT salmon/JJ combo/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT chicken/NN &/CC scallops/NNS ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD so/RB fresh/JJ and/CC tasty/NN ./.

!/NN
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN what/WP really/RB got/VBD my/PRP$ attention/NN was/VBD the/DT service/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD exceptionally/RB friendly/RB ,/, and/CC good/JJ with/IN customers/NNS overall/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD just/RB wished/VBN the/DT chef/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR enthusiastic/JJ ./.
There/EX may/MD have/VB only/RB been/VBN 4/JJ people/NNS at/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT show/NN just/RB seemed/VBD a/DT little/JJ lacklustre/NN ./.
The/DT egg/NN toss/NN and/CC fire/NN volcano/NN were/VBD nice/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT performance/NN just/RB felt/VBD very/RB ``/`` let/NNP 's/POS get/NN this/DT over/NN with/IN ''/'' ./.
Aside/NN from/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB the/DT food/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT letdown/NN ./.
We/PRP used/VBD a/DT Groupon/NN that/WDT listed/VBN a/DT $/$ 140/CD face/NN value/NN for/IN 2/JJ people/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT HUGE/NNP inflation.The/NN food/NN was/VBD just/RB average/JJ ./.
Sad/NNP to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN better/JJ miso/NN soup/NN and/CC Japanese/JJ salad/NN at/IN AYCE/NNP restaurants/NNS ./.
The/DT chef/NN 's/POS choice/NN roll/NN was/VBD pretty/RB decent/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ if/IN it/PRP was/VBD chicken/VBN or/CC shrimp/VB tempura/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT roll/NN tasted/VBD okay/NN ./.
The/DT teppanyaki/NN I/PRP must/MD say/VB provided/IN a/DT substantial/JJ amount/NN of/IN food/NN with/IN LOTS/NNP of/IN variety/NN ./.
Lobster/NNP ,/, shrimp/NN ,/, scallops/NNS ,/, chicken/NN and/CC steak/NN cooked/VBD the/DT way/NN you/PRP want/VBP it/PRP ./.
They/PRP give/VBP you/PRP dark/VBP and/CC light/JJ sauces/NNS to/TO dip/VB in/IN ./.
The/DT dark/NN tastes/VBZ like/IN typical/JJ steak/JJ sauce/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT light/JJ tastes/NNS like/IN a/DT thousand/NN island/NN mayonnaise/NN variation/NN ./.
Without/IN the/DT sauce/JJ the/DT food/NN is/VBZ rather/RB bland/NN ./.
While/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ charred/NN flavour/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, a/DT little/JJ salt/NN or/CC seasoning/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN nice/JJ ./.
The/DT green/JJ tea/NN ice/NN cream/NN was/VBD much/RB creamier/JJR than/IN I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/NN ,/, if/IN I/PRP closed/VBP my/JJ eyes/NNS ,/, I/PRP probably/RB would/MD have/VB thought/VBN it/PRP was/VBD vanilla/NN ./.
Overall/IN a/DT 3.5/CD star/NN experience/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD okay/JJ ,/, show/NN was/VBD okay/JJ ,/, service/NN was/VBD exceptional/JJ !/.
After/IN tax/NN and/CC tip/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB too/RB far/RB from/IN the/DT face/NN value/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD an/DT interesting/JJ visit/NN to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN for/IN my/PRP$ 30th/CD birthday/NN ./.

The/DT service/NN we/PRP received/VBD was/VBD poor/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD n't/RB say/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB busy/JJ in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN -/JJ perhaps/NN 5/IN other/JJ tables/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT waiter/NN was/VBD forgetting/VBG many/JJ items/NNS and/CC the/DT worst/JJ thing/NN was/VBD that/IN they/PRP gave/VBD my/PRP$ birthday/NN cake/NN that/WDT my/-NONE- friend/VBP had/VBD brought/VBN it/PRP for/IN me/PRP to/TO another/DT table/JJ ./.
They/PRP had/VBD also/RB lost/VBN my/NNP friend/NN 's/POS umbrella/NN which/WDT they/PRP had/VBD said/VBN they/PRP would/MD keep/VB at/IN the/DT front/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD wet/JJ from/IN the/DT rain/NN ./.

The/DT manager/NN -/JJ Joey/NNP was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC checked/VBD up/RP on/IN us/PRP to/TO make/VB sure/JJ our/NN experience/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Fillet/NNP mignon/NN ,/, lobster/NNP &/CC scallops/NNP which/NNP was/VBD all/DT cooked/VBN perfectly/RB !/.

This/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ for/IN lunch/NN during/IN the/DT week/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB quiet/JJ but/CC they/PRP still/RB do/VBP the/DT full/JJ on/IN tepanyaki/NN show/NN ./.
The/DT meal/NN ended/VBD up/RP being/VBG pretty/RB affordable/JJ for/IN what/WP it/PRP was/VBD ./.
The/DT lunch/NN special/NN was/VBD a/DT great/JJ deal/NN ./.
The/DT sake/NN was/VBD good/JJ too/NN ./.
They/PRP mostly/VBP do/VBP warm/NN sake/NN they/PRP said/VBD but/CC can/MD make/VB any/DT of/IN the/DT sakes/NNS cold/NN ./.
The/DT one/CD we/NN had/VBD was/VBN interesting/JJ because/IN it/PRP was/VBD unfiltered/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD friendly/RB ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, this/DT spot/NN is/VBZ great/JJ value/NN for/IN a/DT show/NN and/CC a/DT meal/NN ,/, especially/RB during/IN lunch/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ that/IN such/JJ a/DT place/NN is/VBZ open/JJ for/IN lunch/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB tried/VBN it/PRP for/IN dinner/NN but/CC I/PRP definitely/RB recommend/VBP it/PRP for/IN lunch/NN !/.
Had/NNP a/DT great/JJ experience/NN here/RB at/IN Hibachi/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, the/DT price/NN is/VBZ okay/JJ but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB worth/JJ it/PRP if/IN you/PRP go/VBP every/DT so/RB often/RB for/IN that/DT experience/NN ./.
The/DT chefs/NNS put/VBD on/IN a/DT little/JJ cooking/NN show/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ to/TO watch/NN ,/, I/PRP brought/VBD my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN here/RB for/IN his/PRP$ birthday/NN and/CC they/PRP had/VBD the/DT cutest/funniest/JJS birthday/NN package/NN (/NNS could/MD n't/RB stop/VB laughing/JJ )/NNS ./.
Overall/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT really/RB nice/JJ experience/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ time/NN with/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN eating/VBG here/RB at/IN the/DT hibachi/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
The/DT experience/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Our/NNP chef/NN 's/POS name/NN was/VBD Justin/NNP ./.
I/PRP really/VBP enjoyed/VBN the/DT part/NN where/WRB he/PRP lit/VBD the/DT onion/NN on/IN fire/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB tried/VBD to/TO threw/VB little/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN broccoli/NN into/IN our/PRP$ mouths/NNS with/IN his/PRP$ spatula/NN ./.
He/PRP succeeded/VBD the/DT first/JJ two/CD times/NNS and/CC then/RB it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB go/VB so/RB well/RB for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN us/PRP but/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ laugh/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD actually/RB really/RB bland/JJ ./.
The/DT teriyaki/NN sauce/NN they/PRP used/VBD is/VBZ extremely/RB light/JJ and/CC the/DT dipping/JJ sauces/NNS they/PRP provided/RB ,/, which/WDT were/VBD a/DT mayo-based/JJ and/CC a/DT ginger/soy/JJ sauce/NN based/NN ,/, were/VBD also/RB a/DT bit/JJ plain/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT person/NN that/WDT usually/RB eat/JJ salty/NN stuff/NN ./.
Portion/NN is/VBZ plenty/JJ though/IN ./.
Also/RB ,/, expect/VBP the/DT steak/NN to/TO be/VB over/IN cooked/JJ because/IN they/PRP were/VBD chopped/VBN into/IN small/JJ pieces/NNS ./.
The/DT Groupon/NNP was/VBD $/$ 75/CD for/IN two/CD plus/NNS tax/NN and/CC 15/CD %/NN service/NN charge/NN already/RB added/VBD which/WDT ended/VBD up/RP being/VBG $/$ 97.46/CD ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ deal/NN because/IN I/PRP think/VBP the/DT deluxe/NN combo/NN which/WDT is/VBZ $/$ 42/CD per/CD person/NN is/VBZ somewhat/JJ similar/JJ but/CC comes/VBZ with/IN filet/NN mignon/NN and/CC salmon/NN if/IN I/PRP remember/VBP correctly/RB ./.
Groupon/NNP claims/VBD that/IN this/DT deal/NN is/VBZ originally/RB $/$ 150/CD in/IN value/NN is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ an/DT exaggerated/VBN overstatement/NN ./.
Overall/NNP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ experience/NN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/VBG a/DT second/JJ visit/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ maybe/JJ really/RB a/DT 3.5/CD star/NN ./.
Our/IN group/NN of/IN eight/NN were/VBD here/RB on/IN my/PRP$ birthday/NN ./.
Excellent/NNP service/NN provided/NN by/IN our/PRP$ host/NN Shogu/NNP (/NNP spelt/NN incorrectly/RB )/JJ ,/, very/RB friendly/RB and/CC accommodative/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ requests/NNS for/IN shifting/VBG us/PRP to/TO a/DT smaller/JJR table/JJ and/CC making/JJ changes/NNS to/TO the/DT price/NN fixed/NN menu/NN due/JJ to/TO dietary/JJ requirements/NNS ./.
Ambiance/NNP was/VBD smart/JJ casual/JJ ,/, and/CC very/RB modern/JJ ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC plentiful/JJ ,/, cooked/JJ with/IN some/DT fanfare/NN by/IN the/DT chef/NN ./.
Scallops/NNP ,/, shrimp/NN ,/, steak/NN and/CC chicken/NN were/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/NN as/IN requested/VBN by/IN each/DT couple/NN ,/, sauces/VBZ provided/NN for/IN those/DT who/WP needed/VBN more/JJR flavor/NN with/IN their/PRP$ meat/NN or/CC seafood/NN dishes/NNS ./.
A/DT really/NN nice/NN place/NN to/TO come/VB with/IN a/DT group/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT Teppanyaki/NNP style/NN of/IN cooking/VBG right/NN at/IN the/DT table/JJ ,/, although/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO speak/VB loudly/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB heard/NN at/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT table/JJ ./.
When/WRB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS mentioned/VBD to/TO the/DT host/NN Shogu/NNP it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN birthday/NN ,/, we/PRP got/VBD a/DT cheesecake/NN slice/NN with/IN a/DT candle/NN on/IN it/PRP ,/, a/DT group/NN picture/NN was/VBD taken/VBN ,/, printed/JJ and/CC put/VBD on/IN a/DT card/NN for/IN the/DT group/NN to/TO sign/VB .../: a/DT very/RB nice/JJ touch/NN ./.
An/DT extra/JJ star/NN just/RB for/IN this/DT neat/NN little/RB surprise/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB Hibachi/NNP at/IN the/DT Thompson/NNP and/CC would/MD definitely/RB come/VB back/RB again/RB ./.
Came/NN here/RB with/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN on/IN a/DT late/JJ Friday/NNP night/NN as/IN we/PRP had/VBD purchased/VBN a/DT groupon/NN (/VBD $/$ 75/CD for/IN a/DT 7/NN course/NN meal/NN for/IN 2/CD )/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, servers/NNS were/VBD overly/RB friendly/RB and/CC accommating/VBG ./.
We/PRP first/VBP got/VBN our/PRP$ miso/NN soup/RB (/JJ delicious/JJ !/.
Not/RB too/RB salty/JJ and/CC perfectly/RB hot/NN )/NN then/RB our/VBD house/NN ginger/NN salad/JJ (/NN delicious/JJ as/IN well/RB )/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB got/VBD a/DT vegetable/JJ sushi/NN roll/NN which/WDT was/VBD so/RB yummy/JJ ,/, definitely/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS rolls/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN and/CC I/PRP wanted/VBD more/RBR ./.
Next/NNP ,/, the/DT teppanyaki/NN chef/NN came/VBD and/CC prepared/VBN our/PRP$ entrees/NNS !/.
It/PRP was/VBD quite/RB a/DT fun/JJ show/NN to/TO watch/VB especially/RB the/DT onion/NN trick/NN ./.
He/PRP grilled/VBD some/DT vegetables/NNS and/CC vegetarian/JJ fried/VBN rice/NN as/IN our/PRP$ next/JJ meal/NN ./.
The/DT vegetarian/JJ rice/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ,/, a/DT bit/NN too/RB buttery/JJ tasting/VBG imo/NN ./.
The/DT vegetables/NNS were/VBD yummy/JJ !/.
For/IN our/PRP$ main/JJ meal/NN we/PRP had/VBD strip/VBN loin/JJ steak/NN ,/, lobster/NN tail/NN ,/, chicken/VBN filet/NN ,/, shrimp/NN ,/, and/CC Atlantic/JJ scallops/NNS ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, the/DT groupon/NN comes/VBZ with/IN all/DT of/IN these/DT meats/NNS but/CC not/RB a/DT full/JJ portion/NN of/IN each/DT meat/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB filling/VBG !/.
I/PRP thought/VBD our/PRP$ steak/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN perfectly/RB medium/NN rare/NN and/CC the/DT shrimp/NN was/VBD wonderfully/RB juicy/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD have/VB cared/VBN less/JJR for/IN the/DT chicken/NN and/CC scallops/NNS though/IN ./.
Then/RB finally/RB ,/, to/TO finish/VB it/PRP off/IN we/PRP got/VBD a/DT scoop/NN of/IN ice/JJ cream/NN !/.
Overall/NNP ,/, my/NNP bf/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ time/NN and/CC really/RB enjoyed/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN and/CC the/DT entertainment/NN ./.
Would/NNP come/VBD here/RB again/RB but/CC only/RB on/IN special/JJ occasions/NNS as/IN it/PRP it/PRP on/IN the/DT pricier/NN side/NN (/NN paid/VBD over/IN $/$ 100/CD for/IN the/DT groupon/NN with/IN tax/tip/NN and/CC a/DT couple/NN beers/VBZ )/NN :/: )/.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC engaging/VBG ,/, but/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT food/NN ,/, well/RB mind/IN I/PRP say/VBP the/DT most/RBS overpriced/JJ and/CC overrated/VBN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB encountered/VBN in/IN Toronto/NNP ?/.
It/PRP feels/VBZ like/IN you/PRP 've/VBP walked/VBN into/IN the/DT 1990s/CD where/WRB people/NNS crowd/VBP around/IN teppanyaki/NN as/IN a/DT form/NN of/IN exotic/JJ oriental/JJ performance/NN ,/, that/IN said/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN is/VBZ inevitably/RB secondary/JJ to/TO the/DT performance/NN they/PRP 've/VBP put/VBN on/IN ./.
I/PRP truly/VBP do/RB believe/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN work/NN ,/, effort/NN ,/, and/CC skill/NN each/NN and/CC every/DT chef/NN invests/NNS in/IN ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT restaurant/JJ itself/NN ,/, I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB bring/VB myself/NN to/TO say/VB I/PRP would/MD ever/RB come/VB here/RB again/RB or/CC pretend/NN to/TO like/IN the/DT lacklustre-uneventful/JJ taste/NN of/IN such/JJ a/DT theatrical/JJ meal/NN ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP paying/VBG $/$ 30+/CD for/IN a/DT performance/NN ,/, a/DT seat/NN at/IN a/DT orientalist/JJ facade/NN ./.
With/IN all/DT that/DT being/NNP said/VBD ,/, service/NN was/VBD friendly/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN comes/NN before/IN all/DT decor/NN or/CC presentation/NN
We/PRP took/VBD my/PRP$ niece/NN here/RB for/IN her/PRP 16th/CD birthday/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ cook/NN was/VBD more/JJR on/IN the/DT quiet/JJ side/NN .../: ./. did/VBD the/DT standard/JJ show/NN with/IN the/DT onion/NN fire/NN volcano/NN ,/, but/CC no/DT talking/NN beyond/IN ``/`` how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP like/VB your/PRP$ steak/NN cooked/VBD ?/. ''/''
hence/NN only/RB 4/JJ stars/NNS ./.
Over/IN all/PDT the/DT food/NN tasted/VBD great/JJ and/CC we/PRP had/VBD fun/VBN watching/NN our/PRP$ food/NN get/NN cooked/VBD ./.
