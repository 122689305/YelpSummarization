Great/NNP place/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB South/NNP Indian/NNP food/NN Thali/NNP was/VBD good/JJ along/NN with/IN mini/NN tiffin/NN Pretty/NNP busy/NN on/IN weekends/NNS Do/NNP n't/RB forget/JJ to/TO try/VB the/DT coffee/NN (/VBD served/VBN in/IN traditional/JJ stainless/NN steel/NN utensils/NNS )/VBP Washroom/NNP pretty/NNP clean/JJ
We/PRP went/VBD during/IN Thanksgiving/NNP weekend/NN and/CC realized/VBD they/PRP only/RB had/VBD a/DT buffet/NN for/IN $/$ 14-15/person/CD ./.
The/DT dosas/NNS were/VBD brought/RB fresh/JJ to/TO your/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
Dosas/NNP were/VBD made/VBN from/IN chickpea/NN and/CC rice/NN flour/JJ (/NN i.e/NN ./.

But/CC all/DT restaurants/NNS here/RB use/VBP this/DT method/NN rather/RB than/IN actually/RB soaking/VBG ``/`` washed/JJ urad/NN dhal/NN ''/'' and/CC rice/NN and/CC then/RB grinding/VBG them/PRP and/CC allowing/VBG it/PRP to/TO ferment/NN (/NNS have/VBP a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT sour/JJ flavour/NN which/WDT I/PRP love/VBP )/RB ./.
Sambar/NNP was/VBD warm/NN but/CC the/DT idlis/NN and/CC vardas/NNS and/CC other/JJ dishes/NNS were/VBD cold/NN ./.
Sambar/NNP tasted/VBD okay/NN ./.
Three/NNP types/NNS of/IN chutneys/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN lemon/NN pickle/NN ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT hoppers/NNS dish/VBP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN could/MD be/VB better/RBR ./.
We/PRP went/VBD there/RB 1/2/CD hour/NN before/IN closing/JJ and/CC were/VBD rushed/VBN to/TO order/NN and/CC our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD n't/RB even/RB hot/VB ./.

I/PRP used/VBD to/TO love/VB their/PRP$ ala/NN carte/NN menu/NN .../: now/RB they/PRP have/VBP all/DT day/NN buffet/NN very/RB bad/JJ and/CC stale/JJ food/NN .../: ..avoid/JJ at/IN any/DT cost/NN .../: .we/NN ca/MD n't/RB even/RB order/VB ala/NN carte/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP really/RB not/RB sure/JJ why/RB this/DT place/NN gets/NNS such/JJ bad/JJ reviews/NNS -/JJ maybe/NN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN has/VBZ gone/VBN down/RP over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, or/CC maybe/JJ people/NNS are/VBP comparing/VBG it/PRP to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT more/RBR fancy/expensive/JJ dosa/NN places/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT Chana/NNP Bhatura/NNP &/CC the/DT Dosa/NNP that/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP were/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT complete/JJ sucker/NN for/IN Sambar/NNP ./.
For/IN the/DT price/NN and/CC the/DT quick/JJ service/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ alternative/NN to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ choices/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO the/DT Scarborough/NNP location/NN and/CC had/VBD a/DT decent/JJ experience/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN is/VBZ much/JJ better/NN now/RB and/CC we/PRP visit/VBP this/DT place/NN a/DT couple/NN of/IN times/NNS a/DT month/NN and/CC are/VBP pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN with/IN the/DT changes/NNS ./.
2014/CD Review/NN :/: I/PRP 'm/VBP really/RB disappointed/VBN with/IN the/DT degrading/VBG quality/NN of/IN food/NN and/CC service/NN at/IN this/DT place/NN ./.

The/DT place/NN has/VBZ been/VBN upgraded/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ about/IN the/DT only/RB good/JJ thing/NN with/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT new/JJ management/NN is/VBZ pathetic/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN equally/RB worse/JJ ./.
We/PRP went/VBD in/IN on/IN a/DT Monday/NNP night/NN for/IN dinner/NN and/CC the/DT waitress/NN took/VBD our/NN order/NN and/CC took/VBD close/NN to/TO half/DT and/CC hour/VBD to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ appetizer/NN ./.
The/DT vada/NN was/VBD spoilt/JJ and/CC when/WRB we/PRP mentioned/VBD it/PRP to/TO her/PRP ,/, she/PRP just/RB ran/VBD away/RB and/CC came/VBD back/RP after/IN a/DT while/NN to/TO say/VB that/IN ``/`` This/DT is/VBZ how/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ ''/'' !/NN !/IN !/.

She/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT lengthy/JJ discussion/NN in/IN the/DT Kitchen/NNP and/CC another/DT waitress/NN came/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC served/VBD our/JJ food/NN almost/RB 40/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ ./.
She/PRP did/VBD however/RB apologize/VB for/IN the/DT delay/NN ./.
Much/NNP better/JJR than/IN our/PRP$ previous/JJ waitress/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD appalled/VBN at/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN service/NN here/RB and/CC vowed/VBD never/RB to/TO come/VB back/RB here/RB again/RB and/CC recommend/VB people/NNS from/IN going/VBG here/RB ever/RB ./.

Their/NNP excuse/NN for/IN cold/NN sambar/NN was/VBD that/IN they/PRP 're/VBP just/RB preparing/VBG it/PRP because/IN of/IN the/DT rush/JJ ./.
Should/NNP n't/RB that/IN mean/VB the/DT sambar/NN should/MD be/VB hot/NN ?/NNS !/VBP ?/.
And/CC their/PRP$ servings/NNS for/IN sambar/JJ are/VBP too/RB small/JJ ./.
They/PRP skimp/VBP on/IN the/DT chutneys/NNS ./.
We/PRP 'd/VBP ordered/VBN a/DT Kara/NNP dosa/NN which/WDT they/PRP got/VBD wrong/JJ ./.
Not/RB authentic/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.

And/CC when/WRB we/PRP asked/VBP for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB brought/VBN back/RP and/CC served/VBD hot/NN we/PRP got/VBD a/DT lame/NN excuse/NN that/IN the/DT milk/NN was/VBD just/RB poured/VBN fresh/JJ ,/, what/WP fresh/NN from/IN the/DT fridge/NN ?/VBD !/NN ?/.
When/WRB they/PRP did/VBD take/VB the/DT coffee/NN back/RB ,/, it/PRP never/RB was/VBD served/VBN again/RB ./.

They/PRP finally/RB brought/VBD out/RP a/DT jug/NN of/IN water/NN as/IN we/PRP were/VBD putting/VBG on/IN our/PRP$ jackets/NNS to/TO leave/NNS ./.

My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD another/DT dosa/NN which/WDT was/VBD so/RB greasy/JJ that/IN it/PRP had/VBD no/DT taste/NN but/CC stale/NN oil/NN ./.
The/DT thali/NN looked/VBD OK/NNP but/CC tasted/VBN zilch/NN ./.
The/DT little/JJ bowls/NNS that/IN the/DT sambar/NN came/VBD in/IN .../NN that/IN was/VBD a/DT mystery/NN .../: some/DT of/IN them/PRP were/VBD stuck/JJ inside/JJ the/DT other-/NN probably/RB the/DT dishwasher/NN could/MD not/RB get/VB them/PRP separated-/JJ so/RB basically/RB that/IN meant/NN that/IN the/DT lower/JJR one/NN was/VBD dirty/JJ ./.

I/PRP 'd/VBP like/IN to/TO select/VB my/JJ kind/NN of/IN crisp/NN dosa/NN next/JJ time/NN ./.
Dosa/NNP is/VBZ sometimes/RB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT delicacy/NN ./.
Most/NNS do/VBP not/RB make/VB this/DT at/NN home/NN ./.
So/RB when/WRB looking/NNS for/IN a/DT dosa/NN fix/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT proper/NN one/CD ,/, I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN to/TO come/VB here/RB ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB about/IN 3/CD times/NNS this/DT year/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ minimal/JJ ./.
You/PRP get/VBP your/JJ food/NN ,/, which/WDT comes/-NONE- in/IN small/JJ portions/NNS ,/, and/CC you/PRP get/VB out/IN ./.
You/PRP pay/VBP at/IN the/DT counter/NN at/IN the/DT front/NN ./.
So/IN that/DT kind/NN of/IN tells/NNS you/PRP what/WP type/NN of/IN set/NN up/IN this/DT is/NN ./.
Zero/NNP ambiance/NN ./.
hard/JJ cold/NN seats/NNS ,/, storefront/JJ setting/NN ,/, in/IN a/DT plaza/NN ./.
Walls/NNP peeling/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ all/DT veg/JJ food/NN -/NN no/DT meat/NN ./.
The/DT dosa/NN was/VBD barely/RB filled/VBN ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, barely/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD say/VB two/CD tablespoons/NNS of/IN filling/NN in/IN the/DT large/JJ paper/NN dosa/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD rather/RB go/VB to/TO Annjapar/VB a/DT bit/NN further/JJ south/NN ./.
This/DT Saravanaa/NNP is/VBZ not/RB as/RB well/RB run/JJ as/IN the/DT one/CD in/IN Scarborough/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/DT good/JJ ./.
The/DT dosa/NN was/VBD cold/JJ &/CC okay/NN ./.
The/DT sambar/JJ tasted/VBN like/IN spicy/NN north/NN Indian/NNP dal/NNP !/.
I/PRP am/VBP surprised/VBN since/IN I/PRP was/VBD under/IN the/DT impression/NN that/IN this/DT Saravanaa/NNP in/IN Mississauga/NNP will/MD be/VB better/RBR than/IN the/DT one/CD in/IN Scarborough/NNP ./.
Three/NNP stars/NNS for/IN the/DT absolutely/RB amazing/JJ delicious/JJ food/NN ./.
They/PRP lose/VBP two/CD stars/NNS from/IN me/RB because/IN their/PRP$ service/NN is/VBZ HORRIBLE/NNP ./.
Not/RB only/RB are/VBP they/PRP EXTREMELY/NNP slow/NNP ,/, they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB actually/RB care/VB about/IN it/PRP ./.
They/PRP forgot/VBP half/DT of/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN about/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS after/IN the/DT first/JJ part/NN was/VBD brought/VBN to/TO the/DT table/JJ they/PRP ``/`` remembered/VBN ''/'' one/CD dish/JJ was/VBD completely/RB forgotten/VBN about/IN ,/, had/VBD to/TO ask/VB (/PDT the/DT girl/NN who/WP was/VBD sitting/VBG on/IN her/PRP$ phone/NN in/IN the/DT corner/NN )/VBD to/TO please/VB it/PRP to/TO us/PRP ./.
We/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB get/VB them/PRP to/TO bring/VB the/DT bill/NN after/IN asking/VBG twice/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB waiting/NN or/CC being/VBG ignored/VBN ./.
At/IN least/JJS the/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./.
Ultimate/NNP south/NN indian/JJ breakfast/NN buffet/NN !/.
Totally/RB satisfied/VBD with/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ ,/, Dosas/NNP are/VBP crisp/NN ,/, chutneys/NNS are/VBP delicious/JJ and/CC sambar/JJ is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN !/.

It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN reviewers/NNS have/VBP already/RB shared/VBN their/PRP$ strong/JJ feelings/NNS on/IN the/DT flavor/NN (/NN or/CC the/DT lack/NN thereof/NN )/NN of/IN Saravanaa/NNP Bhavan/NNP ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB terrible/JJ like/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT reviews/NNS would/MD have/VB you/PRP believe/VB ./.
But/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB particularly/RB amazing/JJ either/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP if/IN we/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN from/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN better/RB ,/, but/CC we/PRP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT buffet/NN option/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD all/DT .../: one-note/JJ .../: Not/RB bad/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD food/VBN stuffs/NNS that/WDT helped/-NONE- fill/VBP our/JJ bellies/NNS before/IN we/PRP left/VBP town/VBN ./.

5/JJ stars/NNS if/IN you/PRP eat/VBP at/IN a/DT saravana/NN bhavan/NN in/IN Chennai/NNP ,/, India/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB here/RB ./.
They/PRP are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO create/VB the/DT same/JJ magic/NN here/RB ./.

If/IN you/PRP want/VBP taste/JJ something/NN different/JJ this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
On/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN Chennai/NNP 's/POS Saravana/NNP Bhawan/NNP we/PRP visited/VBD here/RB three/CD to/TO four/CD times/NNS but/CC not/RB good/JJ as/IN other/JJ branches/NNS are/VBP ./.
Last/JJ time/NN visited/VBD Delhi/NNP 's/POS Saravana/NNP Bhawan/NNP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
We/PRP ca/VBP n't/RB even/RB compare/VB this/DT Saravana/NNP to/TO Delhi/NNP 's/POS Saravana/NNP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB liked/VBN there/RB sambar/JJ and/CC dosa/NN was/VBD not/RB crispy/JJ at/IN all/DT even/RB filter/JJ coffee/NN was/VBD like/IN Tim/NNP Hortons/NNP !/.
Also/RB the/DT thali/NN is/VBZ limited/VBN .../JJ Can/NNP you/PRP imagine/VBP ?/RB !/VBN ?/.
For/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP experienced/VBD this/DT kind/NN of/IN thing/NN .../: We/PRP just/RB needed/VBD 1/CD extra/JJ poori/NN and/CC for/IN that/DT only/JJ we/NN had/VBD to/TO pay/NN ./.
We/PRP visited/VBD Bahrain/NNP 's/POS Saravana/NNP also/RB .../:
Even/RB that/IN branch/NN is/VBZ also/RB far/RB better/JJR than/IN this/DT one/CD !/NN
I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO update/JJ my/NN review/NN on/IN this/DT place/NN based/VBN on/IN my/PRP$ experiences/NNS since/IN ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/NNP something/NN different/VBD other/JJ than/IN the/DT usual/JJ thali/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP tried/VBP their/PRP$ Kara/NNP dosa/NN ,/, which/WDT came/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT thick/NN ,/, soggy/JJ dosa/NN with/IN a/DT sweet/JJ tomatoey/NN sauce/NN ./.
Then/RB when/WRB I/PRP visited/VBD again/RB I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB their/PRP$ dosa/NN 's/POS another/DT shot/NN and/CC opted/VBD for/IN their/PRP$ Mysore/NNP masala/NN dosa/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP loved/VBN in/IN other/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
They/PRP warned/VBD me/PRP that/IN this/DT dosa/NN is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB spicy/JJ but/CC I/PRP can/MD handle/VB heat/NN so/IN I/PRP was/VBD fine/VBN with/IN that/DT ./.
But/CC again/RB ,/, I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP getting/VBG a/DT overly/RB thick/JJ dosa/NN that/WDT was/VBD too/RB soggy/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ ./.
My/NNP brother/NN got/VBD the/DT chole/NN bhatura/NN ,/, which/WDT he/PRP enjoyed/VBD but/CC complained/VBD that/IN the/DT bhatura/NN 's/POS were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ too/NN oily/RB ./.
So/IN I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN ordering/VBG something/NN other/JJ than/IN the/DT dosa/NN would/MD be/VB your/VBN best/-NONE- bet/RB because/IN their/PRP$ dosa/NN 's/POS are/VBP just/RB not/RB worth/VB it/PRP and/CC you/PRP can/MD get/VB much/JJ better/NN ones/NNS at/IN Guru/NNP Lukshmi/NNP or/CC Udupi/NNP ./.
Been/NNP here/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN times/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD ok/JJ for/IN most/JJS part/NN ./.

went/IN there/EX for/IN dinner/NN last/JJ night/NN ./.

Food/NNP was/VBD horrible/JJ ./.
Sambar/NNP and/CC Chutney/NNP tasted/VBD bland/NN ./.
Dosa/NNP was/VBD tasteless/JJ ./.
Wo/NNP n't/RB be/VB visiting/VBG them/PRP soon/RB ./.
Saravanaa/NNP has/VBZ gone/VBN on/IN a/DT steep/JJ downhill/NN trajectory/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS in/IN food/NN quality/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ upgrade/NN as/IN of/IN now/RB is/VBZ the/DT restaurant/JJ itself/NN ./.
A/DT few/JJ months/NNS ago/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB unattractive/JJ ,/, almost/RB cafeteria/JJ style/NN ,/, with/IN hard/JJ seats/NNS like/IN you/PRP would/MD find/VB in/IN a/DT food/NN court/NN ./.
Kudos/NNP to/TO them/PRP for/IN getting/NN a/DT massive/JJ facelift/NN ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP took/VBD pictures/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP looks/VBZ lovely/RB inside/NN ./.
They/PRP even/RB have/VBP an/DT electric/JJ fireplace/NN (/NN for/IN some/DT reason/NN )/NNS in/IN the/DT tiny/NN entrance/NN ./.
But/CC ambiance/NN aside/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN itself/NN did/VBD not/RB get/VB a/DT similar/JJ makeover/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD never/RB again/RB order/VB a/DT masala/NN dosa/NN from/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT mere/JJ SMEAR/NN of/IN potato/NN bhaji/NN ,/, a/DT few/JJ tablespoons/NNS at/IN most/JJS ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ dosa/NN ./.
The/DT chutneys/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB bland/JJ and/CC also/RB in/IN small/JJ amounts/NNS ./.
The/DT best/JJS thing/NN was/VBD the/DT sambar/NN ,/, spicy/NN and/CC warming/NN ./.
The/DT dosa/NN itself/NN was/VBD very/RB oily/RB ./.
My/NNP dad/VBD had/VBD the/DT Saravanaa/NNP Special/NNP Meal/NNP ,/, which/WDT consisted/VBN of/IN ten/VBN TINY/NNP dishes/VBZ (/JJ curries/NNS ,/, chutneys/NNS ,/, curd/NN and/CC a/DT gulab/NN jamun/NN )/NN ,/, rice/NN ,/, two/CD papad/NNS and/CC two/CD pooris/NNS ./.
As/IN is/VBZ the/DT apparent/JJ custom/NN here/RB ,/, the/DT poories/NNS were/VBD miniscule/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD baby/JJ poories/NNS ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, how/WRB much/JJ are/VBP they/PRP saving/JJ really/RB by/IN cutting/VBG the/DT quantity/NN of/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN items/NNS ?/.
And/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB like/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ n't/RB hopping/VBG ./.
We/PRP got/VBD there/RB at/IN 7pm/CD for/IN dinner/NN and/CC already/RB a/DT queue/JJ had/NN formed/VBN ./.
This/DT was/VBD the/DT trend/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN ,/, and/CC people/NNS even/RB crowded/VBD outside/NNS and/CC left/NNS when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD told/VBN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT half/NN an/DT hour/NN wait/NN ./.
The/DT waitstaff/NN were/VBD pleasant/JJ enough/JJ ,/, although/IN our/PRP$ server/NN tried/VBD to/TO take/VB away/RP my/PRP$ plate/NN before/IN I/PRP had/VBD finished/VBN ./.
They/PRP also/RB left/VBD the/DT front/NN door/NN open/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, telling/VBG us/PRP ``/`` the/DT air/NN conditioning/NN was/VBD not/RB working/JJ ''/'' ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO note/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD 10/CD degrees/NNS tonight/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT balmy/NN summer/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ NOT/NNP good/JJ for/IN groups/NNS ./.
There/EX are/VBP tables/NNS of/IN 4/CD ,/, and/CC they/PRP can/MD put/VB a/DT few/JJ together/NN if/IN needed/NNS ./.
But/CC do/VBP not/RB come/VB in/RP with/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN 15/CD ,/, like/IN people/NNS did/VBD tonight/NN ,/, and/CC assume/NN you/PRP will/MD get/VB a/DT table/JJ quickly/NN ./.
Check/NNP ahead/RB of/IN time/NN if/IN you/PRP can/MD make/VB reservations/NNS ./.
My/NNP mom/NN had/VBD the/DT best/JJS meal/NN tonight/NN ,/, the/DT Mini/NNP Tiffin/NNP ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN uppama/NN ,/, mini/NN idlis/NNS in/IN sambar/NN ,/, a/DT mini/NN dosa/NN (/NNS with/IN probably/RB the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN bhaji/NN as/IN my/PRP$ dosa/NN !/NN )/.
and/CC a/DT sweet/NN ./.
The/DT sweet/JJ sheera/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ,/, with/IN cashews/NNS and/CC raisins/NNS ./.
Sad/NNP I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB go/VB for/IN that/DT ./.
PROS/NNS :/: -/JJ nice/NN ambiance/NN ,/, comfortable/JJ booths/NNS -/JJ delicious/JJ ,/, spicy/JJ sambar/NN CONS/NNS :/: -/JJ oily/RB dosas/VBZ with/IN virtually/RB no/DT filling/NN -/JJ crowded/JJ early/NN ,/, stays/NNS that/WDT way/NN through/IN dinner/NN -/JJ NOT/NNP good/NN for/IN groups/NNS (/VBG call/NN ahead/RB )/JJ -/JJ hasty/NN servers/NNS who/WP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB the/DT weather/NN -/JJ miniature/NN food/NN
Great/NNP Masala/NNP Dosa/NNP -/JJ the/DT mustard/NN seed/VBD flavour/NN of/IN the/DT Masala/NNP is/VBZ perfect/NN ./.
The/DT Parotta/NNP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC not/RB excellent/JJ :/: a/DT bit/NN small/JJ and/CC not/RB quite/VB the/DT right/NN flavour/NN compared/VBN to/TO other/JJ Parotta/NNP I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN ./.
The/DT Rasmalai/NNP dessert/NN is/VBZ fantastic/JJ -/JJ although/IN the/DT presentation/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN like/IN the/DT menu/NN picture/NN (/VBD no/DT saffron/NN strands/NNS )/VBP and/CC suffers/VBZ as/IN a/DT result/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB come/VB again/RB if/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
For/IN those/DT new/JJ to/TO South/NNP Indian/NNP food/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT great/JJ introduction/NN ,/, but/CC those/DT who/NNS are/VBP picky/JJ may/MD not/RB like/VB it/PRP as/IN much/RB ./.
We/PRP usually/VBP go/VBN to/TO Anjappar/NNP Chettinad/NNP one/CD weekends/NNS when/WRB I/PRP have/VBP a/DT strong/JJ craving/NN for/IN a/DT South/NNP Indian/NNP breakfast/NN ./.
My/NNP review/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT mild/JJ comparison/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD ./.
We/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/NNP Saravan/NNP Bhavan/NNP a/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/IN as/IN I/PRP like/VBP trying/VBG different/JJ options/NNS ./.
The/DT breakfast/NN buffet/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP is/VBZ from/IN 10-12/JJ and/CC we/PRP had/VBD arrived/VBN at/IN 11:10/CD to/TO quite/VB a/DT line/NN up/IN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN at/IN 11:30/CD ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP noticed/VBD was/VBD that/IN the/DT dosas/NNS ,/, idlis/NNS and/CC vadas/NNS are/VBP much/RB better/JJR than/IN anjappar/JJ and/CC are/VBP really/RB well/RB made/VBN ./.
The/DT sambhar/NN and/CC tomato/NN chutney/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NN I/PRP crave/VBP this/DT breakfast/NN is/VBZ because/IN I/PRP love/VBP Rava/NNP Kesari/NNP and/CC Payasam/NNP ./.
The/DT rava/NN kesari/NN was/VBD quite/JJ tasteless/NN and/CC the/DT payasam/NN seemed/VBD to/TO have/VB been/VBN thickened/VBN with/IN starch/JJ rather/RB than/IN reduced/PDT the/DT way/NN it/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD for/IN two/CD coffees/NNS as/IN we/PRP noticed/VBD that/IN there/EX were/VBD no/DT beverages/NNS in/IN the/DT buffet/NN area/NN (/VBD In/IN comparison/NN ,/, anjapar/NN has/VBZ coffee/NN that/IN you/PRP help/VBP yourself/JJ to/TO )/NN and/CC they/PRP brought/VBP us/PRP two/CD very/RB small/JJ coffees/NNS that/WDT were/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB until/IN it/PRP was/VBD time/NN to/TO pay/VB the/DT bill/NN that/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT 150/NN ml/NN coffees/NNS were/VBD $/$ 2.25/CD each/DT adding/VBG $/$ 4.50/CD to/TO the/DT total/NN ./.
For/IN two/CD people/NNS with/IN coffee/NN the/DT bill/NN came/VBD to/TO $/$ 29.90/CD plus/NNS tip/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP rated/VBN it/PRP two/CD stars/NNS because/IN of/IN the/DT overall/JJ experience/NN -/JJ food/NN ,/, service/NN and/CC pricing/NN ./.
Final/JJ verdict/NN :/: Liked-/NNP vadas/NNS ,/, dosas/NNS ,/, idly/RB ,/, sambhar/NN and/CC taste/NN of/IN the/DT coffee/NN Disliked/VBD :/: Service/NNP ,/, wait/JJ time/NN ,/, pricing/NN ,/, poor/JJ tasting/VBG deserts/NNS ,/, overall/JJ experience/NN ./.
Wo/NNP n't/RB return/NN ./.
Love/NNP the/DT dosas/NN here/RB ./.
The/DT size/NN of/IN a/DT dosa/NN is/VBZ smaller/JJR here/RB but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB cheaper/JJR ./.
A/DT great/JJ bang/NN for/IN your/PRP$ buck/NN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ prompt/JJ and/CC staff/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ usually/RB packed/JJ and/CC is/VBZ also/RB quite/JJ spacious/JJ
Somehow/NNP after/IN we/PRP moved/VBD to/TO Mississauga/NNP this/DT Sarvana/NNP Bhawan/NNP was/VBD just/RB a/DT block/NN from/IN our/PRP$ new/JJ place/NN so/RB obviously/RB we/PRP had/VBD to/TO check/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
Come/NNP from/IN Madras/NNP (/IN the/DT birth/JJ place/NN of/IN this/DT chain/NN )/IN I/PRP would/MD say/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT same/JJ flavour/NN and/CC taste/NN as/IN back/RB home/NN ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB that/DT 's/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/VB out/RP south/JJ Indian/JJ food/NN around/IN here/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP better/VBG options/NNS for/IN sure/JJ ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN good/JJ old/JJ Sarvana/NNP Bhawan/NNP taste/NN this/DT one/CD pretty/NN much/JJ nails/NNS it/PRP bang/NN on/IN ./.
Best/NNP south/NN indian/JJ food/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
Everything/NNP freshly/RB prepared/VBN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP surprised/VBN at/IN all/PDT the/DT negative/JJ reviews/NNS posted/VBD by/IN some/DT members/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ but/CC maybe/JJ due/JJ to/TO the/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN people/NNS ./.
Awesome/NNP authentic/JJ food/NN and/CC well/RB priced/VBN Can/NNP be/VB quite/JJ busy/NN over/IN the/DT weekends/NNS Service/NN can/MD be/VB slow/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN more/RBR than/IN makes/CD up/IN for/IN it/PRP
New/NNP Management/NNP is/VBZ crapy/NN ./.
Quality/NN of/IN food/NN very/RB low/JJ ./.
Used/VBN to/TO a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN this/DT restaurant/NN but/CC will/MD not/RB recommend/VB it/PRP to/TO anybody/NN ./.
Please/NNP dont/VBD eat/JJ there/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN serves/VBZ the/DT pure/NN vegetarian/JJ south/NN Indian/NNP cuisine/NN ../NN even/RB though/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT pure/NN vegetarian/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP eat/JJ out/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN sometimes/NN when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP in/IN a/DT mood/NN for/IN a/DT light/JJ meal/NN ../IN the/DT thing/NN with/IN this/DT kinda/NN food/NN is/VBZ that/IN no/DT matter/NN how/WRB much/JJ you/PRP eat/VB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB makes/VB your/PRP$ stomach/NN go/VB rumbling/NN or/CC feel/VB heavy/JJ ../NN so/IN I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP can/MD go/VB here/RB once/RB in/IN a/DT while/NN ../NN
The/DT ambience/NN is/VBZ n't/RB that/IN great/JJ ../NN some/DT of/IN the/DT tables/NNS are/VBP lined/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT path/NN and/CC I/PRP hate/VB sitting/VBG in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ alright/NN ,/, not/RB the/DT fastest/JJS but/CC reasonable/JJ ./.
Everytime/NNP I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP noticed/VBN that/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ kinda/NN crowded/VBD ../NN so/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN noise/NN but/CC then/RB if/IN I/PRP choose/VBP to/TO eat/VB out/RP then/RB I/PRP should/MD not/RB complain/VB about/IN the/DT noise/NN I/PRP guess/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB looking/VBG for/IN the/DT typical/JJ spicy/NN taste/NN that/WDT Indian/JJ food/NN is/VBZ known/VBN for/IN ./.
Their/NNP spice/NN level/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB low/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB makes/VBZ me/PRP forget/VBD that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB eating/VBG meat/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT carnavore/NN and/CC make/VB few/JJ eceptions/NNS about/IN not/RB having/VBG some/DT meat/NN on/IN my/PRP$ plate/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB miss/VB it/PRP when/WRB I/PRP eat/VBP here/RB ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP only/RB ever/RB gone/NN for/IN the/DT buffet/NN ./.
I/PRP eat/VBP my/JJ vada/NN with/IN sambar/JJ ,/, my/JJ dosa/NN with/IN rice/NN and/CC tomato/NN chutney/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ puri/NN with/IN potato/NN or/CC rice/NN ./.
It/PRP tastes/VBZ amazing/JJ and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB left/VBN without/IN being/VBG so/RB full/IN that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP uncomfortable/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB give/VB them/PRP five/CD stars/NNS is/VBZ because/IN they/PRP need/VBP to/TO expand/VB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB so/RB busy/JJ that/IN the/DT service/NN is/VBZ close/JJ to/TO chaos/NNS ./.
But/CC I/PRP 'd/MD much/RB rather/RB have/VB great/JJ food/NN and/CC slow/NN service/NN than/IN great/JJ service/NN and/CC terrible/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP this/DT place/NN to/TO any/DT meat/NN lover/NN like/IN myself/NN to/TO prove/VB that/IN the/DT occasional/JJ meat/NN free/JJ meal/NN can/MD be/VB very/RB enjoyable/JJ ./.
This/DT was/VBD THE/NNP SHITTIEST/NNP first-dosa-tasting/NN of/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ impossible/JJ to/TO rate/NN my/IN first-tasting/JJ of/IN anything/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP pretty/RB sure/JJ when/WRB you/PRP get/VBP a/DT sour/JJ stomach/NN and/CC horrible/JJ shits/NNS after/IN being/VBG at/IN a/DT restaurant/JJ -/JJ it/PRP was/VBD a/DT horrible/JJ first/JJ experience/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP hope/JJ dosas/NNS do/VBP n't/RB actually/RB taste/VB like/IN what/WP they/PRP did/VBD here/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN item/NN itself/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB that/DT horrible/JJ or/CC else/RB no/DT one/CD would/MD eat/VB it/PRP ,/, right/RB ?/.
But/CC you/PRP see/VBP ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP traumatized/VBN to/TO a/DT point/NN where/WRB I/PRP might/MD not/RB even/RB consider/VB re-evaluating/JJ what/WP they/PRP taste/VBP like/IN and/CC just/RB leave/VB it/PRP at/IN that/DT ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD shoddy/NN ./.
The/DT drink/NN prices/NNS (/VBP non-alcoholic/JJ )/NNS are/VBP shitty/NN for/IN the/DT amount/NN you/PRP get/VB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ close/JJ to/TO nothing/NN ./.
The/DT venue/NN looks/VBZ like/IN a/DT McDonald/NNP 's/POS in/IN an/DT airport/NN food/NN court/NN ./.
If/IN this/DT is/VBZ what/WP they/PRP think/VBP south/JJ India/NNP should/MD be/VB ,/, then/RB I/PRP recommend/VBP that/IN Britain/NNP reoccupy/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP 'd/MD recommend/VB is/VBZ the/DT Madras/NNP coffee/NN ,/, to-go/NN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT one/CD thing/NN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB manage/VB to/TO screw/VB up/RP royally/RB ./.
And/CC paying/VBD $/$ 30/CD for/IN all/DT this/DT ,/, that/DT was/VBD the/DT rotting/NN cherry/NN on/IN top/JJ ./.
The/DT place/NN for/IN Dosa/NNP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ books/NN !/.
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ always/RB provided/VBN the/DT crowds/NNS with/IN some/DT great/JJ vegetarian/JJ food/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN my/PRP$ favourite/JJ ,/, dosas/VBZ !/.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT vegetarian/JJ ,/, but/CC i/NNP would/MD go/VB here/RB for/IN Dosas/NNP as/RB well/RB as/IN other/JJ tasty/NN dishes/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, not/RB the/DT best/NN ,/, but/CC still/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ clean/JJ ,/, and/CC has/VBZ the/DT sink/NN to/TO wash/VB your/PRP$ hands/NNS ,/, without/IN going/NN to/TO the/DT washrooms/NNS .../: a/DT must/NN for/IN your/PRP$ seasoned/JJ foodie/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT poor/JJ version/NN of/IN this/DT esteemed/JJ franchise/NN ./.
Sambhaar/NNP lacked/VBD any/DT tamarind/NN and/CC looked/VBD and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN daal/NN ./.
Chutneys/NNS were/VBD also/RB subpar/JJ ./.
The/DT dosa/NN was/VBD strictly/RB ok/JJ ./.
The/DT Scarborough/NNP branch/NN is/VBZ much/JJ better/NN ./.
Very/NNP disappointed/VBD ./.
I/PRP love/VBP a/DT good/JJ fixin/NN '/'' of/IN dosa/NN every/NN now/RB and/CC then/RB ./.
When/WRB I/PRP do/VBP have/VBP it/PRP ,/, I/PRP always/RB go/VBP in/IN with/IN expectations/NNS (/IN which/WDT I/PRP 'm/VBP working/VBG on/IN )/NN of/IN the/DT dosa/NN rice/NN crepe/NN itself/VBZ having/NN to/TO be/VB crispy/NN ,/, the/DT potato/NN filling/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB spicy/NN and/CC spread/NN evenly/RB inside/VB the/DT dosa/NN crepe/NN ./.

I/PRP guess/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ excuse/NN to/TO try/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
Here/NNP 's/POS what/WP I/PRP found/VBD at/IN Saravanna/NNP Bhavan/NNP :/: -Mom/NNP and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP 2/JJ Spicy/NN Kara/NNP Dosas/NNP ./.
We/PRP found/VBD them/PRP to/TO be/VB rather/RB soggy/JJ and/CC oily/RB -The/JJ potato/NN filling/NN was/VBD blood/JJ red/VBN in/IN color/NN ,/, making/VBG me/PRP think/VBP they/PRP had/VBD added/VBN in/IN a/DT ton/NN of/IN food/NN coloring/VBG -The/NN dosa/NN crepe/NN was/VBD overly/RB thick/JJ -Chutney/NN 's/POS were/VBD okay/NN ;/: however/RB they/PRP really/RB skimped/VBD on/IN it/PRP ./.
