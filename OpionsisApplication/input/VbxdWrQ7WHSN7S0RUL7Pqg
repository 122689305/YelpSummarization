I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN to/TO this/DT place/NN once/RB before/IN and/CC I/PRP remember/VBP not/RB being/VBG impressed/VBN ,/, but/CC then/RB I/PRP drove/VBP to/TO it/PRP again/RB not/RB realizing/VBG it/PRP was/VBD the/DT same/JJ place/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD inside/NN and/CC remembered/VBD ,/, but/CC still/RB decided/VBD to/TO eat/VB there/RB ./.
First/NNP impression/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD loud/VBN inside/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB the/DT best/JJS hear'er/listener/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD having/VBG trouble/NN hearing/NN my/VBD gf/NN right/RB away/RB ./.
We/PRP grabbed/VBD a/DT seat/NN far/RB from/IN the/DT music/speaking/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB quite/JJ loud/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD trivia/NN night/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP could/MD hardly/RB hear/VB the/DT trivia/NN when/WRB we/PRP got/VBD there/RB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD served/VBN pretty/RB quickly/RB and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, was/VBD not/RB as/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT special/NN ,/, the/DT french/NN dip/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT gf/NN got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN tenders/NNS ./.
Mine/NNP was/VBD dry/JJ ,/, I/PRP ran/VBD out/IN of/IN au/NN jus/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB that/IN tasty/NN altogether/RB ./.
I/PRP also/RB had/VBD the/DT beer/NN cheese/NN soup/NN which/WDT was/VBD not/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB great/JJ either/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN tenders/NNS looked/VBD very/RB dry/JJ and/CC the/DT gf/NN did/VBD not/RB finish/VB them/PRP ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD decent/JJ ./.
They/PRP had/VBD a/DT pretty/RB decent/JJ beer/NN selection/NN ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO get/VB some/DT beer/NN and/CC maybe/NN an/DT appetizer/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN would/MD n't/RB be/VB too/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB recommend/VB it/PRP for/IN dinner/NN food/NN ./.
Bruce/NNP is/VBZ right/RB ,/, on/IN all/DT marks/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT great/JJ smoke-free/NN sportsbar/NN for/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP that/IN do/VBP n't/RB live/VB in/IN Madison/NN and/CC do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO fight/NN traffic/NN just/RB to/TO watch/VB the/DT game/NN and/CC toss/NN back/RB a/DT pint/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB for/IN the/DT crowded/JJ nights/NNS and/CC the/DT not-so-crowded/JJ nights/NNS and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN that/IN Byrd/NNP 's/POS always/RB creates/VBZ a/DT great/JJ atmosphere/NN for/IN sports/NNS fans/NNS ./.
They/PRP make/VBP some/DT damn/JJ good/JJ cheese/NN curds/NNS too/RB ,/, eh/NN ./.
Byrds/NNS is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ place/NN to/TO go/VB to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT game/NN and/CC a/DT beer/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ o.k/JJ .../: some/DT things/NNS are/VBP really/RB good/JJ while/IN other/JJ items/NNS are/VBP average/JJ ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP quite/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT fish/JJ fry/NN on/IN Fridays/NNP is/VBZ not/RB worth/VBG the/DT money/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT portions/NNS are/VBP very/RB small/JJ ./.
The/DT chicken/NN wing/VBG special/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP nights/NNS used/VBD to/TO be/VB truly/RB awesome/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP changed/VBD the/DT wings/NNS and/CC now/RB it/PRP pretty/RB much/JJ sucks/NNS ./.
Trivia/NNP night/NN on/IN Wednesday/NNP nights/NNS is/VBZ fun/JJ and/CC it/PRP can/MD also/RB get/VB quite/JJ crowded/JJ during/IN certain/JJ sporting/VBG events/NNS (/IN Packer/NNP and/CC UW/NNP games/NNS )/VBP ./.
The/DT people/NNS who/WP work/NN there/RB really/RB make/VB the/DT place/NN ,/, though/IN ./.
The/DT waitstaff/NN is/VBZ very/RB friendly/RB and/CC some/DT are/VBP quite/JJ easy/NNS on/IN the/DT eyes/NNS !/.
Plus/NNP it/PRP being/VBG non-smoking/JJ makes/NN is/VBZ a/DT GREAT/NNP place/NN to/TO hang/VB out/RP ./.
They/PRP will/MD also/RB sponsor/VB your/PRP$ sports/NNS team/VBP .../IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB give/VB a/DT lot/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP become/VBP a/DT regular/JJ they/PRP will/MD give/VB your/RB team/NN some/DT special/JJ deals/NNS ./.
A/DT great/JJ bar/NN with/IN a/DT decent/JJ selection/NN of/IN beer/NN on/IN tap/NN ./.
The/DT bartenders/NNS are/VBP great/JJ ./.

Just/NNP a/DT tip/NN -/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN a/DT hurry/NN sit/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN or/CC tell/NN your/NN server/NN in/IN advance/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN tends/NNS to/TO be/VB a/DT bit/NN more/RBR relaxed/JJ at/IN the/DT tables/NNS unless/IN you/PRP speak/VB up/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP always/RB enjoyed/VBN places/NNS like/IN Byrd/NNP 's/POS ,/, a/DT relaxed/JJ bar/NN with/IN good/JJ taps/NNS and/CC a/DT broad/JJ menu/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT semi-regular/JJ destination/NN in/IN Fitchburg/NNP ./.

I/PRP definitely/RB prefer/VBP Byrd/NNP 's/POS when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT less/NN of/IN a/DT sardine/NN can/MD to/TO be/VB sure/JJ ./.
The/DT bar/NN is/VBZ a/DT relatively/RB new/JJ establishment/NN in/IN a/DT non-descript/JJ commercial/JJ area/NN near/IN the/DT intersection/NN of/IN PD/NNP and/CC Seminole/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT bit/NN tricky/NN to/TO get/VB into/IN the/DT parking/NN lot/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
You/PRP need/VBP to/TO actually/RB drive/VB past/NN on/IN Seminole/NNP and/CC circle/NN around/IN to/TO the/DT parking/NN lot/NN on/IN the/DT west/JJS side/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN at/IN Byrd/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ pretty/RB broad/JJ ,/, going/VBG beyond/IN the/DT standard/JJ burger/NN and/CC sandwich/JJ offerings/NNS ./.
I/PRP especially/VBP enjoy/JJ the/DT Byrd/NNP 's/POS BLT/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT usual/JJ BLT/NNP ingredients/NNS in/IN a/DT pita/NN with/IN homemade/NN guacamole/NN -/JJ delicious/JJ ./.
My/NNP father/NN usually/RB opts/VBZ for/IN the/DT soup/NN or/CC chili/NN and/CC a/DT salad/NN ./.
The/DT Greek/NNP salad/NN is/VBZ his/PRP$ favorite/JJ just/RB for/IN the/DT olives/NNS alone/RB ./.
I/PRP enjoy/VBP the/DT burgers/NNS and/CC sandwiches/NNS here/RB just/RB as/RB much/JJ as/IN the/DT next/JJ guy/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT few/JJ options/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
For/IN burgers/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT Electric/JJ Green/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT California/Southwest/NNP burger/NN with/IN guacamole/JJ and/CC pepperjack/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN of/IN the/DT style/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT homemade/NN guacamole/NN ./.
The/DT buffalo/NN chicken/NN and/CC the/DT reuben/NN are/VBP also/RB standards/JJ ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ father/NN especially/RB enjoys/VBZ the/DT pork/NN loin/NN ./.
Last/JJ time/NN we/PRP stopped/VBD by/IN on/IN a/DT Monday/NNP ,/, which/WDT happens/NNS to/TO be/VB all-you-can-eat/JJ softshell/NN taco/NN day/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT nicer/JJ features/NNS of/IN Byrd/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ that/IN the/DT entire/JJ place/NN was/VBD non-smoking/JJ from/IN its/PRP$ inception/NN ./.
This/DT alone/NN would/MD put/VB it/PRP near/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN my/PRP$ list/NN for/IN places/NNS in/IN Fitchburg/NNP ./.
There/EX is/VBZ also/RB live/JJ music/JJ on/IN Friday/NNP nights/NNS and/CC other/JJ special/JJ events/NNS from/IN time/NN to/TO time/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT jukebox/NN otherwise/NN ./.
The/DT juke/NN is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT greatest/JJS but/CC the/DT bartenders/NNS seem/VBP to/TO have/VB pretty/RB good/JJ taste/NN ./.
When/WRB a/DT group/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS went/VBD out/RP for/IN a/DT birthday/NN they/PRP let/VBP us/PRP play/NN poker/NN in/IN the/DT corner/NN and/CC the/DT waitress/NN kept/VBD the/DT drinks/NNS flowing/VBG ./.
