I/PRP 'm/VBP all/DT for/IN a/DT little/JJ competition/NN in/IN the/DT crawfish/JJ world/NN -/NN but/CC Cajun/NNP Crawfish/NNP is/VBZ definitely/RB not/RB up/RB for/IN the/DT challenge/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD super/JJ hesitant/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT negative/JJ reviews/NNS ,/, but/CC still/RB kept/VBD in/IN open/JJ mind/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT large/JJ restaurant/NN space/NN with/IN additional/JJ seating/NN in/IN the/DT back/NN around/IN the/DT corner/NN with/IN TVs/NNP abound/NN However/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB sterile/JJ environment/NN ,/, blame/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT high/JJ ceilings/NNS ./.
We/PRP started/VBD out/RP with/IN two/CD pounds/NNS of/IN Crawfish/NNP (/NNP $/$ 9.99/lb/CD )/-NONE- with/IN their/PRP$ House/NNP Special/NNP seasoning/NN and/CC Medium/NNP spice/NN level/NN ./.
(/JJ They/PRP have/VBP a/DT warning/NN that/WDT says/VBZ their/PRP$ ``/`` spicy/NN level/NN is/VBZ two/CD levels/NNS higher/JJR than/IN normal/JJ ''/'' ./. )/''
The/DT Husband/NNP did/VBD ask/VB ahead/RB of/IN time/NN if/IN the/DT crawfish/NN was/VBD big/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT waitress/NN said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD ./.
She/PRP also/RB pointed/VBD out/IN the/DT tank/NN in/IN the/DT back/NN so/IN we/PRP could/MD have/VB a/DT look/NN ./.
(/IN I/PRP did/VBD walk/NN over/IN there/EX to/TO take/VB a/DT peek/NN and/CC noticed/VBD they/PRP had/VBD lobster/NN and/CC clams/NNS in/IN the/DT tanks/NNS too/RB ./. )/''
You/PRP also/RB get/VBP one/CD side/NN of/IN corn/NN and/CC potato/NN for/IN order/NN two/CD pounds/NNS or/CC more/JJR of/IN crawfish/JJ ./.
When/WRB our/JJ order/NN arrived/VBD in/IN a/DT silver/NN bowl/NN ,/, we/PRP noticed/VBD a/DT difference/NN right/NN away/RB ./.
This/DT was/VBD n't/RB the/DT way/NN we/PRP wanted/VBD our/PRP$ crawfish/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT was/VBD our/JJ mistake/NN ./.
The/DT Husband/NNP asked/NN for/IN some/DT lime/NN ,/, salt/NN and/CC pepper/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT dipping/JJ sauce/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN could/MD n't/RB help/VB this/DT crawfish/NN ./.
Sure/NNP ,/, they/PRP were/VBD large/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD also/RB dried/VBD out/IN ./.
There/EX was/VBD no/DT head/NN juice/NN to/TO suck/VB out/RP at/IN all/DT ./.
When/WRB you/PRP break/VB the/DT head/NN off/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD tell/VB there/EX 's/VBZ something/NN wrong/JJ immediately/RB ./.
And/CC the/DT sauce/NN in/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT bowl/NN is/VBZ this/DT watered/JJ down/IN concoction/NN of/IN something/NN or/CC other/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ as/RB fresh/JJ as/IN they/PRP say/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, the/DT ones/NNS in/IN the/DT tank/NN are/VBP just/RB for/IN show/NN I/PRP think/VBP !/.
The/DT staff/NN were/VBD friendly/RB ,/, and/CC really/RB anxious/JJ to/TO refill/NN our/NN beverages/NNS ./.
But/CC it/PRP could/MD n't/RB make/VB up/RP for/IN the/DT sad/JJ crawfish/NN ./.
We/PRP left/VBD after/IN our/PRP$ two/CD pounds/NNS and/CC headed/VBD up/RP Spring/VBG Mountain/NNP for/IN Hot/NNP N/NNP Juicy/NNP Crawfish/NNP instead/RB ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB order/VB the/DT famous/JJ shrimp/NN that/WDT gets/NNS all/PDT the/DT ravings/NNS ,/, but/CC did/VBD see/VB some/DT on/IN someone/NN else/NN 's/POS table/JJ ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD large/JJ indeed/JJ ./.
But/CC then/RB again/RB ,/, this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ called/VBN Cajun/NNP Crawfish/NNP ,/, not/RB Cajun/NNP Shrimp/NNP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD ask/VB if/IN they/PRP had/VBD any/DT grand/NN opening/VBG specials/NNS (/VBP especially/RB since/IN other/JJ yelpers/NNS mentioned/VBN it/PRP )/RB ,/, but/CC we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB offering/VB them/PRP anymore/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP did/VBD notice/JJ an/DT ad/NN offering/NN a/DT discount/NN on/IN beverages/NNS just/RB the/DT other/JJ day/NN ./.
Oh/NNP well/RB ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, Cajun/NNP Crawfish/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB measure/VB up/RP for/IN good/JJ crawfish/NN the/DT way/NN I/PRP like/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP I/PRP took/VBD a/DT butter/NN bath/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN those/DT experiences/NNS where/WRB you/PRP look/VB up/RP afterward/NN ,/, shake/NN your/NN head/NN a/DT little/NN and/CC try/NN to/TO remember/VB where/WRB exactly/RB you/PRP are/VBP ./.
So/RB ,/, perfect/NN ?/.
No/DT ./.
Worth/NNP a/DT try/NN ?/.
I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB say/VB yes/NNS -/JJ especially/RB if/IN you/PRP choose/VBP to/TO bathe/NN with/IN the/DT crab/NN legs/VBZ in/IN garlic/NN butter/NN ./.
Big/NNP jumbo/NNP shrimps/NNS ,/, mmm-mm-mm/NN !/.
The/DT crawfish/NN were/VBD big/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC phenomenal/NN ./.
Cajun/NNP fries/NNS were/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ what/WP the/DT other/JJ reviewer/NN was/VBD talking/VBG about/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT place/NN is/VBZ by/IN far/RB better/JJR than/IN Hot/NNP n/NNS '/POS Juicy/NN ./.
He/she/NNP must/MD 've/VB been/VBN drunk/NN that/IN night/NN of/IN their/PRP$ dining/JJ experience/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ --/: the/DT staff/NN were/VBD all/DT friendly/RB ./.
And/CC hey/NN ,/, they/PRP DO/VBP speak/JJ English/NN !/.
The/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD very/RB clean/JJ and/CC even/RB the/DT restrooms/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO other/JJ crawfish/JJ restaurants/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT Boiling/NNP Crab/NNP and/CC Hot/NNP 'n/NNP Juicy/NNP where/WRB their/PRP$ restrooms/NNS were/VBD disgusting/VBG and/CC infested/VBN with/IN germs/NNS that/IN you/PRP can/MD breath/VB while/IN eating/VBG your/NNS yummy-goodness/JJ food/NN !/.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD cleaaaaaan/JJ and/CC their/PRP$ restrooms/NNS actually/RB smell/VBP nice/JJ ./.
I/PRP took/VBD one/CD star/NN out/IN because/IN I/PRP still/RB prefer/VBP Boiling/VBG Crab/NN over/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
And/CC they/PRP have/VBP this/DT intense/JJ lobster-colored/JJ painted/VBN wall/NN that/IN makes/VBZ it/PRP difficult/-NONE- for/IN the/DT eyes/NNS to/TO adjust/VB ./.
Also/RB ,/, their/PRP$ spicy-ness/NN factor/NN is/VBZ a/DT couple/NN of/IN levels/NNS higher/JJR than/IN normal/JJ ./.
I/PRP can/MD usually/RB take/VB a/DT Medium/NN (/NN at/IN most/JJS )/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT Mild/NNP was/VBD already/RB spicy/JJ enough/RB ./.
I/PRP really/VBP recommend/JJ this/DT place/NN ./.
They/PRP hold/VBD up/RP to/TO the/DT Hot/NNP 'n/NNP Juicy/NNP competition/NN because/IN Cajun/NNP Crawfish/NNP 's/POS foods/NNS are/VBP BOMB/NNP and/CC JUICIER/NNP !/.
P.S/NNP ./.
THEY/NNP DO/NNP HAVE/NNP WETNAPS/NNP !/.
:/: )/.
Went/NNP here/RB again/RB ,/, still/RB think/IN they/PRP have/VBP by/IN far/RB the/DT best/JJS soft/NN shell/NN crab/NN ./.
The/DT batter/NN is/VBZ just/RB right/RB ,/, not/RB too/RB salty/JJ and/CC not/RB too/RB breaded/VBN !/.
My/NNP bf/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN here/RB about/IN 5/CD times/NNS and/CC always/RB get/VB great/JJ service/NN !/.
The/DT prices/NNS did/VBD go/VB up/RB though/IN ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ understandable/JJ because/IN of/IN the/DT oil/NN leak/NN ./.
A/DT lbs/NNS of/IN shrimp/NN is/VBZ $/$ 12.95/CD a/DT lbs/NN of/IN clams/NNS was/VBD $/$ 11.95/CD Soft/CD shell/NN crab/NN $/$ 9.95/CD same/JJ The/DT clams/NNS is/VBZ something/NN new/JJ that/IN was/VBD on/IN the/DT menu/NN so/IN we/PRP tried/VBP it/PRP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
We/PRP tried/VBD this/DT place/NN for/IN dinner/NN ,/, and/CC soooo/RB glad/JJ we/PRP did/VBD ./.
At/IN first/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB too/RB happy/VB with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB the/DT mayo/NN ./.
My/NNP bf/NN has/VBZ a/DT sauce/NN that/IN he/PRP makes/VBZ that/IN uses/NN mayo/NN as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT ingredient/JJ to/TO make/VB the/DT best/JJS sauce/JJ ever/NNS to/TO dip/VB those/DT little/JJ crawfish/NN tails/NNS into/IN ./.
However/RB ,/, after/IN tasting/VBG the/DT crawfish/NN ,/, no/DT sauce/NN was/VBD needed/VBN ./.
This/DT place/NN definitely/RB has/VBZ different/JJ flavors/NNS than/IN that/DT of/IN HnJ/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP love/VBP it/PRP !/.
We/PRP (/VBP the/DT two/CD of/IN us/PRP )/VBP ordered/VBN 4lbs/NNS of/IN the/DT medium/NN house/NN special/NN and/CC 2/CD lbs/NNS of/IN the/DT medium/NN house/NN special/JJ shrimps/NNS ./.
They/PRP were/VBD all/DT so/RB FRESH/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD never/RB a/DT shrimp/JJ kind/NN of/IN girl/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT place/NN made/VBD it/PRP so/RB yummy/RB ,/, that/IN I/PRP actually/RB prefer/VBP the/DT shrimp/NN over/IN the/DT crawfish/NN !/.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD pretty/RB slow/JJ though/IN :/: (/IN If/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB watching/JJ my/NN cholesterol/NN intake/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD eat/VB at/IN this/DT crawfish/JJ joint/NN every/DT single/JJ weekend/NN !/.
But/CC since/IN I/PRP am/VBP somewhat/JJ health/NN conscious/NN ,/, once/RB every/DT two/CD months/NNS is/VBZ my/JJ limit/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD to/TO Cajun/NNP Crawfish/NNP a/DT couple/NN of/IN days/NNS ago/IN ./.
Although/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD empty/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD surprised/VBN by/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP butter/NN and/CC garlic/JJ shrimp/NN ,/, snow/NN crab/NN and/CC oysters/NNS with/IN sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.
They/PRP were/VBD all/DT very/RB good/JJ ./.
Ginormous/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB begin/VB to/TO describe/VB the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT shrimp/NN ./.
We/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB to/TO this/DT place/NN the/DT next/JJ time/NN we/PRP 're/VBP in/IN Vegas/NNP ./.
So/IN I/PRP was/VBD craving/VBG seafood/NN and/CC didnt/VB feel/NNS like/IN paying/VBG an/DT arm/NN &/CC a/DT leg/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.
Decided/NNP to/TO go/VB here/RB instead/RB of/IN to/TO its/PRP$ competitor/NN Hot/NN N/NNP Juicy/NNP Crawfish/NNP because/IN this/DT place/NN accepts/NNS Restaurant.com/VBP coupons/NNS ./.
Specifically/RB wanted/VBD the/DT cajun/NN clams/NNS ,/, the/DT fresh/JJ shrimp/NN ,/, the/DT crab/NN legs/NNS ./.
Got/NNP there/EX around/IN 8pm/CD on/IN Sunday/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT fresh/JJ seafood/NN ,/, all/DT they/PRP had/VBD was/VBD the/DT clams/NNS ,/, the/DT blue/JJ crabs/NNS and/CC the/DT dungeness/NN crabs/NNS ./.
They/PRP had/VBD crawfish/JJ but/CC those/DT were/VBD frozen/VBN (/NN and/CC not/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT fresh/JJ ones/NNS )/NN ./.
Ended/NNP up/RB ordering/VBG a/DT pound/NN of/IN cajun/NN clams/NNS ,/, the/DT calamari/NN basket/NN ,/, the/DT butterfly/JJ shrimp/NN basket/NN and/CC an/DT order/NN of/IN sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS ./.
The/DT cajun/NN clams/NNS were/VBD awesome/JJ !/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.
The/DT other/JJ stuff/NN was/VBD just/RB OK./RB Total/JJ bill/NN (/NNP food/NNP &/CC tax/NNP )/NNP came/VBD out/RP to/TO $/$ 40/CD ./.

Not/RB a/DT bad/NN for/IN some/DT good/JJ seafood/NN ./.
Also/RB service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
1/CD star/NN for/IN their/PRP$ cajun/NN clams/NNS 1/VBP star/NN for/IN the/DT restaurant.com/NN coupon/NN 1/CD star/NN for/IN good/JJ service/NN
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB Friday/JJ night/NN because/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB time/NN to/TO wait/VB an/DT hour/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ at/IN Hot/NNP N/NNP Juicy/NNP ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT Blue/NN Moon/NNP and/CC the/DT girls/NNS ordered/VBP sodas/RB ./.
Our/NNP server/NN brought/VBD out/RP the/DT sodas/NNS ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ Blue/NN Moon/NNP was/VBD no/DT where/NN in/IN sight/NN ./.
She/PRP comes/VBZ back/RP a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS later/JJ to/TO tell/NN me/NNS that/IN they/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN Blue/NNP Moon/NNP .../: so/RB disappointed/JJ already/RB ./.
What/WP we/PRP ordered/VBP :/: 2/CD lbs/NNS crawfish/JJ -/JJ 1/CD lb/NN house/NN special/JJ sauce/1/CD lb/NN garlic/JJ butter/NN sauce/NN 1/CD lb/NN shrimp/NN -/JJ garlic/NN butter/NN sauce/NN snow/NN crab/NN -/JJ garlic/NN butter/NN sauce/NN sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/VBZ extra/JJ corn/potato/NN The/DT crawfish/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ./.

She/PRP goes/VBZ back/RB to/TO tell/VB the/DT manager/NN again/RB and/CC returns/NNS to/TO tell/NN us/NNS that/IN they/PRP are/VBP out/IN of/IN potatoes/NNS and/CC stands/NNS there/RB for/IN a/DT minute/JJ without/NN saying/VBG anything/NN ./.
I/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` it/PRP 's/VBZ ok/JJ ''/'' and/CC she/PRP finally/RB walks/VBZ away/RB ./.
The/DT sauce/NN with/IN the/DT shrimp/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT shrimp/NN were/VBD over/IN cooked/JJ and/CC tough/JJ ./.
The/DT crab/NN legs/VBZ come/NN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP not/RB pre-cracked/JJ for/IN us/PRP ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO flag/NN down/IN a/DT server/NN to/TO ask/VB for/IN crackers/NNS ./.
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ been/VBN open/JJ for/IN a/DT while/NN now/RB .../: why/NNS are/VBP the/DT servers/NNS so/RB inexperienced/VBD ?/.
Why/WRB do/VBP they/PRP not/RB have/VBP potatoes/NNS or/CC Blue/VB Moon/NNP on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ?/.
If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB potatoes/NNS ,/, should/MD n't/RB you/VB tell/VBP the/DT server/NN to/TO ask/VB the/DT customer/NN if/IN they/PRP would/MD like/VB something/NN else/NN ./.
