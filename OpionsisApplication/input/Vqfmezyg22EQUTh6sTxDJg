We/PRP disputed/VBD the/DT transaction/NN just/RB for/IN the/DT point/NN because/IN I/PRP hate/VBP to/TO see/VB them/PRP get/VB away/RB with/IN that/DT ./.
Very/NNP disturbing/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB deserve/VB your/PRP$ business/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD be/VB my/JJ go/NN to/TO from/IN now/RB on/IN ./.
After/IN visiting/NN here/RB yesterday/NN ,/, I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT customer/NN service/NN is/VBZ n't/RB that/DT good/JJ ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB refills/NNS of/IN water/NN up/IN until/IN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO leave/NNP and/CC never/RB got/VBD a/DT refreshment/NN of/IN ginger/JJR and/CC wasabi/NN for/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN sushi/NN and/CC rolls/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP ./.

We/PRP order/VBP too/RB many/JJ salmon/JJ sashimi/NN for/IN my/VBN child/NN by/IN accident/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP almost/RB finish/JJ lunch/NN ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO help/VB her/PRP out/IN because/IN we/PRP hate/VBP wasting/VBG food/NN ,/, she/PRP came/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC yell/JJ at/IN us/PRP and/CC wanted/VBD to/TO charged/VBN me/PRP $/$ 18.99/CD (/CD deluxe/JJ adult/NN price/NN )/NNS ./.
Instead/RB she/PRP charge/VBD $/$ 3.50/CD per/CD salmon/NN sashimi/NN I/PRP ate/VBP ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP their/PRP$ policy/NN but/CC my/PRP$ child/NN is/VBZ only/RB 8/CD !/.
Oh/NNP and/CC they/PRP charge/VBP tea/NN for/IN $/$ 2/CD !/CD
Never/NNP coming/VBD back/RB here/RB ./.
Discriminatory/NNP new/JJ ``/`` rules/NNS ''/'' ruin/VB the/DT experience/NN ./.
Used/VBN to/TO be/VB somewhat/JJ regular/JJ for/IN the/DT ayce/NN menu/NN as/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB bad/JJ and/CC the/DT price/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO be/VB fair/NN ./.
Went/NNP tonight/NN with/IN my/JJ girlfriend/NN who/WP always/RB opts/VBZ for/IN the/DT sashimi/NN for/IN $/$ 2/CD extra/NN ./.
Fair/NNP enough/RB ,/, pay/VBP a/DT little/JJ extra/NN for/IN the/DT premium/NN items/NNS ./.
Reminded/JJ the/DT server/NN that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP vegetarian/JJ and/CC will/MD just/RB get/VB the/DT usual/JJ normal/JJ ayce/NN ./.
The/DT server/NN acknowledged/VBD she/PRP recognized/VBD us/PRP and/CC explained/VBD the/DT new/JJ rule/NN if/IN one/CD person/NN wants/VBZ sashimi/JJ the/DT vegetarian/NN who/WP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB eating/VBG any/DT fish/JJ at/IN all/DT is/VBZ getting/VBG charged/VBN the/DT same/JJ premium/NN for/IN the/DT privilege/NN for/IN sitting/VBG at/IN the/DT same/JJ table/JJ ./.
Not/RB in/IN those/DT words/NNS obviously/RB ,/, but/CC we/PRP definitely/RB made/VBD sure/JJ we/NNS were/VBD on/IN the/DT same/JJ page/NN before/IN being/VBG given/VBN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS to/TO think/VB it/PRP over/IN ./.
Contemplated/NNP walking/NN out/IN but/CC decided/VBD to/TO stick/VB around/IN as/IN the/DT tea/NN was/VBD already/RB poured/VBN ./.
Usually/RB we/PRP tip/VBP around/IN 20/CD percent/NN when/WRB we/PRP went/VBD here/RB as/IN I/PRP always/RB feel/VBP at/IN ayce/RB the/DT servers/NNS need/VBP to/TO do/VB a/DT little/RB more/RBR running/JJ around/NN ./.
Gave/NNP 10/NNP tonight/NN ,/, the/DT difference/NN being/VBG more/JJR than/IN the/DT $/$ 2/CD but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT principal/NN ,/, felt/VBD a/DT little/JJ bad/NN but/CC I/PRP was/VBD still/RB annoyed/VBN ./.
This/DT has/VBZ cost/VBN them/PRP regular/JJ customers/NNS and/CC any/DT future/JJ recommendations/NNS to/TO friends/NNS or/CC family/NN ./.
A/DT shame/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT proximity/NN to/TO work/NN and/CC home/NN ./.
Dropped/NNP into/IN Sushi/NNP Huang/NNP for/IN lunch/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ sign/NN ./.
Good/NNP honest/VBD to/TO goodness/NN ALCE/NNP sushi/NNP at/IN a/DT very/RB reasonable/JJ price/NN ./.
The/DT teriyaki/NN salmon/NN was/VBD very/RB moist/JJ and/CC succulent/JJ ,/, so/RB often/RB it/PRP is/VBZ cooked/VBN to/TO a/DT frazzle/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ in/IN spite/NN of/IN being/VBG so/RB busy/NN ./.
