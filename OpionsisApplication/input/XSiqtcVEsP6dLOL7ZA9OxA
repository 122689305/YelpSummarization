My/NNP boyfriend/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG me/PRP here/RB tonight/NN because/IN we/PRP 're/VBP celebrating/VBG something/NN and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD ,/, ``/`` all/DT I/PRP want/VBP is/VBZ Kenzo/NNP ./. ''/''
Even/RB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO wait-/JJ it/PRP 's/VBZ rarely/RB for/IN very/RB long/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN the/DT seafood/NN ramen/NN (/IN I/PRP forget/VBP the/DT actual/JJ name/NN of/IN it/PRP and/CC I/PRP picked/VBD the/DT squid/JJ out/NN )/NN ,/, which/WDT gave/-NONE- me/VBZ acid/JJ reflux/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD soooo/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT King/NNP of/IN King/NNP Ramen/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ spicy/NN to/TO say/VB the/DT least-/NN but/CC delicious/JJ ./.
My/NNP favourite/NN is/VBZ the/DT Wonton/NNP Ramen-/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB in/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT poster/NN of/IN it/PRP on/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.

At/IN least/JJS as/RB good/JJ as/IN Kinton/NNP ,/, only/RB you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO wait/VB 3/JJ hours/NNS to/TO get/VB a/DT seat/NN ./.
Admittedly/RB ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT ramen/NN connoisseur/NN but/CC felt/VBD that/IN this/DT restaurant/NN offers/VBZ good/JJ quality/NN ingredients/NNS ,/, generous/JJ portions/NNS ,/, and/CC an/DT inviting/NN ambiance/NN at/IN an/DT affordable/JJ price/NN ./.
If/IN anything/NN ,/, the/DT broth/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT salty/NN side/NN ,/, but/CC perhaps/RB that/IN 's/POS just/RB how/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT king/NN of/IN kings/NNS ramen/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD just/RB spicy/JJ enough/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ liking/NN and/CC rich/NN enough/RB to/TO satiate/VB my/JJ hunger/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
Kenzo/NNP Ramen/NNP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ soup/NN place/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN too/RB much/JJ Pho/NNP ,/, Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO find/VB an/DT alternative/NN to/TO my/PRP$ staple/NN soup/RB eating/VBG patterns/NNS ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ bowl/NN of/IN mixed/NN ingredients/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ way/NN to/TO please/VB my/PRP$ complexity/NN loving/VBG pallet/NN ./.

Kenzo/NNP Ramen/NNP thank/NN you/PRP for/IN popping/VBG my/NNS first/RB ramen/VBP experience/NN cherry/NN !/.
The/DT location/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC just/RB walking/VBG distance/NN from/IN Wellesley/NNP station/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP to/TO wait/VB a/DT bit/NN before/IN you/PRP can/MD eat/VB your/PRP$ ramen/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD steaming/VBG hot/NN !/.
The/DT broth/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT ramen/NN was/VBD great/JJ but/CC I/PRP was/VBD told/RB later/JJ than/IN Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ middle/NN of/IN the/DT road/NN for/IN Japanese/JJ standards/NNS ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT best/JJS ramen/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/JJ but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ it/PRP job/VB at/IN 10/CD bucks/NNS a/DT bowl/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ only/RB 50/CD cents/NNS to/TO add/VB an/DT extra/JJ egg/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ viable/JJ options/NNS on/IN Dundas/NNP between/IN Spadina/NNP and/CC Yonge/NNP St./NNP ,/, and/CC a/DT plausible/JJ destination/NN at/IN which/WDT to/TO recharge/VB after/IN a/DT day/NN of/IN horrible/JJ ,/, horrible/JJ ,/, but/CC unavoidable/JJ shopping/NN in/IN the/DT Eaton/NNP Centre/NNP or/CC visiting/VBG the/DT AGO/NNP if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO venture/NN into/IN Chinatown/NNP ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT dead/NN of/IN winter/NN ./.

The/DT servings/NNS are/VBP *humongous*/-NONE- --/: bring/IN an/DT appetite/NN ,/, or/CC prepare/NN to/TO be/VB defeated/VBN and/CC exhausted/VBN as/IN you/PRP dive/VBP into/IN a/DT bottomless/JJ bowl/NN ./.
The/DT noodles/NNS are/VBP passable/JJ ;/: I/PRP 've/VBP certainly/RB had/VBD better/VBN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN ,/, who/WP recently/RB ate/VBP his/PRP$ way/NN through/IN Japan/NNP ,/, said/VBD it/PRP compares/VBZ favourably/RB with/IN what/WP you/PRP 'll/MD get/VB at/IN most/JJS places/NNS there/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD rate/VB it/PRP just/RB slightly/RB lower/JJR than/IN my/PRP$ favourite/NN of/IN all/DT time/NN ,/, Saiwaii/NNP Ramen/NNP in/IN SF/NNP ./.
The/DT Osaka/NNP octupus/VBZ balls/NNS are/VBP *insanely*/VBG rich/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB six/VB is/VBZ far/RB too/RB many/JJ for/IN two/CD people/NNS ,/, consisting/VBG as/IN they/PRP do/VBP of/IN soft/NN cheese/NN (/IN I/PRP only/RB found/VBD out/IN later/JJ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ what/WP they/PRP are/VBP made/VBN of/IN .../: glad/JJ I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB before/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP them/PRP .../: also/RB since/IN when/WRB do/JJ Japanese/JJ dishes/NNS involve/VBP dairy/JJ ?/NN !/NN ?/. )/.

I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT shaved/VBN dry/JJ octopus/NNS on/IN top/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT cheap/NN fill-up/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ probably/RB the/DT best/JJS value/NN in/IN this/DT neighbourhood/NN (/NN which/WDT exploits/NNS suburban/JJ shoppers/NNS who/WP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO venture/NN too/RB far/RB from/IN Yonge/NNP &/CC Dundas/NNP when/WRB they/PRP come/VBP to/TO town/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB worth/VB a/DT visit/NN if/IN you/PRP live/VBP elsewhere/RB in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
The/DT tables/NNS are/VBP small/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB busy/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/RB recommend/VB it/PRP for/IN a/DT party/NN of/IN more/JJR than/IN 2-3/CD ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Tonkotsu/NNP Ramen/NNP and/CC the/DT soup/NN and/CC the/DT pork/NN were/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT noodles/NNS not/RB so/RB much/RB ./.
And/CC I/PRP also/RB order/VBD Gyoza/NNP and/CC they/PRP were/VBD amazing/VBG !/NNS !/.
I/PRP would/MD need/VB to/TO try/VB other/JJ ramen/NNS to/TO rate/NN better/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP have/VBP plenty/NN of/IN types/NNS of/IN different/JJ ramen/NNS ./.

Yet/NN to/TO say/VB I/PRP tried/RB this/DT out/NN of/IN the/DT blue/JJ one/CD cold/NN winters/NNS day/NN after/IN shopping/NN ./.
I/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP the/DT service/NN was/VBD well/RB eventho/NN it/PRP was/VBD busy/NN and/CC the/DT portion/NN sizes/VBZ for/IN the/DT noodle/NN is/VBZ well/RB worth/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP like/IN to/TO say/VB I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT huge/JJ fan/NN of/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Broth/NNP is/VBZ very/RB nice/JJ (/NN though/IN a/DT tad/NN salty/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN )/NN ./.
Noodles/NNS are/VBP n't/RB chewy/JJ enough/RB for/IN my/NN taste/NN but/CC still/RB good/JJ ./.
Meat/NNP and/CC vegetables/NNS and/CC such/JJ are/VBP pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
They/PRP messed/VBD up/RP my/PRP$ order/NN ./.
Then/RB you/PRP have/VBP to/TO explain/VB over/RP and/CC over/IN again/RB what/WP they/PRP did/VBD wrong/RB ./.

Craving/VBG ramen/NNS for/IN awhile/JJ since/IN its/PRP$ hard/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO get/VB good/JJ ramen/NN in/IN town/NN ./.
First/NNP stop/NNP visiting/VBG downtown/NN Toronto/NNP was/VBD Kenzo/NNP Ramen/NNP ./.
To/TO be/VB fair/JJ ,/, from/IN the/DT outside/JJ it/PRP resembles/VBZ any/DT other/JJ ordinary/JJ ramen/NNS shop/VBP lined/VBN along/IN Dundas/NNP Ave/NNP ./.
While/IN not/RB completely/RB Japanese/JJ owned/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO hold/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ and/CC have/VBP a/DT loyal/JJ fan/JJ base/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Tonkotsu/NNP ,/, Broth/NNP was/VBD tasty/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ,/, not/RB to/TO mention/NN healthy/NN ./.
No/DT MSG/NN from/IN what/WP I/PRP can/MD tell/VB ,/, noodles/NNS were/VBD firmly/RB cooked/JJ ,/, not/RB too/RB soft/JJ or/CC mushy/JJ ./.

I/PRP like/VBP how/WRB their/PRP$ chopsticks/NNS are/VBP not/RB the/DT cheap/NN wooden/NN ones/NNS ./.
The/DT matcha/NN smoothie/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN good/JJ but/CC i/JJ think/NN its/PRP$ more/RBR on/IN how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD done/VBN

Overall/IN I/PRP would/MD say/VB this/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT fairly/RB standard/JJ when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO ramen/NNS ;/: the/DT pork/NN was/VBD tender/RB ,/, the/DT egg/NN was/VBD not/RB overcooked/VBN ,/, the/DT noodles/NNS were/VBD nice/RB and/CC chewy/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD their/PRP$ King/NN of/IN Kings/NNS ramen/NNS and/CC the/DT broth/NN was/VBD flavourful/JJ but/CC missing/NN that/IN depth/NN and/CC richness/NN you/PRP get/VB from/IN a/DT really/RB good/JJ broth/NN ,/, but/CC again/RB it/PRP was/VBD overall/JJ decent/NN -/JJ the/DT ramen/NN itself/PRP also/RB had/VBD lots/NNS of/IN other/JJ stuff/NN in/IN it/PRP as/RB well/RB (/IN veggies/NNS ,/, seaweed/VBD ,/, ground/NN pork/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD quick/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ,/, although/IN I/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN two/CD tables/NNS eating/VBG at/IN that/DT time/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP definitely/RB better/RBR ramen/JJ places/NNS in/IN the/DT city/NN ,/, but/CC overall/JJ Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ not/RB bad/JJ if/IN you/PRP want/VBP a/DT quick/JJ bite/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ alright/JJ -/JJ portions/NNS are/VBP bigger/JJR than/IN Santosei/NNP but/CC quality/NN is/VBZ lower/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN Kinton/NNP ./.
In/IN a/DT pinch/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD do/VB to/TO quelch/VB any/DT ramen/NN cravings/NNS ./.
Not/RB real/JJ Japanese/JJ food/NN including/VBG donburi/NN and/CC ramen/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB go/VB back/RB and/CC try/VB the/DT other/JJ varities/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD so/RB happy/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN every/DT other/JJ patron/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD Japanese/JJ or/CC Korean/NNP ./.

Rather/RB disappointed/JJ overall/JJ though/NN ,/, The/DT king/NN of/IN kings/NNS ramen/VBN had/VBD a/DT tasteless/JJ instant/NN noodle/NN tasting/VBG broth/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD as/IN if/IN someone/NN mixed/NN water/NN with/IN chill/NN oil/NN ./.

Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ ramen/NN place/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP that/IN rarely/RB ever/RB has/VBZ line/VBN ups/NNS and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ super/NN quick/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB going/RB with/IN their/PRP$ recommended/JJ menu/NN options/NNS as/IN they/PRP truly/RB are/VBP delicious/JJ !/.
My/NNP girlfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP came/VBD here/RB on/IN February/NNP 24/NNP at/IN around/NNP 2PM/CD ./.
When/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD n't/RB that/IN packed/VBN and/CC only/RB 3/JJ tables/NNS were/VBD filled/VBN ./.
After/IN we/PRP sat/VBP down/RB ,/, a/DT mob/NN of/IN people/NNS came/VBD in/IN and/CC almost/RB half/DT of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD filled/VBN !/.
After/IN we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN ,/, we/PRP took/VBD a/DT quick/JJ glance/NN at/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC decided/VBD what/WP to/TO order/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ and/CC took/VBD our/NN orders/NNS promptly/RB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT Nagasaki/NNP Champon/NNP (/NNP Seafood/NNP )/NNP and/CC my/NNP girlfriend/NN went/VBD with/IN ``/`` The/DT Kings/NNS of/IN the/DT Kings/NNS Ramen/VBN ''/'' (/IN she/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB fancy/JJ )/NN !/.
I/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT Matcha/NNP Green/NNP Tea/NNP Smoothie/NNP ./.
My/NNP green/VBD tea/NN smoothie/NN took/VBD about/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS to/TO come/VB out/RP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN too/RB bland/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./.
It/PRP had/VBD a/DT milky/JJ but/CC not/RB too/RB sweet/JJ green/JJ tea/NN taste/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC just/RB not/RB my/VB kind/NN of/IN drink/NN ./.
Our/NNP food/NN came/VBD out/RP probably/RB around/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS after/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP it/PRP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ n't/RB too/RB bad/JJ ./.
My/NNP seafood/VBD ramen/VBN was/VBD awesome/JJ ,/, mostly/RB because/IN I/PRP love/VBP seafood/NN and/CC the/DT soup/NN base/NN tasted/VBN great/JJ ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT decent/JJ amount/NN of/IN seafood/NN (/NN Shrimp/NNP ,/, scallops/NNS ,/, and/CC mussels/NNS )/NNS and/CC noodles/NNS ./.
One/CD minor/NN complaint/NN I/PRP have/VBP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT shrimp/NN should/MD be/VB unshelled/JJ ,/, this/DT makes/NN it/PRP easier/VBD to/TO eat/VB especially/RB when/WRB eating/JJ ramen/NN .../: or/CC maybe/VB I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB picky/JJ !/.
As/IN for/IN my/PRP$ girlfriend/NN (/IN she/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT picky/JJ eater/JJ )/NNS ,/, she/PRP thought/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB okay/JJ ./.
They/PRP could/MD have/VB gave/VBN less/JJR toppings/NNS ,/, primarily/RB the/DT bean/JJ sprouts/NNS because/IN it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN there/NNS were/VBD more/JJR of/IN that/DT than/IN noodles/NNS ./.
Another/DT thing/NN is/VBZ that/IN she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB the/DT smokey/NN flavor/NN of/IN the/DT pork/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT depends/NNS on/IN your/PRP$ taste/NN ./.
One/CD thing/NN that/IN we/PRP both/VBP agree/NN on/IN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT noodles/NNS had/VBD a/DT great/JJ texture/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD an/DT awesome/JJ smooth/NN and/CC soft/NN texture/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD our/PRP$ waitress/NN did/VBD a/DT great/JJ job/NN ./.
She/PRP accommodated/VBD with/IN our/PRP$ requests/NNS and/CC was/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ ./.
She/PRP came/VBD back/RB often/RB enough/RB to/TO not/RB annoy/VB us/PRP ,/, but/CC enough/RB for/IN us/PRP to/TO request/VB items/NNS if/IN we/PRP needed/VBP ./.
Our/NNP ramens/NNS did/VBD n't/RB come/VB out/RP quick/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB so/RB long/RB that/IN we/PRP would/MD complain/VB ./.
We/PRP also/RB got/VBD a/DT coupon/NN for/IN 5/CD $/$ off/CD 25/CD $/$ the/DT next/JJ time/NN we/PRP visit/NN :/: )/NNP Overall/NNP ,/, I/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ time/NN and/CC meal/NN at/IN Kenzo/NNP ./.
If/IN I/PRP am/VBP ever/RB in/IN the/DT Toronto/NNP area/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB come/VB back/RB here/RB and/CC try/VB the/DT other/JJ ramen/NNS ./.
Not/RB only/RB was/VBD the/DT is/VBZ service/NN great/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.
Definitely/RB a/DT place/NN to/TO check/NN out/IN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP around/IN the/DT Toronto-Downtown/JJ area/NN ./.
Well/NNP this/DT place/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB understand/VB the/DT high/JJ ratings/NNS ./.
I/PRP found/VBD their/PRP$ soup/NN to/TO be/VB slightly/RB salty/JJ and/CC the/DT portions/NNS somewhat/VBP small/JJ for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
But/CC like/IN the/DT other/JJ reviews/NNS mention/NN ,/, the/DT service/NN was/VBD EXCELLENT/NNP ./.
Super/NNP attentive/JJ staff/NN ./.
LOVED/NNP this/DT place/NN !/NN !/.
Everyone/NNP was/VBD super/JJ friendly/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP even/RB chatted/VBN with/IN a/DT couple/NN that/WDT was/VBD seated/VBN nearby/JJ ./.
So/RB ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT ramen/JJ contest/NN here-eat/NN an/DT entire/NN bowl/NN at/IN a/DT level/NN 20/NN in/IN regards/NNS to/TO its/PRP$ spiciness/NN ,/, and/CC get/VB it/PRP for/IN free/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN warned/VBD us/PRP that/IN it/PRP was/VBD REALLY/NNP spicy/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP got/VBD a/DT level/NN 2/IN (/JJ I/PRP was/VBD sweatin/JJ '/NN a/DT bit/NN ,/, to/TO tell/NN you/PRP the/DT truth/NN !/.
And/CC I/PRP always/RB get/VBP spicy/JJ ramen/NNS that/WDT never/RB tastes/VBZ that/IN spicy/NN !/VBD !/NNP )/NNP
with/IN pork/NN and/CC mushrooms/NNS ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ boo/NN got/VBD a/DT level/NN 6/IN (/NN I/PRP think/VBP that/DT was/VBD the/DT 1st/CD tier/NN haha/NN )/NN ./.
He/PRP was/VBD dying/VBG and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT few/JJ spoonfuls/NNS and/CC YES/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD THAT/NNP spicy/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB tasty/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS !/.
We/PRP also/RB got/VBD an/DT order/NN of/IN the/DT gyoza/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD huge/JJ size/NN wise/NN !/.
I/PRP love/VBP soups/NNS and/CC sometimes/RB ignorance/NN can/MD truly/RB be/VB bliss/NNS ./.
I/PRP know/VBP my/JJ way/NN around/IN Pho/NNP 's/POS and/CC Pork/NNP Bone/NNP soups/NNS ,/, however/RB Ramen/RB ,/, I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB much/JJ except/IN that/IN I/PRP enjoy/VBP them/PRP ./.
As/IN such/JJ ,/, I/PRP do/VBP happen/VBN to/TO like/IN Kenzo/NNP ./.
Both/DT times/NNS I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN there/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ location/NN has/VBZ been/VBN mostly/RB empty/JJ --/: including/VBG dinner/NN time/NN here/RB ,/, so/RB I/PRP would/MD take/VB most/JJ people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB know/VB about/IN this/DT location/NN yet/RB ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ listed/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ website/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP was/VBD there/RB I/PRP had/VBD a/DT Netsu/NNP Ramen/NNP which/WDT --/: with/IN limited/JJ experience/NN found/NN to/TO be/VB very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN I/PRP had/VBD their/PRP$ Orochong/NNP (/NNP 'cause/VB youth/JJ love/JJ it/PRP ;/: -/JJ )/NN .../: which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD good/JJ but/CC I/PRP actually/RB preferred/VBN their/PRP$ Netsu/NNP better/NNP ./.
Mind/IN you/PRP that/IN is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN of/IN taste/NN ,/, not/RB quality/RB ./.
On/IN a/DT positive/JJ note/NN ,/, the/DT waiter/NN came/VBD after/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN and/CC asked/VBD what/WP we/PRP thought/VBP of/IN it/PRP ./.
If/IN perhaps/RB it/PRP was/VBD too/RB salty/JJ or/CC if/IN there/EX was/VBD anything/NN they/PRP could/MD do/VB to/TO improve/VB the/DT dish/JJ .../NN ./. WHAT/NNP ?/.
Really/RB ?/.
For/IN better/NN or/CC worse/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB even/RB remember/VB when/WRB was/VBD the/DT last/JJ time/NN I/PRP was/VBD asked/VBN that/IN in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD appreciated/VBN ,/, however/RB due/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN Ramen/NNP experience/NN ,/, I/PRP really/RB could/MD not/RB give/VB any/DT meaningful/JJ feedback/NN ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN quality/NN ,/, I/PRP could/MD not/RB how/VB ``/`` authentic/JJ ''/'' it/PRP was/VBD ./.
I/PRP could/MD only/RB assume/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB ./.
But/CC unlike/JJ places/NNS like/IN Pho88/CD ,/, where/WRB their/PRP$ pho/NN is/VBZ neither/DT authentic/JJ or/CC that/DT well/RB made/VBN ,/, this/DT simile/NN of/IN Ramen/NNP was/VBD quite/JJ delicious/JJ given/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ lack/NN of/IN authenticness/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN to/TO Japan/NNP then/RB I/PRP very/RB much/JJ recommend/NN this/DT place/NN ./.
However/RB if/IN you/PRP HAVE/VBP been/VBN to/TO Japan/NNP ,/, chances/NNS are/VBP that/IN you/PRP know/VBP better/JJR and/CC probably/RB just/RB come/VB her/PRP because/IN the/DT selection/NN in/IN Canada/NN is/VBZ so/RB slim/JJ ./.
Having/NNP said/VBD that/IN ,/, I/PRP will/MD keep/VB an/DT eye/NN for/IN other/JJ Ramen/NNS places/NNS to/TO expand/VB my/PRP$ palette/NN ./.
However/RB next/JJ time/NN I/PRP go/VBP back/RB ,/, I/PRP will/MD have/VB check/NN out/IN the/DT King/NNP Ramen/NNP ./.
I/PRP really/RB have/VBP never/RB paid/VBN so/RB much/RB for/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN noodles/NNS !/VBP !/.

Some/DT noodles/NNS ,/, some/DT ground/NN pork/NN ,/, some/DT extremely/JJ salty/NN broth/NN .../: .../:
It/PRP was/VBD suppose/JJ to/TO be/VB spicy/JJ but/CC was/VBD far/RB from/IN it/PRP ./.

We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB try/VB the/DT ramen/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP had/VBD the/DT Gyoza/NNP and/CC Takoyaki/NNP ./.
The/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD fine/RB ,/, but/CC not/RB surprisingly/RB delicious/JJ ./.
Maybe/NNP we/VBD expected/VBN too/RB much/RB ./.
People/NNS who/WP know/-NONE- Toronto/NNP well/NNP said/VBD they/PRP wo/MD n't/RB suggest/VB this/DT restaurant/NN as/IN a/DT good/JJ place/NN for/IN Ramen/NNP ./.

The/DT cheaper/NN ramen/NNS are/VBP still/RB filling/VBG though/IN even/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP pretty/RB hungry/JJ ./.
Good/NNP taste/NN and/CC perfectly/RB chewy/JJ noodles/NNS ./.
Decent/NNP ramen/NN although/NN can/MD not/RB compare/VB to/TO Sansotei/NNP ./.
Its/PRP$ cheaper/NN and/CC good/JJ for/IN lunch/NN ,/, noodles/NNS and/CC broth/NN are/VBP only/RB average/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD really/RB like/IN their/PRP$ onigiri/NN but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP really/RB small/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ opened/VBN by/IN Chinese/JJ people/NNS so/RB technically/RB it/PRP is/VBZ Chinese/JJ way/NN of/IN Ramen/NNP .../NNP so/RB ,/, having/VBG a/DT semi-cooked/JJ noodle/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT surprise/NN .../: I/PRP left/VBD half/NN of/IN the/DT bowl/NN there/RB .../: and/CC those/DT 2/NNS stars/NNS are/VBP for/IN the/DT dumpling/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ fully/RB cooked/VBN .../: .if/JJ I/PRP have/VBP to/TO give/VB its/PRP$ ramen/NN a/DT star/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD give/VB a/DT -2/JJ !/NN

It/PRP worths/VBZ 4.5/CD points/NNS ./.
I/PRP like/VBP their/PRP$ ramen/JJ variations/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD Tonkotsu/NNP ramen/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ impressive/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT good/JJ Japanese/JJ ramen/NNS in/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Toronto/NNP and/CC the/DT price/NN is/VBZ also/RB reasonable/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ recommended/VBN ,/, definitely/RB ./.

Green/NNP tea/NN latte/NN is/VBZ really/RB really/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC way/NN too/RB expensive/JJ for/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP !/.
The/DT Kenzo/NNP chain/NN in/IN general/NN is/VBZ ``/`` OK/NNP ''/'' ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB let/VB that/DT deter/NN you/PRP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB to/TO attach/VB any/DT negative/JJ connotations/NNS with/IN ``/`` OK/NNP ''/'' ,/, I/PRP really/RB really/RB just/RB mean/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ OK/NNP ./.
Considering/NNP ramen/VBD options/NNS in/IN Toronto/NNP in/IN general/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP like/VBP the/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN this/DT Kenzo/NNP a/DT little/RB more/JJR than/IN the/DT other/JJ ones/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ easier/JJR to/TO be/VB seen/VBN by/IN waiters/NNS than/IN the/DT one/CD on/IN Dundas/NNP and/CC it/PRP feels/VBZ less/JJR gaudy/NN than/IN the/DT one/CD on/IN Bloor/NNP ./.
Every/NNP time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN there/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ also/RB been/VBN quieter/JJ ,/, with/IN parties/NNS usually/RB from/IN 1~4/CD people/NNS ./.
This/DT might/MD be/VB why/VBN the/DT waitresses/NNS are/VBP sometimes/RB distracted/JJ talking/VBG to/TO each/DT other/JJ though/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB notice/VB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG expectantly/RB their/PRP$ way/NN with/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN done/NN right/RB away/RB ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP just/RB opt/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ more/RBR basic/JJ ramens/NNS ./.
My/NNP main/VBD complaint/NN about/IN Kenzo/NNP ramen/NN is/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBN too/RB much/JJ going/NN on/IN ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP picky/JJ about/IN your/PRP$ ramen/NN ,/, you/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB too/RB impressed/VBN by/IN Kenzo/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB too/RB bad/JJ ,/, especially/RB when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP really/RB craving/VBG some/DT ramen/NNS ./.
Kenzo/NNP Ramen/NNP is/VBZ beginner/NN level/NN ramen/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ what/WP ``/`` california/NN rolls/NNS ''/'' are/VBP to/TO sushi/NN ./.

The/DT noodles/NNS were/VBD chewy/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT pork/NN was/VBD marinated/VBN just/RB right/RB ./.
One/CD real/JJ downside/NN to/TO my/PRP$ noodles/NNS was/VBD that/IN although/IN they/PRP tasted/VBD amazing/VBG ,/, my/PRP$ throat/NN is/VBZ reeling/VBG from/IN the/DT sodium/NN and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP downed/VBN several/JJ glasses/NNS of/IN water/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN ./.

本來打算跟朋友到日式放題的餐廳享用晚餐，但是發現我們原本想去的那餐廳要等位，那我們只好到對面街的這家拉麵店吃晚餐。普通拉麵（鹽拉麵、醬油拉麵和麵豉拉麵）的價錢都比我預算中的便宜。由於我那晚非常餓，我點了鹽拉麵之後就加一元吧我的拉麵份量加大。雖然這家餐廳所選用的麵條是幼面，但是吃起來後感也不錯，但我自己本身是比較鍾情粗麵條的。鹽湯底不但不太鹹而且挺容易入口。吃完整碗拉麵之後我感到非常滿足和飽滿，整個身體也立馬暖了起來。如果大家是在找普通、飽肚的拉麵的話這家店是不錯的，但是如果大家是在找日本質素拉麵的話那我就會建議大家去其他的拉麵店享用。/NN

Environment/NNP is/VBZ also/RB average/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD not/RB say/VB I/PRP recommend/VBP or/CC not/RB ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP walk/VBP by/IN and/CC never/RB try/VB it/PRP before/IN ,/, then/RB you/PRP can/MD give/VB a/DT try/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT Netsu/NNP ramen/NN in/IN medium/NN and/CC boy/NN was/VBD it/PRP spicy/NN !/.
Next/NNP time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP getting/VBG mild/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD still/RB decent/JJ although/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT noodles/NNS ./.
Decent/NNP portion/NN size/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Tonkotsu/NNP Ramen/NNP as/IN well/RB and/CC I/PRP preferred/VBP that/IN ./.
The/DT broth/NN and/CC meat/NN were/VBD delicious/JJ in/IN that/DT one/CD ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD a/DT bit/NN small/JJ especially/NNS for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Ramen/NNP chain/NN store/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ if/IN you/PRP crave/VBP ramen/VBN but/CC do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO wait/NN ./.
I/PRP never/RB had/VBD to/TO wait/NN for/IN a/DT seat/NN at/IN Kenzo/NNP and/CC the/DT food/NN comes/VBZ pretty/RB quickly/RB (/VBN under/IN 10mins/CD every/DT time/NN )/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ fast/NN food/NN ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN authenticity/NN goes/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB that/IN authentic/JJ ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ some/DT chinese/NN food/NN elements/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT broth/NN is/VBZ ok/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ definitely/RB less/RBR flavorful/JJ than/IN Santouka/NNP or/CC Sansotei/NNP ,/, but/CC Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ also/RB much/JJ cheaper/NN ,/, gives/VBZ you/PRP more/JJR food/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP have/VBP no/DT wait/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB close/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ home/NN ,/, so/RB during/IN cold/NN winter/NN nights/VBZ it/PRP rakes/VBZ points/NNS for/IN convenience/NN ./.
The/DT servers/NNS are/VBP always/RB friendly/RB and/CC polite/RB and/CC service/NN is/VBZ prompt/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ clean/JJ ./.
The/DT noodles/NNS are/VBP the/DT wheat/JJ types/NNS and/CC are/VBP decent/JJ ,/, most/JJS times/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB overcooked/VBN ./.
Overall/IN a/DT good/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT decent/NN ,/, quick/JJ and/CC cheap/NN meal/NN ,/, but/CC do/VBP not/RB expect/VB mind/JJ blowingly/JJ great/JJ ramen/NN here/RB ./.
With/IN a/DT sudden/VBN ramen/NN craving/NN that/WDT fell/VBD upon/IN me/PRP ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO check/NN out/IN where/WRB the/DT closest/JJS ramen/NN joint/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ work/NN was/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ handy/NN dandy/NN Yelp/NNP app/NN ./.

You/PRP may/MD not/RB notice/VB Kenzo/NNP if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB looking/VBG for/IN it/PRP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ easy/JJ for/IN smaller/JJR spots/NNS to/TO get/VB lost/NN in/IN the/DT hustle/NNP &/CC bustle/NN of/IN Yonge/NNP St/NNP ,/, I/PRP find/VBP !/.

My/NNP waitress/NN was/VBD super/NN sweet/NN ,/, attentive/JJ ,/, and/CC friendly/RB ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ rare/JJ to/TO see/VB in/IN a/DT ramen/NN place/NN which/WDT focuses/NNS typically/RB on/IN pork/NN ,/, chicken/NN and/CC beef/NN broths/NNS ./.

My/NNP waitresses/NNS were/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC very/RB attentive/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD not/RB like/IN the/DT actual/JJ restaurant/NN itself/PRP .../: ..it/JJ felt/NN too/RB small/JJ and/CC too/RB cluttered/VBD and/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB the/DT open/JJ kitchen/NN concept/NN .../: .I/NNP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB to/TO see/VB my/JJ food/NN being/VBG prepared/NN as/IN it/PRP kind/-NONE- of/IN grosses/NNS me/VBG out/RP ./.

There/EX was/VBD a/DT time/NN where/WRB I/PRP absolutely/RB loved/VBD Kenzo/NNP as/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ ramen/NN choice/NN in/IN downtown/NN .../: ../NN Now/RB that/IN kinton/NN and/CC sansotei/NN and/CC others/NNS will/MD be/VB in/IN town/NN ,/, the/DT bar/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ higher/NN and/CC .../: .meh/JJ ,/, Kenzo/NNP 's/POS alright/NN ./.

Keep/NNP in/IN mind/JJ I/PRP am/VBP a/DT lightweight/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO spicy/JJ food/NN right/NN now/RB ./.
They/PRP have/VBP about/IN 20/CD or/CC so/RB different/JJ dishes/NNS ,/, mostly/RB in/IN the/DT ramen/NN soup/NN variety/NN ./.
Either/RB spicy/JJ or/CC non/JJ ,/, also/RB vegi/NN is/VBZ available/JJ for/IN most/JJS ./.

Ramen/NNP for/IN less/JJR than/IN $/$ 10/CD ?/.
This/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB the/DT option/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP picked/VBD the/DT Miso/NNP ramen/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ meh/NN ./.
The/DT broth/NN is/VBZ fine/NN ,/, the/DT noodles/NNS are/VBP fine/NN ,/, the/DT meat/NN was/VBD fine/NN ./.

Overall/IN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP will/MD ever/VB go/VB back/RB there/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS ramen/NNS in/IN the/DT city/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP serve/VBP Takoyaki/NNP to/TO boot/NN !/.
I/PRP was/VBD so/RB happy/JJ to/TO discover/NN there/EX was/VBD a/DT location/NN in/IN my/PRP$ neighbourhood/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT one/CD near/NN my/NN work/NN ./.
This/DT Kenzo/NNP is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ small/JJ and/CC crowded/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT ramen/NN is/VBZ just/RB as/RB tasty/JJ as/IN at/IN the/DT Bloor/NNP location/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP Tonkotsu/NNP Miso/NNP Ramen/NNP and/CC the/DT king/NN of/IN the/DT kings/NNS ramen/NNS ,/, the/DT soup/NN of/IN Tonkotsu/NNP is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN the/DT king/NN of/IN kings/NNS ,/, but/CC king/NN of/IN kings/NNS is/VBZ like/IN a/DT value/NN pack/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP everything/NN in/IN it/PRP and/CC the/DT quantity/NN is/VBZ big/JJ ./.
Kenzo/NNP Ramen/NNP is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ as/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ Noodle/NNP House/NNP Chain/NNP ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Sapporo/NNP Miso/NNP Ramen/NNP at/IN $/$ 10.95/CD ./.
The/DT description/NN of/IN the/DT dish/JJ is/VBZ very/RB accurate/JJ ./.
The/DT dish/JJ consisted/NN of/IN very/RB rich/JJ miso/NN soup/NN base/NN with/IN mixed/VBN stir/NN fried/VBN veggies/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT choice/NN of/IN pork/NN or/CC chicken/NN slices/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT vegetarian/JJ option/NN ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP chicken/VBN and/CC was/VBD very/RB pleased/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD at/IN lunch/NN time/NN just/RB at/IN opening/CD ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB return/VB to/TO try/VB the/DT other/JJ ramen/NNS dishes/VBZ especially/RB in/IN the/DT winter/NN or/CC any/DT time/NN I/PRP need/VBP a/DT rich/NN hot/NN soup/NN to/TO warm/VB the/DT insides/NNS ./.
Well/NNP fair/NN price/NN for/IN ramen/NNS ./.
Very/NNP friendly/RB waitress/NN and/CC fast/NN service/NN !/.
Would/NNP recommend/NN this/DT to/TO friends/NNS !/.
Great/JJ food/NN and/CC service/NN .../: We/PRP ordered/VBP few/JJ sups/NNS and/CC octopus/VBZ appetizer/NN and/CC everything/NN was/VBD absolutely/RB amazing../JJ
I/PRP highly/VBP recommend/JJ this/DT place/NN
This/DT Kenzo/NNP Ramen/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB solo/JJ eater/NN 's/POS heaven/NN !/.
Not/RB only/RB it/PRP has/VBZ tons/NNS of/IN tables/NNS for/IN 2/NN which/WDT are/VBP perfect/JJ for/IN single/JJ ,/, there/EX were/VBD in/IN fact/NN 5/IN tables/NNS of/IN single/JJ while/IN I/PRP was/VBD eating/VBG there/RB ./.
Wait/NNP staffs/NNS are/VBP a/DT lot/NN friendlier/JJR than/IN the/DT other/JJ locations/NNS I/PRP been/VBN to/TO ,/, especially/RB the/DT Dundas/NNP location/NN ./.
My/NNP Netsu/NNP Ramen/NNP (/VBD $/$ 8.95/CD )/CD level/NN 3/NN spicy/NN also/RB a/DT lot/NN spicier/JJR than/IN the/DT one/CD I/PRP had/VBD in/IN other/JJ locations/NNS ?/. !/.
The/DT noodles/NNS were/VBD chewy/NN and/CC cooked/VBD al/JJ dente/NN .../: ..really/RB warmed/VBN me/PRP up/RB on/IN this/DT cold/NN winter/NN 's/POS night/NN !/.
Another/DT great/JJ Ramen/NNP location/NN if/IN I/PRP have/VBP a/DT Ramen/VBN Attack/NNP !/.
!/NN
Was/NNP n't/RB the/DT best/JJS ramen/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN Toronto/NNP -/NNP I/PRP like/IN Sansotei/NNP (/NNP on/IN Dundas/NNP )/NNP better/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT lot/NN more/RBR options/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP want/VBP a/DT variety/NN of/IN ramen/NNS ,/, come/RB here/RB ./.
I/PRP prefer/VBP Tonkotsu/NNP or/CC pork/VB bone/NN broth/NN based/VBN soup/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD Sansotei/NNP or/CC Santouka/NNP does/VBZ a/DT better/JJR job/NN with/IN the/DT soup/JJ base/NN ./.
The/DT noodles/NNS itself/PRP were/VBD good/JJ but/CC the/DT meat/NN was/VBD average/JJ --/: it/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR flavorful/JJ ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT must/MD get/VB items/NN here/RB is/VBZ the/DT fried/JJ gyozas/NNS ./.
They/PRP were/VBD much/RB larger/JJR than/IN expected/VBN and/CC were/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ ./.
Did/NNP n't/RB really/RB enjoy/VB the/DT octobus/NN balls/NNS ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD mediocre/JJ since/IN my/PRP$ gyozas/NNS and/CC octopus/NNS did/VBD n't/RB come/VB out/RP until/IN after/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN and/CC I/PRP finished/VBP our/JJ ramen/NNS ./.
Had/NNP we/VBD not/RB asked/VBD them/PRP about/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP would/MD have/VB forgotten/VBN about/IN them/PRP !/.
I/PRP freaking/VBP love/JJ Ramen/NNP ./.
Authentic/JJ Ramen/NNS ./.
But/CC since/IN I/PRP am/VBP no/RB longer/JJ flying/VBG to/TO Japan/NNP every/NNP weekend/NN ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT beggar/NN and/CC not/RB a/DT chooser/NN now/RB ,/, am/VBP I/PRP ?/.
And/CC what/WP are/VBP ramen/VBN beggars/NNS left/VBN with/IN ?/.
Kenzo/NNP ./.
This/DT new/JJ location/NN used/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT home/NN of/IN Bowl/NNP ,/, a/DT pan/JJ Asian/JJ restaurant/NN (/NN and/CC shall/NN I/PRP mention/NN I/PRP served/VBD there/RB for/IN a/DT while/NN ?/.
ha/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT new/JJ owners/NNS did/VBD not/RB change/VB much/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN layout/design/NN ./.
The/DT location/NN gets/VBZ +/NN points/NNS because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB much/RB more/JJR spacious/JJ than/IN the/DT Dundas/NNP location/NN ,/, but/CC -/JJ points/NNS because/IN it/PRP feels/VBZ a/DT little/RB less/RBR like/IN a/DT Ramen/NNP House/NNP and/CC even/RB less/JJR authentic/JJ (/NNS wow/NN did/VBD n't/RB know/VB that/DT was/VBD possible/JJ )/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ alright/NN ;/: the/DT menu/NN is/VBZ identical/JJ to/TO the/DT Dundas/NNP one/CD ./.
I/PRP could/MD go/VB on/IN and/CC on/IN about/IN how/WRB ramen/NNS in/IN Toronto/NNP is/VBZ just/RB not/RB good/JJ enough/NN and/CC too/RB expensive/JJ (/IN I/PRP am/VBP SUCH/NNP a/DT ramen/NN snob/NN ,/, even/RB bigger/JJR than/IN I/PRP am/VBP a/DT sushi/NN snob/NN )/NN .../: but/CC seriously/RB when/WRB my/JJ choices/NNS are/VBP as/RB slim/JJ as/IN Kenzo/NNP or/CC Ajisen/NNP ,/, I/PRP still/RB regularly/RB -/JJ albeit/NN half-assedly/JJ -/JJ satisfy/NN my/NN cravings/NNS at/IN Kenzo/NNP ./.
Now/RB I/PRP just/RB have/VBP a/DT location/NN that/WDT is/VBZ even/RB closer/NN to/TO my/PRP$ home/NN !/.
In/IN terms/NNS of/IN side/NN dishes/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP really/RB average/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB to/TO just/RB stick/VB to/TO the/DT noodles/NNS ,/, and/CC do/VBP n't/RB try/VB their/PRP$ ``/`` fancy/NN ''/'' green/NN tea/NN drinks/VBZ either/NN ./.
My/NNP personal/JJ favourites/NNS are/VBP always/RB Miso/NNP ,/, and/CC Tonkotsu/NNP ./.
But/CC guys/NNS ,/, you/PRP really/RB got/VBD ta/NN go/NN to/TO Japan/NNP ./.
