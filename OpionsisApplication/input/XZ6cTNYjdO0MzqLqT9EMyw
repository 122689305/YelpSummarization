both/DT times/NNS were/VBD Saturday/NNP mornings/NNS ./.
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT problem/NN at/IN all/DT with/IN the/DT food/NN but/CC it/PRP should/MD n't/RB take/VB 20-25/JJ minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB an/DT egg/NN sandwich/NN ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP they/PRP are/VBP busy/JJ but/CC I/PRP work/VBP 12/JJ hour/NN days/NNS during/IN the/DT week/NN and/CC every/DT minute/NN of/IN my/PRP$ weekends/NNS are/VBP important/JJ ./.
