So/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT sort/NN of/IN unusual/JJ Yelp/NNP review/NNP ,/, given/VBD that/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB actually/RB end/VB up/RP eating/VBG at/IN Nadia/NNP 's/POS ./.
Here/NNP 's/POS why/NN :/: 1/CD ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD pricey/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRP am/VBP a/DT person/NN who/WP can/MD be/VB willing/JJ to/TO spend/VB on/IN occasion/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN Madison/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/NN expensive/NN for/IN its/PRP$ location/NN and/CC food/NN ./.
2/CD ./.
The/DT main/JJ reason/NN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB eat/VB there/RB ./.
There/EX was/VBD nobody/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP NOBODY/NNP ./.
No/DT host/NN ,/, no/DT customers/NNS ,/, nobody/NN ./.
And/CC yes/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD open/JJ for/IN business/NN (/NNS according/VBG to/TO the/DT unlocked/JJ doors/NNS and/CC times/NNS posted/VBD )/RB ./.
3/LS ./.
The/DT kitchen/NN looked/VBD disgusting/NN and/CC the/DT fish/JJ tank/NN (/NN as/IN noted/JJ earlier/NN )/NN could/MD definitely/RB use/VB a/DT good/JJ bath/NN ./.
Ironic/NNP ,/, yeah/JJ ./.
We/PRP strayed/VBD off/RP to/TO find/VB some/DT other/JJ food/NN and/CC settled/VBD for/IN the/DT close-by/JJ Porta/NNP Bella/NNP ./.
I/PRP enjoy/VBP Nadia/NNP 's/POS but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/VB comment/NN on/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB been/VBN to/TO the/DT bar/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ drinks/NNS are/VBP on/IN the/DT expensive/JJ end/NN for/IN Madison/NN but/CC the/DT martinis/NNS are/VBP EXCELLENT/NNP ./.
The/DT bartender/NN knows/VBZ what/WP he/PRP 's/VBZ doing/VBG ./.
I/PRP usually/RB come/VBP here/RB for/IN a/DT drink/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ friend/NN and/CC share/NN a/DT creme/NN brulee/NN ./.
Their/NNP creme/NN brulee/NN is/VBZ also/RB delicious/JJ ,/, but/CC how/WRB crispy/JJ the/DT top/NN is/VBZ is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT hit/NN or/CC miss/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT atmosphere/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ cozy/JJ and/CC quiet/JJ and/CC the/DT waiters/NNS mostly/VBP leave/IN you/PRP alone/RB to/TO enjoy/VB your/PRP$ drink/NN and/CC dessert/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT super/NN enjoyable/JJ way/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT long/JJ conversation/NN with/IN a/DT friend/NN ./.
Best/NNP restaurant/VBD in/IN town/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP enjoy/VBP good/JJ food/NN ,/, good/JJ atmosphere/NN and/CC money/NN is/VBZ no/DT object/NN to/TO you/PRP ./.
Nadia/NNP 's/POS have/VBP a/DT relatively/RB large/JJ menu/NN compare/NN to/TO other/JJ first/JJ class/NN restaurant/NN in/IN town/NN (/NNS around/IN 10/CD appetizers/NNS and/CC 15/CD entrees/NNS )/RB and/CC all/DT of/IN them/PRP are/VBP done/VBN superbly/RB ./.
Since/IN it/PRP has/VBZ an/DT extensive/JJ menu/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD always/RB find/VB something/NN you/PRP like/IN depends/NNS on/IN your/PRP$ mood/NN ./.
Sometimes/NNP I/PRP like/IN red/VBN meat/NN ,/, sometimes/RB I/PRP like/IN seafood/NN and/CC sometimes/RB I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN having/NN game/NN and/CC Nadia/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ definitely/RB the/DT few/JJ places/NNS in/IN madison/NN that/IN can/MD satisfy/VB my/PRP$ everchanging/NN appetite/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN pretty/RB much/JJ all/DT items/NNS for/IN the/DT appetizers/NNS and/CC they/PRP all/VBP taste/JJ very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD personally/RB recommend/VB the/DT roasted/VBN chevre/NN and/CC the/DT frog/NN legs/NNS ./.
For/IN entree/NN the/DT seafood/NN crepe/NN is/VBZ a/DT long/JJ time/NN champion/NN for/IN Nadia/NNP 's/POS and/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN red/VBN meat/NN and/CC poultry/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB the/DT lamb/NN and/CC the/DT duck/NN ./.
Ahh/NNP .../: Nadias/NNP .../NNP where/WRB to/TO start/VB .../:
I/PRP 'd/VBP love/JJ to/TO write/NN that/IN I/PRP can/MD overlook/VB the/DT grimy/NN dining/VBG room/NN and/CC horrendous/JJ service/NN because/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT truth/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ decent/JJ if/IN pricey/NN but/CC not/RB nearly/RB good/JJ enough/NN to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN Nadia/NNP 's/POS many/JJ other/JJ shortcomings/NNS ./.
I/PRP know/VBP this/DT is/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ statement/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD the/DT worst/NN service/NN I/PRP 've/VBP EVER/NNP had/VBD in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN at/IN this/DT price/NN range/NN ./.

I/PRP 'll/VBP stop/JJ here/RB ./.
Nadias/NNP rests/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ laurels/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ State/NNP St/NNP location/NN ./.

2/CD stars/NNS only/RB because/IN I/PRP think/VBP there/RB is/VBZ potential/JJ in/IN some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ dishes/NNS ./.
This/DT has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN our/PRP$ favorite/JJ restaurant/NN for/IN celebrations/NNS but/CC we/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO rethink/NN that/IN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ now/RB the/DT 3rd/CD time/NN we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN either/VBN bad/JJ service/NN or/CC less-than-excellent/JJ food/NN ./.
Nadias/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT cheap/NN restaurant/NN --/: the/DT two/CD of/IN us/PRP each/DT had/VBD one/CD cocktail/NN ,/, an/DT appetizer/NN and/CC main/JJ course/NN :/: $/$ 110/CD before/CD tip/NN ./.
For/IN that/DT price/NN I/PRP expect/VBP that/IN my/PRP$ food/NN will/MD be/VB top-notch/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN impeccable/JJ ./.
First/NNP our/NNP foie/NNP gras/VBZ went/CD to/TO another/DT table/JJ and/CC sat/JJ there/NNS for/IN quite/RB a/DT while/NN before/IN the/DT waiter/NN realized/VBD it/PRP had/VBD gone/VBN to/TO the/DT wrong/JJ table/JJ ./.
By/IN the/DT time/NN it/PRP got/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ it/PRP was/VBD stone-cold/JJ ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RP sending/VBG it/PRP back/RB to/TO get/VB heated/VBN back/RB up/IN ./.

Then/RB my/JJ salad/NN had/VBD the/DT wrong/JJ dressing/NN on/IN it/PRP --/: had/VBD to/TO send/NNS that/IN back/RB ./.
On/IN top/NN of/IN this/DT we/NN witnessed/VBD multiple/NN f***-ups/NNS so/RB bad/VBP that/IN I/PRP over/VBP heard/JJ the/DT owner/chef/NN griping/NN at/IN the/DT wait/NN staff/NN --/: and/CC later/JJ ,/, the/DT sous/JJ chef/NN had/VBD to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT wait/NN staff/NN area/garde/NN manger/NN kitchen/NN to/TO get/VB them/PRP to/TO pick/VB up/RP their/PRP$ dishes/NNS that/IN had/VBD been/VBN sitting/VBG on/IN the/DT line/NN ./.
Nadias/NNP used/VBD to/TO have/VB an/DT edge/NN but/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB dulled/VBN with/IN time/NN !/.
The/DT thing/NN about/RB Nadias/NNP is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP DOES/VBD remind/VBN me/NN of/IN a/DT restaurant/NN that/IN you/PRP 'd/MD find/VB in/IN the/DT Quartier/JJR Latin/NN or/CC in/IN St./NNP Germain/NNP du/NNP Pres/NNP ,/, where/WRB ambience/NN is/VBZ not/RB in/IN their/PRP$ top/JJ list/NN ,/, but/CC top/JJ notch/JJ food/NN is/VBZ ./.
And/CC that/IN 's/POS exactly/RB what/WP you/PRP 'll/MD get/VB here/RB ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ pathetic/JJ ./.
Sorry/NNP ,/, but/CC they/PRP can/MD afford/VB to/TO renovate/VB the/DT place/NN ./.
But/CC their/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ delish/JJ ,/, their/PRP$ staff/NN is/VBZ INCREDIBLY/NNP attentive/JJ ,/, and/CC for/IN some/DT stroke/NN of/IN luck/NN ,/, everytime/NN I/PRP go/VBP there/RB for/IN my/PRP$ birthday/NN ,/, the/DT owner/NN 's/POS best/JJS friend/NN also/RB is/VBZ there/RB in/IN the/DT next/JJ table/NN ,/, he/PRP orders/VBD a/DT full/JJ flourless/NN chocolate/NN cake/NN for/IN him/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ wife/NN ,/, not/RB eating/VBG it/PRP all/RB ,/, and/CC sees/VBZ me/PRP and/CC remembers/VBZ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ also/RB my/JJ birthday/NN ,/, and/CC orders/NNS me/VBP a/DT cake/NN and/CC champagne/NN too/RB ./.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD barely/RB ok/JJ .../: .the/JJ tables/NNS were/VBD too/RB close/JJ to/TO each/DT other/JJ and/CC we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN pretty/RB close/JJ to/TO the/DT kitchen/NN with/IN a/DT darn/JJ pillar/NN blocking/VBG most/NN of/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ./.
