It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT nursing/NN home/NN so/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB a/DT nursing/NN home/NN feel/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ more/JJR like/IN being/VBG in/IN a/DT hotel/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, the/DT employees/NNS were/VBD always/RB friendly/RB and/CC helpful/JJ ./.

The/DT good/JJ things/NN :/: The/DT rooms/facility/NN are/VBP extremely/JJ nice/NN and/CC clean/NN ./.
Patients/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO share/VB a/DT room/NN with/IN another/DT person/NN ./.

The/DT physical/JJ and/CC occupational/JJ therapy/NN was/VBD outstanding/JJ and/CC got/VBD my/RP mom/NN stronger/JJR and/CC stronger/JJR by/IN the/DT day/NN ./.

Doctors/NNS who/WP wo/MD n't/RB ok/VB over-the-counter/JJ aspirin/NN for/IN mom/NN 's/POS pain/NN even/RB when/WRB she/PRP only/RB needed/VBD it/PRP once/RB a/DT week/NN or/CC so/RB and/CC had/VBD no/DT reason/NN she/PRP should/MD not/RB take/VB it/PRP ./.

By/IN mistake/NN they/PRP sent/VBD my/PRP$ mom/NN 's/POS medical/JJ records/NNS with/IN another/DT patient/NN to/TO her/PRP off/RP campus/NNS doctor/NN 's/POS appointment/NN and/CC sent/VBD the/DT other/JJ patients/NNS medical/JJ records/NNS with/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN to/TO her/PRP doctor/NN 's/POS appointment/NN ./.
They/PRP scheduled/VBP my/RB mom/NN an/DT appointment/NN with/IN a/DT specialist/NN who/WP does/VBZ not/RB take/VB my/JJ mom/NN 's/POS insurance/NN ./.
The/DT drivers/NNS who/WP take/-NONE- patients/VBZ to/TO their/PRP$ doctor/NN appointments/NNS never/RB arrive/VBP in/IN time/NN unless/IN you/PRP have/VBP someone/VBN get/VB them/PRP on/IN the/DT phone/NN just/RB in/IN the/DT nick/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
They/PRP often/RB have/VBP a/DT slightly/RB wrong/JJ address/NN in/IN their/PRP$ phone/NN GPS/NNS and/CC take/VB the/DT patient/JJ to/TO the/DT wrong/JJ address/NN ./.
A/DT psych/JJ nurse/NN requests/NNS medications/NNS be/VB given/VBN which/WDT are/VBP contraindicated/VBN with/IN the/DT current/JJ medications/NNS mom/NN was/VBD taking/VBG ./.

That/DT means/VBZ she/PRP touched/VBD all/DT of/IN the/DT meds/NNS in/IN the/DT cup/NN with/IN her/PRP bare/JJ hand/NN ./.
That/DT is/VBZ a/DT big/JJ infection/NN control/NN no-no/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, an/DT OK/NNP place/NN if/IN you/PRP need/VBP daily/JJ physical/JJ therapy/NN and/CC occupational/JJ therapy/NN and/CC are/VBP not/RB in/IN good/JJ enough/JJ health/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT commute/NN each/DT day/NN ./.

My/NNP mother/NN was/VBD in/IN the/DT facility/NN for/IN a/DT broken/JJ hip/NN ./.
The/DT nursing/NN staff/NN is/VBZ HORRIFIC/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
They/PRP were/VBD refusing/VBG to/TO call/VB the/DT md/NN to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ mom/NN pain/NN meds/NNS her/PRP first/RB night/VBD there/RB ./.
Sofie/NNP the/DT rn/NN on/IN duty/NN argued/VBN with/IN me/PRP for/IN a/DT half/NN hour/NN as/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN lay/NN clenching/VBG the/DT bed/JJ sheets/NNS due/JJ to/TO excruciating/VBG pain/NN ./.

My/NNP mom/NN was/VBD nauseus/RB and/CC hadnt/VB eaten/JJ in/IN 10/CD days/NNS due/JJ to/TO this/DT problem/NN ./.

He/PRP went/VBD in/IN on/IN a/DT stretcher/NN with/IN a/DT feeding/VBG tube/NN and/CC left/NN without/IN needing/VBG the/DT tube/NN and/CC just/RB days/NNS away/RB from/IN no/DT longer/NN needing/VBG the/DT wheelchair/NN !/.
We/PRP were/VBD skeptical/JJ about/IN going/CD into/IN skilled/JJ nursing/NN but/CC I/PRP toured/VBD places/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN and/CC read/VB the/DT health/NN department/NN reports/NNS and/CC determined/VBD that/IN Sante/NNP of/IN Chandler/NNP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB the/DT best/JJS option/NN for/IN him/PRP ./.
Sante/NNP of/IN Chandler/NNP has/VBZ not/RB had/VBN any/DT bad/JJ marks/NNS (/VBP discrepancies/NNS )/IN in/IN years/NNS from/IN the/DT health/NN department/NN ,/, NOT/NNP ONE/NNP !/.
The/DT health/NN department/NN can/MD ding/VB them/PRP for/IN the/DT smallest/JJS thing/NN (/IN I/PRP read/VBP one/CD from/IN another/DT company/NN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD given/VBN a/DT bad/JJ mark/NN because/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT social/JJ event/NN with/IN ice/JJ cream/NN and/CC the/DT server/NN walked/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT ice/JJ cream/NN and/CC the/DT lid/NN was/VBD off/RP !/NNP )/.
so/RB this/DT is/VBZ quite/JJ an/DT accomplishment/NN ./.
We/PRP did/VBD not/RB run/VB into/IN one/CD person/NN at/IN Sante/NNP of/IN Chandler/NNP that/IN we/PRP felt/VBD should/MD n't/RB be/VB serving/VBG the/DT guests/NNS ./.
I/PRP saw/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN professional/JJ people/NNS working/VBG really/RB hard/JJ at/IN getting/NNP folks/VBZ back/RB on/IN their/PRP$ feet/NN ./.
My/NNP father/NN in-law/NN was/VBD treated/VBN with/IN respect/NN ,/, dignity/NN and/CC allowed/NN to/TO make/VB choices/NNS when/WRB he/PRP could/MD ./.
We/PRP did/VBD have/VB a/DT couple/NN of/IN little/JJ bumps/NNS while/IN there/EX but/CC I/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT case/NN manager/NN ,/, Pam/NNP ,/, and/CC she/PRP handled/VBD them/PRP with/IN a/DT smile/NN ./.
I/PRP felt/VBD comfortable/JJ leaving/NN my/NN loved/VBD one/CD with/IN them/PRP and/CC knew/VBD they/PRP would/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN him/PRP like/IN I/PRP would/MD ./.
We/PRP had/VBD several/JJ meals/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD really/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/JJ but/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB expecting/VBG that/IN !/.
I/PRP was/VBD happy/JJ that/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT set/VBN menu/NN (/NNS strawberry/JJ chicken/NN salad/NN is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ !/NN )/.
but/CC also/RB offered/VBD daily/JJ specials/NNS ./.
My/NNP father/NN in-law/NN started/VBD out/RP with/IN food/NN restrictions/NNS ,/, which/WDT the/DT restaurant/NN handled/VBD with/IN ease/NN ./.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO mention/NN also/RB that/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT day/NN when/WRB his/PRP$ feeding/NN tube/NN clogged/VBD ,/, only/RB twice/RB in/IN 7/CD weeks/NNS ,/, so/RB hats/VBZ off/RP to/TO Sante/NNP of/IN Chandler/NNP !/.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN it/PRP was/VBD simple/JJ for/IN them/PRP to/TO fix/NN but/CC the/DT second/JJ time/NN they/PRP thought/VBD maybe/NN we/PRP should/MD have/VB it/PRP replaced/RB ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT nurse/NN ,/, Jennifer/NNP ,/, asked/VBD if/IN she/PRP could/MD take/VB a/DT look/NN at/IN it/PRP and/CC was/VBD able/JJ to/TO unclog/JJ it/PRP herself/-NONE- and/CC thus/RB saving/VBG my/PRP$ father/NN in-law/NN from/IN ,/, what/WP could/MD have/VB been/VBN ,/, a/DT painful/JJ procedure/NN !/.
We/PRP thought/VBD that/IN was/VBD just/RB amazing/VBG !/.
She/PRP was/VBD just/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT caring/NN and/CC dedicated/VBD nurses/NNS at/IN Sante/NNP of/IN Chandler/NNP ./.
There/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ people/NNS there/VBP that/IN are/VBP fantastic/JJ and/CC we/PRP really/RB do/VBP miss/JJ them/PRP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD there/RB for/IN 7/NN weeks/NNS so/IN we/PRP formed/VBP bonds/NNS ./.
I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT place/NN for/IN a/DT loved/VBN one/CD and/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP on/IN here/RB you/PRP are/VBP ,/, call/IN them/PRP ,/, go/VBP on/IN a/DT tour/NN and/CC look/NN at/IN the/DT health/NN department/NN reports/NNS ./.
They/PRP are/VBP only/RB human/JJ so/RB ,/, if/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN ,/, talk/NN to/TO them/PRP and/CC let/VB them/PRP know/VB what/WP you/PRP would/MD like/VB for/IN your/PRP$ family/NN member/NN and/CC then/RB just/RB stand/VB back/NNS and/CC watch/VB it/PRP happen/VB ./.
