They/PRP are/VBP those/DT that/IN you/PRP expect/VBP when/WRB you/PRP order/VBP souvlaki/RB ./.
The/DT downside/NN was/VBD the/DT washrooms/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB come/VBN here/RB for/IN the/DT breakfast/NN before/RB ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ friends/NNS have/VBP ./.
Seems/NNP pretty/VBD standard/JJ (/NN but/CC good/JJ )/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP food/NN wise/NN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB consistent/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB amazing/VBG ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ good/JJ enough/NN to/TO fill/VB your/PRP$ belly/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN here/RB are/VBP laid/JJ back/NNS and/CC friendly/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ normally/RB pretty/JJ busy/NN when/WRB I/PRP visit/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB ever/RB had/VBN any/DT issues/NNS with/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
Going/VBG to/TO give/VB it/PRP three/CD stars/NNS for/IN now/RB as/IN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN any/DT problems/NNS and/CC generally/RB had/VBD a/DT good/JJ time/NN while/IN here/RB ./.
Not/RB bad/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN your/PRP$ typical/JJ breakfast/NN food/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN they/PRP precook/VBP your/JJ bacon/NN ,/, sausage/NN ,/, home/NN fries/NNS and/CC pancakes/NNS (/RB well/RB the/DT things/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ordered/VBN )/NN and/CC simply/RB cook/VB the/DT eggs/NNS when/WRB ordered/NNS ./.
Our/NNP food/NN came/VBD out/RP really/RB quickly/RB (/VBN 5/NN minutes/NNS after/IN ordering/VBG )/NNS ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB really/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN that/DT as/IN most/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ breakfast/NN places/NNS will/MD cook/VB to/TO order/NN -/NN even/RB the/DT bacon/NN and/CC sausages/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ more/JJR fresh/JJ that/IN way/NN !/.
Their/NNP coffee/NN however/NN has/VBZ no/DT taste/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT cook/NN to/TO order/NN place/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT one/CD ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT relatively/RB fast/JJ ,/, and/CC cheapish/JJ breakfast/NN place/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN it/PRP !/.
I/PRP would/MD probably/RB not/RB find/VB myself/JJ here/RB as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ relatively/RB far/RB for/IN me/PRP to/TO get/VB to/TO and/CC I/PRP could/MD probably/RB find/VB at/IN least/JJS 5/CD breakfast/NN restaurants/NNS before/IN getting/VBG there/RB !/.
If/IN I/PRP was/VBD around/IN the/DT corner/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD probably/RB come/VB here/RB more/RBR often/RB for/IN their/PRP$ relatively/JJ cheap/NN prices/NNS ./.

Also/RB ,/, as/IN a/DT ketchup/NN user/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD really/RB hard/JJ getting/IN it/PRP out/IN of/IN the/DT bottle/NN !/NN !/.
!/NN
I/PRP like/VBP that/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ open/JJ 24/7/CD ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB convenient/JJ when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP out/RP late/JJ at/IN night/NN (/NNS like/IN 3am/CD )/NNS and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ nothing/NN else/RB open/JJ ./.
Markham/NNP Station/NNP offers/VBZ decently/RB sized/VBN portions/NNS of/IN food/NN ,/, no/DT complaints/NNS there/RB ./.
Pricing/NNP of/IN the/DT menu/NN can/MD be/VB kinda/NN on/IN the/DT expensive/JJ side/NN ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, considering/VBG the/DT value/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN 's/POS quality/NN and/CC taste/NN falls/NNS short/JJ of/IN impressive/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB really/RB average/JJ to/TO me/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP early/RB bird/JJ specials/NNS though/IN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ always/RB a/DT plus/NN !/.

Upon/NNP being/NNP seated/VBD ,/, the/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP did/VBD was/VBD order/VB a/DT hot/NN chocolate/NN to/TO warm/NN me/PRP up/RB ,/, as/IN it/PRP was/VBD -20/CD degrees/NNS outside/RB ./.
Waited/NNP for/IN 25/NNP minutes/NNS ,/, before/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO remind/VB the/DT waitress/NN again/RB .../: .no/NN biggie/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD pretty/RB standard/JJ diner/NN fare/NN ./.
Ordered/IN the/DT club/NN sandwich/NN ,/, which/WDT came/VBD with/IN a/DT cup/NN of/IN mayo/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN (/VBD nice/JJ touch/NN )/NN ./.
Reasonably/RB tasty/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN by/IN any/DT stretch/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD notice/JJ they/PRP serve/VBP pretty/RB big/JJ portions/NNS for/IN pretty/RB much/JJ any/DT dish/JJ .../NN .my/NN friends/VBZ seemed/JJ quite/JJ content/NN with/IN whatever/JJR they/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
Overall/IN good/JJ experience/NN ,/, and/CC would/MD recommend/VB to/TO anyone/NN looking/NNS for/IN some/DT late-night/JJ grub/NN ./.

Being/NNP in/IN a/DT rush/JJ ,/, we/PRP popped/VBD in/IN here/RB to/TO get/VB some/DT quick/JJ grub/NN -/NN for/IN this/DT purpose/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN did/VBD the/DT trick/NN ./.

I/PRP liked/VBD how/WRB they/PRP allowed/VBP you/PRP to/TO order/NN from/IN a/DT decent/JJ selection/NN of/IN toppings/NNS ./.
Since/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB expecting/VBG a/DT gourmet/NN burger/NN for/IN take-out/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB too/RB many/JJ complaints/NNS here/RB -/JJ would/MD still/RB go/VB for/IN Harvey/NNP 's/POS those/DT at/IN that/DT quality/NN and/CC price-point/JJ ./.

I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT usual/JJ breakfast/NN meal/NN and/CC got/VBD something/NN I/PRP honestly/RB could/MD 've/VB made/VBN better/NN at/IN home/NN ./.

Overall/IN Markham/NNP Station/NNP gets/VBZ a/DT 2/5/CD
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT Scarborough-equivalent/JJ establishment/NN to/TO Smoke/NNP 's/POS Poutinerie/Burrito/NNP Boyz/NNP when/WRB you/PRP want/VBP something/NN late-night/NN ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN around/IN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ cheap/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP come/VBP late/JJ at/IN night/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD get/VB the/DT occasional/JJ ruckus/NN from/IN the/DT drunks/NNS but/CC overall/JJ not/RB a/DT bad/JJ place/NN to/TO grab/VB a/DT bite/NN when/WRB you/PRP should/MD be/VB sleeping/VBG ./.

Seems/NNP really/VBD petty/NN to/TO me/PRP to/TO charge/VB me/PRP for/IN something/NN different/JJ than/IN I/PRP asked/VBD to/TO get/VB an/DT extra/NN $/$ 1.50/CD on/IN the/DT bill/NN ./.
Is/NNS that/IN wrong/JJ of/IN me/PRP to/TO assume/VB you/PRP can/MD just/RB swap/VB out/RP cheeses/NNS or/CC am/VB I/PRP being/VBG petty/NN ?/.
3/NN stars/NNS just/RB because/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Why/WRB do/JJ people/NNS like/IN this/DT place/NN ?/.
The/DT service/NN sucks/VBZ and/CC the/DT food/NN tastes/NNS like/IN cardboard/NN ./.
The/DT price/NN is/VBZ cheap/NN ,/, but/CC why/WRB settle/NN for/IN such/JJ bad/JJ food/NN just/RB for/IN the/DT price/NN ?/.
You/PRP 're/VBP better/JJR off/IN going/VBG to/TO any/DT fast/NN food/NN joint/NN in/IN town/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT fruit/NN bowl/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT fruit/NN was/VBD old/JJ and/CC brown/JJ coloured/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT Spanish/JJ omelette/NN and/CC it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN something/NN a/DT 10/CD year/NN old/JJ attempted/VBN to/TO make/VB at/IN home/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN his/PRP$ //NN her/PRP life/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT orange/JJ juice/NN and/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN the/DT cheapest/NN brand/NN of/IN OJ/NNP available/NNP ./.
If/IN they/PRP even/RB used/VBP Tropicana/NNP or/CC Simply/NNP Orange/NNP ,/, it/PRP would/MD taste/VB a/DT lot/NN better/RBR than/IN what/WP they/PRP served/VBD us/PRP ./.
Mcdonald/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ also/RB 24/7/CD and/CC any/DT item/NN there/RB tastes/VBZ better/JJR than/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Let/NNP 's/POS not/RB use/VB the/DT excuse/NN of/IN price/NN here/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN all/DT over/IN North/NNP America/NNP and/CC Europe/NNP ,/, any/DT ``/`` cheap/NN ''/'' breakfast/NN place/NN I/PRP 've/VBP experienced/VBN in/IN the/DT past/JJ absolutely/RB destroys/VBZ this/DT place/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN I/PRP checked/VBD this/DT place/NN out/IN was/VBD because/IN it/PRP ;/: s/NNS open/JJ 24/7/CD and/CC nothing/NN else/NN was/VBD open/JJ ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ generally/RB poor/JJ reviews/NNS and/CC I/PRP can/MD honestly/RB say/VB that/DT 's/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB accurate/JJ sum/NN up/IN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP from/IN the/DT all/DT day/NN breakfast/NN menu/NN ,/, (/NNP 50z/CD Chicken/NNP breast/NN with/IN 3/JJ eggs/NNS ,/, hash/JJ brown/NN ,/, choice/NN of/IN sides/NNS )/JJ Which/NNP was/VBD $/$ 11/CD ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD surprisingly/RB decent/JJ ,/, not/RB too/RB dry/JJ ./.
The/DT eggs/NNS were/VBD good/JJ (/NN how/WRB can/MD you/VB mess/NN eggs/VBZ up/RP )/CD ,/, hash/JJ brown/NN were/VBD terrible/JJ ,/, It/PRP was/VBD stale/JJ and/CC not/RB crispy/JJ ,/, and/CC not/RB very/RB hot/JJ either/NN ./.
Most/JJS likely/JJ frozen/NN ./.
Toast/NNP was/VBD decent/JJ ./.
For/IN $/$ 11/CD I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP 're/VBP getting/VBG ripped/VBN off/RP ,/, If/IN you/PRP calculate/VBP the/DT food/NN cost/NN it/PRP was/VBD probably/RB $/$ 2/CD max/NN ./.
They/PRP try/VBP to/TO fill/VB the/DT plate/NN with/IN lots/NNS of/IN hash/JJ browns/NNS and/CC toast/NN ./.
Generally/RB the/DT menu/NN was/VBD expensive/JJ for/IN seemingly/RB how/WRB little/JJ you/PRP get/VB ./.
If/IN It/PRP 's/VBZ late/JJ and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT only/RB place/VBN possible/JJ for/IN you/PRP ,/, then/RB go/VB ,/, if/IN not/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP many/JJ other/JJ great/JJ 24/7/CD places/NNS ./.
Today/NN was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ visit/NN after/IN the/DT renovations/NNS and/CC loved/VBN it/PRP !/.
Only/RB complaint/VBD about/IN this/DT place/NN would/MD be/VB that/IN once/RB we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN ,/, we/PRP seen/VBP a/DT waiter/NN and/CC we/PRP said/VBD excuse/JJ me/NNS to/TO get/VB a/DT seat/NN and/CC he/PRP called/VBD over/IN another/DT waitress/NN to/TO give/VB us/PRP a/DT seat/NN ?/.
He/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ rude/NN about/IN it/PRP ./.
Other/JJ than/IN that/DT ,/, a/DT Chinese/JJ woman/NN was/VBD our/JJ waitress/NN and/CC she/PRP was/VBD so/RB kind/JJ !/.
Checked/NNP up/RB on/IN how/WRB we/PRP were/VBD doing/VBG a/DT couple/NN of/IN times/NNS and/CC provided/NNS us/VBP the/DT right/NN condiments../NN
Did/NNP n't/RB even/RB need/VB to/TO ask/VB for/IN anything/NN !/.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG !/NN !/.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB often/RB before/IN the/DT renovation/NN and/CC for/IN some/DT reason/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT prices/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD whatever/NN ./.
Today/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
I/PRP got/VBD two/CD eggs/NNS ,/, with/IN sausage/NN ,/, home/NNP fries/NNP &/CC white/JJ toast/NN ./.
Craving/NNP was/VBD def/JJ satisfied/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO Markham/NNP Station/NNP a/DT handful/NN of/IN times/NNS and/CC I/PRP never/RB had/VBD high/JJ expectations/NNS but/CC my/PRP$ last/JJ experience/NN was/VBD absolutely/RB horrible/JJ ./.
We/PRP went/VBD during/IN very/RB late/JJ hours/NNS and/CC there/NNS were/VBD very/RB few/JJ customers/NNS ./.
The/DT staff/NN were/VBD too/RB lazy/JJ to/TO greet/NN us/NNS at/IN the/DT door/NN and/CC we/PRP sat/VBP at/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT tables/NNS they/PRP pointed/VBD us/PRP to/TO ./.
It/PRP took/VBD way/NN too/RB long/RB for/IN the/DT server/NN to/TO come/VB by/IN to/TO take/VB our/NN orders/NNS (/VBP approximately/RB 15/CD minutes/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN she/PRP only/RB served/VBD a/DT few/JJ tables/NNS )/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT Steak/NNP Sandwich/NNP and/CC Cannelloni/NNP ./.
As/IN mentioned/VBN before/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB high/JJ expectations/NNS but/CC our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD very/RB sub-par/JJ ./.
The/DT steak/NN had/VBD a/DT very/RB pale/JJ brown/NN colour/NN to/TO it/PRP and/CC it/PRP did/VBD not/RB looked/VBN like/IN it/PRP was/VBD grilled/VBN ./.
The/DT cannelloni/NN was/VBD very/RB cheesy/JJ but/CC also/RB lacked/VBD taste/NN ./.
The/DT worse/NN part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ experience/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT service/NN ./.
Our/NNP drinks/VBZ came/RB much/JJ after/IN our/PRP$ food/NN arrived/VBD and/CC our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD not/RB only/RB rude/VB to/TO us/PRP but/CC also/RB to/TO other/JJ customers/NNS ./.
As/IN mentioned/VBN before/NN ,/, they/PRP did/VBD not/RB seat/VB customers/NNS but/CC rather/RB point/NN to/TO tables/NNS ./.
One/CD couple/NN came/NN in/IN and/CC did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO sit/VB where/WRB the/DT server/NN pointed/VBD so/IN they/PRP moved/VBD to/TO another/DT table/JJ without/NN talking/VBG to/TO the/DT server/NN ./.
Under/IN the/DT server/NN 's/POS breath/NN ,/, I/PRP could/MD hear/VB her/PRP say/VB ``/`` ok/JJ sit/NN where/WRB ever/RB the/DT hell/NN you/PRP want/VBP ''/'' ./.
The/DT couple/NN probably/RB should/MD have/VB asked/VBN the/DT server/NN but/CC that/IN type/NN of/IN language/NN is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ to/TO paying/NN customers/NNS ./.
After/IN our/PRP$ terrible/JJ experience/NN ,/, I/PRP left/VBD no/DT tip/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD hear/VB the/DT server/NN saying/VBG we/PRP were/VBD cheap/NN ./.
Very/NNP unprofessional/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD never/RB go/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD give/VB this/DT place/NN less/JJR than/IN one/CD star/NN if/IN I/PRP could/MD ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD for/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS for/IN a/DT waiter/NN to/TO come/VB to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC when/WRB we/PRP called/VBP a/DT passing/NN waiter/NN she/PRP rudely/RB ignored/VBD us/PRP and/CC then/RB went/VBD on/IN to/TO say/VB how/WRB our/JJ waitress/NN was/VBD coming/VBG ./.
Again/NNP another/DT 20/NN minute/JJ wait/NN before/IN we/PRP called/VBP someone/NN over/IN to/TO find/VB someone/NN to/TO help/VB us/PRP ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD terrible/JJ and/CC I/PRP understand/VBP as/IN it/PRP was/VBD Sunday/NNP morning/NN that/IN they/PRP would/MD be/VB busy/JJ but/CC this/DT was/VBD ridiculous/JJ ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD not/RB especially/RB good/JJ and/CC service/NN was/VBD really/RB not/RB that/IN great/JJ ./.
Went/NNP here/RB on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP morning/NN for/IN brunch/NN and/CC service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN busy/NN ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/VBN the/DT food/NN was/VBD edible/JJ for/IN a/DT prison/NN inmate/NN ./.
Service/NN was/VBD just/RB as/IN good/JJ how/NN do/VBP places/NNS like/IN this/DT stay/NN open/NN ?/.
