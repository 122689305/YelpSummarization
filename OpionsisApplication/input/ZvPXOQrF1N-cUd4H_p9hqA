It/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT older/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN an/DT old/JJ strip/NN plaza/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD in/IN town/NN for/IN work/NN and/CC tried/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ that/IN I/PRP came/VBD back/RB two/CD days/NNS later/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT small/JJ Hot/NN 'N/NNS '/POS Spicy/NN pizza/NN and/CC tried/VBD a/DT few/JJ of/IN the/DT local/JJ micro/NN brews/NNS ./.
The/DT pizza/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN perfectly/RB ./.

The/DT waitresses/NNS were/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD fast/RB ./.
This/DT place/NN will/MD definitely/RB be/VB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ go/NN to/TO spots/NNS when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP in/IN town/NN for/IN work/NN ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ just/RB average/JJ and/CC not/RB really/RB an/DT authentic/JJ Italian/JJ eatery/NN ./.

The/DT appetizer/NN Bruschetta/NN was/VBD not/RB made/VBN right/RB as/IN Italian/JJ style/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT entree/NN Veal/NNP Parmesan/NNP tasted/VBD awful/JJ ./.
Overall/IN I/PRP 'd/MD not/RB recommend/VB this/DT restaurant/NN to/TO someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ looking/VBG to/TO get/VB some/DT real/JJ Italian/JJ food/NN ./.
Best/NNP pizza/NN ever/RB !/.
We/PRP used/VBD to/TO order/VB it/PRP a/DT lot/NN but/CC started/VBD to/TO get/VB hooked/VBN on/IN other/JJ menu/NN items/NNS ./.

In/IN house/NN baked/VBD bread/JJ is/VBZ incredible/JJ !/.
Quality/NN of/IN food/NN and/CC service/NN overall/NN is/VBZ always/RB superb/NN ./.
You/PRP only/RB find/VBP that/DT kind/NN of/IN thing/NN in/IN family/NN owned/NN places/NNS ./.
So/IN last/JJ night/NN we/PRP were/VBD in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN quality/NN pizza/NN but/CC wanted/VBD to/TO stay/NNP home/NN and/CC watch/VBD a/DT movie/NN ./.
So/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP ahead/RB and/CC picked/VBD up/RP ./.
One/CD bite/JJ into/IN it/PRP and/CC I/PRP remembered/VBD why/IN we/PRP use/VBP to/TO have/VB it/PRP as/IN our/PRP$ pizza/NN of/IN choice/NN !/.
Quality/NN of/IN toppings/NNS ,/, sauce/NN and/CC the/DT dough/JJ .../NN ./.

Honestly/RB had/VBD to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD in/IN !/NNP
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB again/RB last/JJ night/NN for/IN dinner/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN were/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
True/NNP to/TO my/VB word/NN ,/, I/PRP ordering/VBP the/DT Chicken/NNP Marsala/NNP once/RB again/RB ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, three/CD of/IN us/PRP at/IN the/DT table/JJ did/NN ./.
This/DT time/NN I/PRP selected/VBD the/DT creamy/NN risotto/NN with/IN sun/JJ dried/JJ tomato/NN and/CC artichoke/NN ./.

My/NNP husband/VBD ordered/IN the/DT 8oz/CD Sirloin/NNP topped/VBD with/IN a/DT red/VBN wine/NN peppercorn/NN demi/NN glaze/NN ,/, also/RB accompanied/VBD by/IN the/DT risotto/NN (/VBD $/$ 19.95/CD )/CD ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, this/DT was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS flavourful/JJ steaks/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN in/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/NN and/CC the/DT little/JJ piece/NN he/PRP offered/VBD to/TO share/NN with/IN me/PRP simply/RB melted/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN ./.

As/IN always/RB ,/, the/DT wait/NN staff/NN are/VBP excellent/JJ here/RB and/CC believe/RB me/PRP ,/, they/PRP hustle/VBP !/.
I/PRP honestly/RB ca/VBP n't/RB get/VB over/IN how/WRB busy/JJ this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ (/RB well/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD ,/, considering/VBG how/WRB good/JJ the/DT food/NN it/PRP )/VBD but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ crazy/NN !/.
Make/NNP sure/VBD you/PRP book/VBP reservations/NNS well/RB enough/RB in/IN advance/NN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP planning/VBG on/IN going/NN ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC another/DT thing/NN I/PRP should/MD mention/VB which/WDT I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB before/IN .../: you/PRP can/MD order/VB pizza/NN for/IN take-away/NN ./.
A/DT little/JJ too/NN far/RB away/RB from/IN where/WRB I/PRP live/VBP to/TO benefit/VB me/PRP but/CC for/IN those/DT in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP this/DT would/MD be/VB brilliant/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ the/DT fettuccine/NN had/VBD to/TO much/JJ garlic/NN ,/, escargot/NN was/VBD nice/JJ flavor/NN but/CC could/MD off/RB been/VBN warmer/NN ./.

My/NNP boyfriend/VBD decided/CD to/TO take/VB me/PRP out/IN for/IN dinner/NN here/RB on/IN Valentines/NNP Day/NNP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT reservation/NN for/IN 7:30/CD and/CC I/PRP had/VBD no/DT idea/NN what/WP to/TO expect/VB given/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT holiday/NN where/WRB people/NNS go/VBP out/IN to/TO eat/VB all/PDT the/DT time/NN ,/, meaning/VBG it/PRP would/MD be/VB VERY/NNP busy/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB -/JJ I/PRP need/VBP to/TO try/VB the/DT other/JJ two/CD options/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN that/IN I/PRP could/MD n't/RB decide/VB on/IN :/: )/.
I/PRP love/VBP Brother/NNP 's/POS restaurant/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ spot/NN for/IN my/PRP$ family/NN on/IN special/JJ events/NNS like/IN birthdays/NNS and/CC anniversaries/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN ,/, simply/RB put/RB ,/, is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB ever/RB had/VBD a/DT few/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ pastas/NNS but/CC the/DT pizza/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS in/IN Whitby/NNP bar/NN none/NN ./.
Staff/NNP is/VBZ friendly/RB and/CC accommodating/NN and/CC the/DT owner/NN frequently/RB makes/VBZ his/PRP$ rounds/NNS throughout/VBP the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC speaks/VBZ with/IN everyone/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB let/VB the/DT scuzzy/NN parking/VBG lot/NN throw/NN you/PRP off/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT awesome/NN place/NN to/TO eat/VB !/.
Sat/NNP at/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ for/IN two/CD in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN for/IN close/JJ to/TO 20/CD minutes/NNS after/IN being/VBG seated/VBN by/IN the/DT owner/NN Chris/NNP ./.
Watched/NNP waitresses/VBZ pass/NN by/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ numerous/JJ times/NNS looking/VBG at/IN us/PRP with/IN our/PRP$ menus/NNS closed/VBD ready/NN to/TO order/NN ./.
After/IN watching/JJ people/NNS seated/VBN after/IN us/PRP with/IN bread/NN on/IN the/DT table/JJ and/CC glasses/NNS of/IN water/NN poured/VBD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD very/RB clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB going/VBG to/TO rate/NN in/IN their/PRP$ eyes/NNS ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD hungry/JJ and/CC tired/VBD of/IN being/VBG ignored/VBN so/IN we/PRP got/VBD up/RP and/CC left/NN ./.
Chris/NNP clearly/NNP could/MD n't/RB give/VB a/DT damn/NN because/IN he/PRP was/VBD too/RB busy/JJ chatting/VBG up/RP his/PRP$ regulars/NNS ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT waitresses/NNS were/VBD to/TO busy/NN chatting/NN with/IN the/DT other/JJ diners/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN if/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ any/DT good/JJ ./.
We/PRP never/VBP got/VBN a/DT chance/NN to/TO try/NN ./.
If/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ anything/NN like/IN the/DT service/NN tonight/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ going/VBG somewhere/RB else/RB ./.
I/PRP prefer/VBP going/VBG to/TO a/DT restaurant/NN that/WDT recognizes/VBZ that/DT service/NN is/VBZ an/DT equally/RB important/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT dining/JJ experience/NN ./.
Almost/RB as/RB important/JJ as/IN taking/VBG the/DT dinner/NN order/NN to/TO get/VB things/NNS started/NN ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RP going/VBG down/IN the/DT street/NN to/TO Hot/NNP Rocks/NNP ./.
Just/NNP as/IN busy/NN but/CC they/PRP managed/VBP to/TO seat/NN us/PRP have/VBP drinks/NNS on/IN the/DT table/JJ and/CC dinner/JJ served/VBN in/IN and/CC us/PRP out/RP the/DT door/NN in/IN one/CD hour/NN ./.
