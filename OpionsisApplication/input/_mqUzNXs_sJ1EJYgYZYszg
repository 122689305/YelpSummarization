A/DT really/NN good/JJ sandwich/NN place/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ location/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ unusual/NN but/CC very/RB convenient/JJ to/TO the/DT surrounding/NN airport/NN hotels/NNS ./.
The/DT turkey/NN ,/, avocado/NN bot/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD definitely/RB solid/JJ but/CC what/WP stood/VBD out/IN the/DT most/RBS for/IN me/PRP was/VBD the/DT friendly/JJ staff/NN and/CC the/DT iced/JJ coffee/NN they/PRP whipped/VBD up/RB ./.
Wish/NNP I/PRP had/VBD got/VBN their/PRP$ largest/JJS size/NN ./.
Highly/RB recommended/VBD !/.
Great/NNP place/VBD to/TO grab/NN lunch/NN ./.
The/DT location/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ hidden/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN an/DT office/NN building/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ shaded/VBN outside/JJ seating/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC my/JJ sandwich/NN tasted/VBN great/JJ ./.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT potato/NN salad/RB had/VBD too/RB much/RB dill/VB in/IN it/PRP ./.
What/WP a/DT find/NN ,/, right/RB behind/IN the/DT Radisson/NNP ,/, fresh/JJ cheap/NN and/CC delicious/JJ ./.

Give/NNP it/PRP a/DT try/NN ./.
I/PRP work/VBP in/IN a/DT office/NN building/NN right/RB around/IN the/DT corner/NN from/IN them/PRP ./.

Been/NNP there/EX for/IN breakfast/NN and/CC lunch/NN and/CC its/PRP$ meh/NN ./.
Only/RB open/JJ for/IN lunch/NN spot/NN ,/, a/DT nice/JJ little/JJ sandwich/NN shop/NN hidden/VBN behind/IN the/DT Radisson/NNP ./.

After/IN arriving/VBG at/IN PHX/NNP airport/NN we/PRP searched/VBD for/IN a/DT nearby/JJ lunch/NN option/NN and/CC this/DT was/VBD well/RB reviewed/VBN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ hidden/VBN in/IN a/DT larger/JJR building/NN with/IN very/RB little/JJ signage/NN ./.
Also/RB the/DT parking/NN lot/NN has/VBZ signs/VBN about/IN hotel/NN guests/NNS only/RB etc../VBP so/RB that/IN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ unnerving/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD closing/JJ soon/NN when/WRB we/PRP came/VBD in/IN ,/, but/CC we/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT BLT/NNP and/CC a/DT southwest/RB chicken/VBN panini/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD looking/VBG to/TO walk/NN from/IN my/PRP$ hotel/NN (/NN Aloft/NNP )/NNP and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB down/IN the/DT street/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN a/DT building/NN that/WDT blends/NNS in/IN with/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT Cobb/NNP salad/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC ready/NN in/IN about/IN 3/CD minutes/NNS ./.

Stopped/NNP in/IN for/IN breakfast/NN on/IN the/DT run/NN and/CC will/MD probably/RB come/VB back/RB for/IN lunch/NN ./.
The/DT guys/NNS are/VBP super/NN nice/RB .../: Coffee/NNP is/VBZ amazing/VBG !/.
Great/NNP little/NNP sandwich/JJ shop/NN tucked/VBD into/IN the/DT office/NN plaza/NN (/NN Follow/IN the/DT sandwich/JJ board/NN signs/NNS to/TO find/VB it/PRP )/-NONE- ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT lunch/NN roast/NN beef/NN special/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT red/VBD potato/NN salad/JJ seemed/NN to/TO be/VB missing/VBG something/NN for/IN my/PRP$ palate/NN ,/, but/CC over/IN all/DT it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ !/.
Meat/NNP was/VBD tender/RB ,/, taste/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC no/DT overpowering/NN sauces/NNS ./.
Its/PRP$ a/DT bit/JJ cramped/NN in/IN there/EX so/RB a/DT togo/NN order/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ idea/NN ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ close/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ other/JJ office/NN so/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ for/IN a/DT perfect/JJ stop/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD fast/VBN considering/VBG the/DT crowd/NN at/IN lunch/NN and/CC the/DT patrons/NNS and/CC employees/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO know/VB one/CD another/DT ./.
Its/PRP$ a/DT nice/JJ place/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, stop/NN by/IN and/CC have/VBP lunch/NN !/.
It/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO locate/NN but/CC just/RB look/VBP for/IN a/DT small/JJ sign/NN stating/NN there/EX are/VBP just/RB hiding/VBG in/IN the/DT back/NN !/.
(/NN :/: The/DT set/NN up/RB is/VBZ nice/JJ with/IN an/DT option/NN to/TO eat/VB indoors/outdoors/NNS although/IN I/PRP would/MD n't/RB recommend/VB bringing/JJ large/JJ parties/NNS ./.
Customer/NNP service/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO go/NNS with/IN the/DT BLT/NNP which/WDT ,/, they/PRP did/VBD not/RB shy/JJ away/RB with/IN the/DT bacon/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB visiting/VBG back/RB for/IN lunch/NN again/RB ./.
I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN this/DT place/NN has/VBZ gotten/VBN worse/NN over/IN time/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP feels/VBZ as/IN every/DT time/NN I/PRP try/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RB ,/, they/PRP fail/VBP to/TO meet/VB the/DT mark/NN somehow/NN ./.
I/PRP used/VBD to/TO frequent/JJ it/PRP when/WRB my/JJ work/NN first/JJ moved/VBD into/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, about/IN 4/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP today/NN was/VBD the/DT draw/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
They/PRP forgot/VBP to/TO include/VB dressing/NN with/IN my/PRP$ $/$ 9/CD salad/CD ./.
Also/RB ,/, without/IN the/DT dressing/NN ,/, the/DT chicken/NN has/VBZ a/DT strange/NN taste/NN ,/, almost/RB questionable/JJ ,/, which/WDT makes/-NONE- me/VBZ wonder/NN how/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ tasted/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN .../: at/IN least/JJS I/PRP got/VBD extra/JJ spinach/NN ./.
The/DT initial/JJ reason/NN I/PRP started/VBD going/VBG here/RB less/JJR often/NN was/VBD a/DT noticeable/JJ decrease/NN in/IN their/PRP$ salad/JJ sizes/NNS a/DT few/JJ years/NNS back/RB ,/, hence/NN I/PRP ask/VBP for/IN extra/JJ spinach/NN ./.
One/CD good/JJ thing/NN they/PRP have/VBP going/VBN for/IN themselves/PRP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT veggies/NNS they/PRP use/VBP in/IN their/PRP$ salads/NNS always/RB taste/VBP fresh/JJ ,/, for/IN that/IN reason/NN I/PRP gave/VBD them/PRP two/CD starts/NNS instead/RB of/IN one/CD ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP expect/VBP better/JJR for/IN the/DT price/NN they/PRP ask/VBP for/IN their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
Today/NN was/VBD my/VBN last/JJ visit/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD make/VB sure/JJ to/TO spread/VB the/DT word/NN at/IN work/NN ./.

My/NNP client/NNP has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN to/TO The/DT Lunch/NNP Lounge/NNP ,/, so/RB next/IN time/NN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN town/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT lunch/NN date/NN at/IN the/DT best/JJS undiscovered/JJ charming/VBG cafe/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP !/.

I/PRP visited/VBD this/DT restaurant/NN because/IN I/PRP got/VBD a/DT groupon/NN now/RB deal/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB like/IN I/PRP am/VBP asking/VBG for/IN much/JJ in/IN exchange/NN for/IN coming/VBG back/NNS and/CC supporting/VBG local/JJ businesses/NNS ./.

Nicely/RB toasted/VBD bread/JJ -/JJ all/NN in/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT decent/JJ lunch/NN !/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Egg-Cellent/JJ Burrito/NNP ./.
Its/PRP$ name/NN is/VBZ not/RB representative/JJ of/IN the/DT taste/NN ./.
It/PRP indeed/VBD did/VBD have/VB eggs/NNS ,/, but/CC not/RB the/DT greatest/NN tasting/VBG ./.
They/PRP pulled/VBD the/DT burrito/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT microwave/NN so/IN I/PRP assume/VBP that/DT 's/VBZ how/WRB they/PRP cook/VBP it/PRP ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP recommend/JJ checking/NN something/NN else/RB out/IN next/JJ time/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB cost/VBD $/$ 7.99+/CD tax/NN which/WDT is/VBZ too/RB expensive/JJ for/IN a/DT sandwich/JJ with/IN no/DT sides/NNS or/CC drinks/NNS ./.
