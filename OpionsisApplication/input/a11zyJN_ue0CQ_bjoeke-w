Come/NNP here/RB on/IN girls/NNS night/NN out/IN ./.
You/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB dissapointed/JJ ./.
Hunky/NNP dark/VBD Italian/JJ servers/NNS aside/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./.
I/PRP think/VBP this/DT might/MD be/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS italian/JJ food/NN in/IN the/DT Valley/NNP ./.
Service/NN was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ,/, food/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC a/DT little/JJ too/NN pricey/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD really/RB slow/JJ to/TO get/VB us/PRP food/NN and/CC check/NN ./.
Would/NNP not/RB go/VB back/RB ./.
Favorite/NNP Italian/NNP place/NN in/IN Scottsdale/NNP !/.
Would/NNP recommend/NN this/DT place/NN to/TO anyone/VB visiting/VBG Phoenix/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
This/DT service/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
They/PRP accommodated/VBD 15/CD of/IN my/NNP family/NN members/NNS and/CC we/PRP had/VBD the/DT best/JJS time/NN !/.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ consistently/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC let/NNP 's/POS face/NN it/PRP ladies/VBZ .../: if/IN you/PRP 've/VBP lived/VBN near/IN downtown/NN Scottsdale/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, you/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN about/IN the/DT hot/NN waitstaff/NN ./.
They/PRP even/RB had/VBD their/PRP$ own/JJ calendar/NN for/IN a/DT couple/JJ years/NNS !/.
Sadly/RB ,/, on/IN a/DT recent/JJ birthday/NN outing/VBG with/IN 4/CD other/JJ girls/NNS ,/, we/PRP were/VBD disappointed/VBN to/TO find/NNS that/IN the/DT hot/NN young/JJ boys/NNS were/VBD nowhere/RB in/IN sight/NN (/VBD no/DT offense/NN to/TO the/DT fine/NN waiters/NNS that/WDT do/NN work/RB there/RB )/RB ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT real/JJ reason/NN we/PRP chose/VBP Brioni/NNP 's/POS ,/, as/IN there/EX are/VBP other/JJ places/NNS to/TO get/VB good/JJ Italian/JJ food/NN if/IN that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP you/PRP 're/VBP after/IN ./.
Granted/NNP ,/, it/PRP may/MD be/VB that/IN the/DT boys/NNS had/VBD the/DT night/NN off/NN for/IN their/PRP$ other/JJ job/NN with/IN the/DT Chippendales/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP doubt/VBP it/PRP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD there/RB on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP seated/VBD us/PRP in/IN a/DT room/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB existed/VBN (/RP the/DT place/NN is/VBZ huge/JJ ,/, with/IN several/JJ rooms/NNS )/NN ,/, not/RB in/IN the/DT bar/NN area/NN where/WRB I/PRP 'd/VBP had/VBD good/JJ times/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, although/IN the/DT corner/NN where/WRB we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN smelled/JJ like/IN old/JJ wood/NN .../: ?/.
It/PRP seems/VBZ the/DT crowd/NN here/RB has/VBZ aged/VBN a/DT bit/NN as/IN well..not/NN that/IN there/EX 's/VBZ anything/NN wrong/NNS with/IN that/DT .../JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD more/JJR of/IN the/DT close/JJ to/TO retirement/NN set/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN hot/NN middle-agers/NNS like/IN us/PRP !/.
Bottom/NNP line/NN :/: still/RB great/JJ food/NN ,/, good/JJ place/NN to/TO take/VB visiting/NN family/NN around/IN the/DT holidays/NNS ,/, but/CC unfortunately/RB the/DT man/NN candy/NN is/VBZ gone/NN .../:
So/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD introduced/VBN to/TO Pasta/NNP Brioni/NNP about/IN two/CD years/NNS ago/IN by/IN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ best/JJS friends/NNS and/CC her/PRP$ sister/NN ./.

So/IN we/PRP went/VBD ,/, and/CC yes/VBZ the/DT server/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ looking/NN ./.
The/DT girls/NNS were/VBD pleased/VBN ./.
Aside/NN from/IN the/DT staff/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN has/VBZ been/VBN good/JJ every/NN time/NN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN there/RB ./.
I/PRP always/VBP get/VB the/DT four/CD cheese/NN rigatoni/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB welcome/JJ surprise/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT cake/NN was/VBD damn/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ !/.
HOWEVER/NNP .../: the/DT Service/NN was/VBD nonexistant/JJ !/.
We/PRP arrived/VBD at/IN 6:40PM/CD 1/19/2013/CD ,/, we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB our/VBN reservation/NN for/IN 6/NN ./.

We/PRP were/VBD handed/VBN menus/NN and/CC then/RB the/DT Waiter/NNP dissappeared/VBD ./.

They/PRP gave/VBD us/PRP all/PDT a/DT warm/NN roll/NN and/CC dissappeared/VBD again/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD no/DT butter/NN or/CC dipping/NN oil/NN for/IN the/DT bread/JJ ./.
One/CD os/NNS our/PRP$ friends/NNS got/VBD up/RP and/CC fetched/VBN oild/NN and/CC vinegar/NN from/IN the/DT waiter/NN station/NN ./.

He/PRP took/VBD another/DT drink/NN order/NN but/CC did/VBD n't/RB return/VB with/IN them/PRP ./.
Another/DT 3rd/CD waiter/NN came/VBD back/RP with/IN our/PRP$ drinks/NNS about/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS later/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD great/JJ but/CC then/RB it/PRP took/VBD another/DT 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ bill/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD them/PRP 2/CD hours/NNS and/CC 20/CD minutes/NNS to/TO serve/VB us/PRP from/IN start/NN to/TO finish/JJ ./.
The/DT whole/JJ time/NN ,/, I/PRP watched/VBD to/TO see/VB how/WRB busy/NN they/PRP really/RB were/VBD and/CC the/DT poor/JJ service/NN was/VBD due/JJ to/TO disorganization/NN ./.
Not/RB one/CD women/NNS works/JJ there/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/VBZ a/DT big/JJ part/NN of/IN their/PRP$ problem/NN ./.
Women/NNP would/MD have/VB been/VBN organized/VBN and/CC efficient/JJ ./.
These/DT guys/NNS were/VBD all/DT nice/JJ but/CC not/RB very/RB on/IN the/DT ball/NN and/CC generally/RB overwhelmed/VBN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP had/VBD to/TO do/VB with/IN being/VBG busy/NN (/IN there/NNS were/VBD empty/NN tables/NNS the/DT whole/JJ time/NN )/NN ,/, just/RB laziness/NN and/or/RB an/DT inability/NN to/TO be/VB organized/VBN and/CC efficient/JJ ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP giving/VBG 4/NN stars/NNS (/VBP instead/RB of/IN 5/CD )/NNS for/IN the/DT price/NN being/VBG a/DT bit/NN high/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT oddness/NN of/IN having/VBG sports/NNS play/NN while/IN eating/VBG $/$ 14/CD ravioli/NN ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN avoiding/VBG going/IN because/IN I/PRP tend/VBP to/TO trust/NN Yelpers/NNS but/CC I/PRP was/VBD honestly/RB pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN ./.

I/PRP tend/VBP to/TO stay/VB away/RB from/IN ``/`` suggestions/NNS ''/'' or/CC ``/`` specials/NNS ''/'' bu/IN the/DT waiter/NN did/VBD a/DT great/JJ job/NN of/IN going/VBG over/IN them/PRP and/CC not/RB being/VBG pushy/NN ./.
To/TO start/NNS with/IN the/DT negatives/NNS ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD say/VB that/IN my/PRP$ restaurant/NN experiences/VBZ (/JJ French/NNP ,/, Italian/JJ or/CC otherwise/JJ at/IN least/JJS in/IN Europe/NNP )/NNP begin/NNP with/IN a/DT few/JJ rolls/NNS of/IN bread/JJ in/IN a/DT basket/NN at/IN your/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC some/DT butter/NN (/NNS or/CC olive/JJ oil/NN )/NN ./.

All/DT that/IN capped/VBN with/IN a/DT bottle/NN of/IN Chianit/NNP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ start/NN to/TO our/PRP$ Saturday/NNP night/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP probably/RB recommend/VB it/PRP for/IN a/DT date/NN or/CC with/IN family/NN or/CC a/DT large/JJ group/NN but/CC definitely/RB not/RB for/IN parents/NNS with/IN young/JJ children/NNS as/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB necessarily/RB the/DT most/RBS casual/JJ place/NN to/TO dine/VB ./.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB written/VBN a/DT Yelp/NNP review/NN before/IN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT pasta/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD mediocre/JJ at/IN best/JJS ./.

I/PRP can/MD safely/RB say/VB that/IN I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB returning/VBG to/TO this/DT place/NN ./.

A+++++++/NNP
So/RB disappointing/JJ ./.
Have/NNP n't/RB gone/NN in/IN few/JJ years/NNS and/CC decided/VBD to/TO try/NNP ./.
Wedge/NNP had/VBD wilted/VBN lettuce/NN ,/, tasteless/JJ tomato/NN and/CC the/DT blue/JJ cheese/NN had/VBD zero/VBN flavor/NN ./.
Then/RB the/DT veal/NN Chop/NNP ./.
Served/JJ with/IN frozen/NN spinach/NN ,/, tasteless/JJ mushrooms/NNS drenched/VBD in/IN butter/NN and/CC the/DT chop/NN itself/NN was/VBD bland/JJ and/CC blah/JJ ./.
The/DT ciopini/NN was/VBD blah/JJ ./.
Overall/IN not/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
Too/NNP bad/NNP ,/, used/VBD to/TO be/VB great/JJ ./.
what/WP came/VBD first/RB ,/, no/DT business/NN or/CC crap/NN ingredients/NNS and/CC no/DT chef/NN ?/.
Surprised/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ still/RB in/IN business/NN ./.
Went/NNP with/IN a/DT groupon/NN -/NN would/MD never/RB have/VB though/IN of/IN going/VBG otherwise/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ I/PRP did/VBD though/IN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD spectacular/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD penne/JJ pasta/NN from/IN the/DT special/JJ menu/NN ,/, with/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN vodka/NN sauce/NN ,/, peas/NNS ,/, ham/NN ,/, cheese/NN -/NN it/PRP sounds/VBZ boring/VBG but/CC it/PRP was/VBD awesome/JJ ./.
My/NNP partner/NNP had/VBD veal/JJ marsala/NN -/NN again/RB awesome/JJ ./.
We/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB -/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ pricey/JJ but/CC worth/JJ it/PRP
Never/NNP again/RB ./.
We/PRP made/VBD reservations/NNS for/IN 5:45/CD on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN ,/, definitely/RB did/VBD not/RB need/VB a/DT reservation/NN though/NN ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD dead/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD told/VBG to/TO sit/VB wherever/JJR we/PRP wanted/RB ,/, we/PRP chose/VBP a/DT booth/NN in/IN the/DT lounge/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, pretty/RB typical/JJ for/IN a/DT small/JJ Italian/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD awkward/JJ but/CC I/PRP think/VBP the/DT server/NN was/VBD new/JJ ,/, he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB mess/VB anything/NN up/RB ,/, he/PRP just/RB did/VBD odd/JJ things/NNS ./.
Like/IN he/PRP took/VBD our/PRP$ order/NN and/CC had/VBD to/TO come/VB back/RB again/RB because/IN he/PRP forgot/RB what/WP my/NNP boyfriend/NN had/VBD ordered/VBN ./.
After/IN our/PRP$ meals/NNS were/VBD delivered/VBN (/-NONE- by/IN someone/NN else/RB )/JJ our/NN server/NN came/VBD by/IN and/CC said/VBD ``/`` once/RB your/VBN pasta/NN arrives/NNS ,/, do/VBP you/PRP want/VB cheese/NN ?/.
OH/NNP !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ already/RB here/RB !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP blind/JJ !/NN ``/`` ./.
We/PRP chose/VBP to/TO laugh/JJ about/IN the/DT slightly/NN bizarre/NN service/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP both/DT been/VBN the/DT new/JJ kid/NN before/IN too/RB ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT rolls/NNS that/WDT came/VBD before/IN dinner/NN but/CC the/DT oil/vinegar/NN bottles/NNS were/VBD both/DT leaky/NN so/RB made/VBD a/DT mess/NN of/IN our/PRP$ hands/NNS and/CC the/DT table/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT balsamic/JJ chicken/NN ,/, I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD that/IN this/DT restaurant/NN offers/VBZ an/DT under/IN 650/CD calorie/NN menu/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB starving/JJ and/CC not/RB really/RB in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN pasta/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ choice/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ flavor/NN and/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD what/WP I/PRP ate/VBP of/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB super/JJ hungry/NN and/CC had/VBD already/RB had/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN bread/JJ ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN had/VBD pesto/VBN chicken/VBN pasta/NN ,/, I/PRP noticed/VBD him/PRP doing/VBD something/NN strange/NN during/IN the/DT meal/NN ,/, he/PRP kept/VBD taking/VBG a/DT bite/NN of/IN his/PRP$ meal/NN and/CC then/RB pulling/VBG pieces/NNS of/IN chicken/NN out/IN of/IN his/PRP$ mouth/NN and/CC putting/VBG it/PRP on/IN the/DT bread/JJ plate/NN ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD him/PRP what/WP was/VBD wrong/JJ and/CC he/PRP said/VBD ``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN cartilage/NN or/CC something/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB .../: not/RB good/JJ ''/'' ./.
He/PRP did/VBD finish/VB the/DT dish/JJ though/NN (/NN except/NN for/IN the/DT ever/NN growing/VBG pile/NN of/IN chewed/VBN chicken/NN on/IN the/DT bread/JJ plate/NN )/NN ./.
We/PRP left/VBP and/CC agreed/VBD that/IN we/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT place/NN does/VBZ n't/RB even/RB deserve/VB the/DT 1-star/JJ ,/, midnight/JJ found/NN us/PRP both/DT on/IN the/DT bathroom/NN floor/NN ./.
Him/NNP ,/, projectile/JJ vomiting/VBG from/IN a/DT textbook/NN case/NN of/IN food/NN poisoning/NN and/CC me/PRP playing/RB nurse/VBP ./.

The/DT food/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN good/JJ ,/, leaving/JJ me/NN wanting/VBG more/JJR ./.
That/DT was/VBD until/IN lastnight/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN causing/VBG the/DT need/NN to/TO watch/VB their/PRP$ costs/NNS because/IN they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO be/VB cutting/VBG back/RB on/IN critical/JJ ingredients/NNS ./.
The/DT chicken/NN breast/NN in/IN the/DT parmesana/NN and/CC bianco/NN chicken/NN entrees/NNS were/VBD pounded/VBN to/TO a/DT paper/NN thin/JJ thickness/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, there/EX were/VBD very/RB few/JJ small/JJ ,/, diced/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN shrimp/NN in/IN the/DT penne/NN vodka/NN shrimp/NN entree/NN ./.

We/PRP arrived/VBD early/RB enough/RB to/TO get/VB the/DT early/JJ bird/NN special/NN ,/, which/WDT appeared/-NONE- to/TO be/VB a/DT better/JJR deal/NN than/IN the/DT yelp/NN eats/VBZ one/CD ./.
I/PRP wonder/VBP if/IN this/DT was/VBD truly/RB our/JJ best/NN choice/NN ./.
For/IN me/PRP when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO pasta/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP a/DT bit/NN picky/NN ./.
This/DT mainly/NN comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB really/RB heavy/JJ sauces/NNS and/CC I/PRP really/RB do/VBP not/RB like/IN tomatoes/NNS ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ Italian/JJ place/NN and/CC not/RB your/VB run/NN of/IN the/DT mill/NN to/TO get/VB me/PRP excited/VBD ./.
My/NNP first/JJ course/NN was/VBD a/DT Caesar/NN salad/NN ./.
Wait/NNP take/VBD that/IN back/RB ./.
That/DT was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB my/VBN first/JJ course/NN ./.
I/PRP believe/VBP I/PRP really/RB got/VBD romaine/NN lettuce/NN ,/, croutons/NNS and/CC dressing/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ./.
It/PRP definitely/RB was/VBD *not*/VBN Caesar/NN ./.
This/DT left/NN me/VBZ sad/JJ ./.
The/DT bread/JJ with/IN it/PRP though/IN was/VBD pretty/RB damn/JJ good/JJ although/IN I/PRP suggest/VBP bigger/JJ bottles/NNS of/IN balsamic/NN ./.
We/PRP ran/VBD out/RP fast/RB !/.
My/NNP main/NNP course/NN was/VBD chicken/VBN marsala/NN and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN penne/NN ./.
The/DT penne/NN came/VBD with/IN a/DT paste/NN (/IN note/NN I/PRP did/VBD not/RB say/VB sauce/JJ )/NNS and/CC seemed/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/NN and/CC bland/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN marsala/NN was/VBD actually/RB decent/JJ but/CC pretty/RB run/JJ of/IN the/DT mill/NN and/CC nothing/NN spectacular/NN ./.

Like/IN the/DT pasta/NN ,/, they/PRP seemed/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/NN and/CC lacking/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD flavorful/JJ ./.
Overall/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN was/VBD really/RB just/RB okay/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD also/RB nothing/JJ outstanding/JJ either/NNS ,/, including/VBG someone/NN having/NNS to/TO ask/VB for/IN water/NN on/IN several/JJ occasions/NNS ./.
Took/IN the/DT girlfriend/NN on/IN Valentine/NNP 's/POS Day/NNP after/IN making/VBG a/DT reservation/NN on/IN Open/NNP Table/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ night/NN so/IN it/PRP was/VBD comfortable/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT overhead/NN lights/NNS being/VBG so/RB bright/IN it/PRP took/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT ambiance/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD specials/NNS for/IN the/DT night/NN and/CC their/PRP$ normal/JJ menu/NN ./.
One/CD entree/NN was/VBD sold/VBN out/RP ,/, rigatoni/NN with/IN bolognese/NN which/WDT is/VBZ probably/RB what/WP I/PRP would/MD have/VB ordered/VBN so/RB I/PRP go/VBP spaghetti/JJ with/IN meatballs/NNS ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB by/IN any/DT means/NNS a/DT pasta/NN connoisseur/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT was/VBD the/DT best/JJS spaghetti/NN and/CC meatballs/NNS I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP from/IN Italy/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, pasta/NN must/MD to/TO be/VB cooked/VBN in/IN certain/JJ ways/NNS ./.
The/DT rigatoni/NN were/VBD overcooked/VBN and/CC the/DT cheese/NN was/VBD bitter/JJ and/CC just/RB not/RB good/JJ ./.

We/PRP had/VBD a/DT group/NN of/IN 14/NNP &/CC were/VBD treated/VBN like/IN the/DT queens/NNS that/IN we/PRP are/VBP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD n't/RB been/VBN to/TO Pasta/NNP Brioni/NNP in/IN quite/JJ some/DT time/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD organizing/VBG a/DT bachelorette/NN party/NN one/CD of/IN us/PRP suggested/VBD this/DT place/NN for/IN dinner/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT hot/NN waiters/NNS (/VBP yeah/JJ ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB gon/VBN na/NN be/VB shallow/JJ ,/, and/CC not/RB play/VB coy/NN about/IN that/DT )/NNP &/CC its/PRP$ proximity/NN to/TO Old/NNP Town/NNP ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP actually/RB offer/VBP set/VBN menu/NN deals/NNS for/IN large/JJ parties/NNS ,/, but/CC with/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN girls/NNS (/NNS who/WP may/MD or/CC may/MD not/RB by/IN picky/JJ eaters/NNS )/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB take/VB advantage/NN of/IN this/DT ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB any/DT of/IN the/DT set/NN menus/VBZ include/JJ alcohol/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT mushroom/NN risotto/NN &/CC it/PRP was/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
It/PRP was/VBD creamy/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB too/RB creamy/JJ ,/, and/CC they/PRP 're/VBP was/VBD just/RB the/DT right/NN amount/NN of/IN vegetables/NNS to/TO risotto/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB care/VB that/IN I/PRP was/VBD amongst/RB all/DT girls/NNS ,/, I/PRP happily/RB ate/VBP the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD fantastic/JJ as/RB well/RB !/.
I/PRP believe/VBP our/JJ waiter/NN 's/POS name/NN was/VBD John/NNP (/NNP I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB believe/VB I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB 100/CD %/NN remember/NN his/PRP$ name/NN )/NNP &/CC he/PRP definitely/RB played/VBD up/IN the/DT fact/NN this/DT was/VBD a/DT bachelorette/NN party/NN group/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB point/VB out/IN the/DT bachelorette/NN got/VBD a/DT special/JJ dessert/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN ;/: )/NNP I/NNP would/MD definitely/RB come/VB back/RB to/TO Pasta/NNP Brioni/NNP for/IN any/DT type/NN of/IN meal/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD especially/RB keep/VB them/PRP in/IN mind/NN again/NN for/IN a/DT large/JJ dinner/NN party/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP wanted/RB this/DT place/NN to/TO be/VB good/JJ ,/, especially/RB after/IN reading/NN all/PDT the/DT positive/JJ reviews/NNS on/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
But/CC sadly/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD just/RB mediocre/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG good/JJ crusty/NN italian/JJ bread/NN for/IN starters/NNS ./.
What/WP I/PRP got/VBD was/VBD a/DT hand/NN delivered/NN small/JJ roll/NN ,/, neither/DT crusty/NN or/CC warm/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN commented/VBD how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD mealy/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD ./.
My/NNP Pasta/NNP E/NNP Fagioli/NNP had/VBD a/DT slight/NN vinegar/NN taste/NN and/CC not/RB balsamic/JJ vinegar/NN ,/, white/JJ vinegar/NN ./.
Yuk/NNP ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ordered/VBD chicken/VBN parm/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN meatballs/NNS ./.
The/DT meatballs/NNS were/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ./.
The/DT chicken/NN parm/NN had/VBD a/DT good/JJ flavor/NN but/CC the/DT presentation/NN looked/VBD bad/JJ ./.
Sparsely/RB melted/VBN cheese/NN that/IN looked/JJ like/IN it/PRP had/VBD just/RB barely/RB melted/VBN in/IN a/DT microwave/NN and/CC not/RB the/DT lightly/RB browned/VBN cheese/NN evidencing/VBG time/NN spent/NNS in/IN a/DT hot/NN oven/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT four/CD cheese/NN rigitoni/NN which/WDT was/VBD actually/RB pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
After/IN the/DT bread/JJ ,/, the/DT soup/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT yukky/JJ looking/VBG chicken/NN parm/NN ,/, we/PRP chose/VBP not/RB to/TO spend/VB any/DT more/JJR $/$ $/$ on/IN desert/NN ./.
Service/NNP and/CC ambiance/NN was/VBD above/IN average/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD n't/RB quite/RB what/VB we/PRP were/VBD hoping/VBG for/IN ,/, not/RB for/IN the/DT money/NN anyway/NN ./.
Our/NNP search/NN goes/VBZ on/IN for/IN good/JJ Italian/NN in/IN the/DT Phoenix/NNP ,/, Scottsdale/NNP area/NNP ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, not/RB a/DT bad/JJ place/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN the/DT $/$ $/CD ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD get/VB a/DT bottle/NN of/IN Rao/NNP 's/POS sauce/NN ,/, some/DT meatballs/NNS from/IN Guidos/NNP ,/, and/CC save/VB the/DT grief/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP a/DT small/JJ patio/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB very/RB inviting/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ very/RB old/JJ and/CC somewhat/JJ run/NN down/IN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT only/RB reason/VBN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB give/VB five/CD stars/NNS ./.
Though/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ old/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ clean/JJ ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN looking/VBG for/IN a/DT good/JJ Italian/JJ place/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN for/IN some/DT time/NN ./.

The/DT bread/JJ served/JJ before/IN the/DT meal/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC warm/NN ./.
Much/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ liking/NN ./.
Before/NNP the/DT main/JJ meal/NN ,/, we/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT caesar/NN salad/NN ./.
The/DT salad/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC nothing/NN exceptional/JJ ./.
The/DT salad/NN was/VBD by/IN far/RB the/DT least/JJS favorite/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
The/DT pasta/NN and/CC pasta/NN sauce/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN a/DT very/RB basic/JJ dish/NN of/IN rigatoni/NN bolganese/NN ./.
The/DT dish/JJ was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC had/VBD lots/NNS of/IN food/NN ./.
After/IN filling/VBG up/RP on/IN bread/JJ ,/, salad/JJ and/CC our/PRP$ meal/NN ,/, we/PRP could/MD n't/RB go/VB for/IN dessert/NN ,/, but/CC split/JJ one/CD ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT chocolate/NN ice/NN cream/NN in/IN a/DT hard/JJ shell/NN ,/, with/IN hazlenut/NN with/IN whipped/JJ cream/NN ./.
The/DT dessert/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.

Nice/NNP atmosphere/RB in/IN the/DT dining/NN room/NN and/CC bar/NN area/NN ./.

The/DT waiter/NN was/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ needs/NN and/CC water/NN was/VBD refilled/VBN in/IN a/DT prompt/NN manner/NN ./.

They/PRP put/VBP together/RB a/DT few/JJ different/JJ dishes/NNS along/VBP with/IN a/DT salad/JJ that/IN satisfied/JJ all/DT our/NN cravings/NNS ./.
The/DT chicken/NN with/IN eggplant/JJ and/CC promiscuitto/NN (/NN sp/NN )/NN in/IN a/DT wine/NN sauce/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ ./.
We/PRP would/MD eat/VB there/RB again/RB the/DT next/JJ time/NN we/PRP 're/VBP in/IN Phx/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD our/PRP$ first/JJ time/NN dining/NN here/RB and/CC we/PRP picked/VBD it/PRP mostly/RB for/IN the/DT location/NN and/CC reviews/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC portions/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ./.
I/PRP am/VBP giving/VBG this/DT a/DT four/CD star/NN rather/RB than/IN five/CD only/RB because/IN towards/NNS the/DT end/NN of/IN our/PRP$ dinner/NN I/PRP was/VBD parched/VBN and/CC looking/VBG for/IN our/PRP$ waiter/NN for/IN water/NN refills/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT menu/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/RB on/IN the/DT expensive/JJ side/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ I/PRP will/MD ever/VB go/JJ back/RB ./.

I/PRP guess/VBP the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD expecting/VBG a/DT large/JJ party/NN so/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO work/NN before/IN the/DT party/NN arrived/VBD ./.
Our/NNP server/NN brought/VBD us/PRP menus/VBZ finally/RB after/IN he/PRP brought/VBD two/CD waters/NNS and/CC a/DT basket/NN of/IN bread/JJ and/CC we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN they/PRP only/RB served/VBN pizza/NN in/IN the/DT To/NN Go/NNP room/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT server/NN if/IN we/PRP should/MD take/VB our/NN waters/NNS over/IN and/CC he/PRP said/VBD ``/`` Nahhhhhh/NNP ''/'' so/IN I/PRP left/VBP them/PRP there/RB ,/, fully/RB expecting/VBG we/PRP would/MD be/VB offered/VBN water/NN in/IN the/DT separate/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ ./.
Needless/NNP to/TO say/VB I/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB for/IN plates/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ pizza/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO dine/VB in/IN but/CC found/VBD out/IN they/PRP were/VBD expecting/VBG a/DT large/JJ party/NN in/IN that/DT room/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN by/IN a/DT friendly/JJ server/NN and/CC given/VBN fresh/JJ bread/JJ (/NN made/VBD in/IN house/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT bread/NN was/VBD phenomenal/JJ and/CC soft/JJ ./.

I/PRP could/MD 've/VB kicked/VBN myself/NN for/IN not/RB coming/VBG here/RB sooner/JJR !/.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT gem/NN !/.
The/DT pasta/NN dishes/VBZ were/VBD roughly/RB $/$ 18/CD each/DT and/CC the/DT appetizer/NN was/VBD $/$ 10/CD ,/, if/IN I/PRP remember/VBP correctly/RB ./.
Perfectly/RB priced/VBN for/IN the/DT large/JJ quantity/NN and/CC fresh/JJ quality/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS parts/NNS of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP truly/RB was/VBD a/DT gem/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD definitely/RB a/DT place/NN of/IN the/DT locals/NNS and/CC not/RB touristy/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ vibe/NN for/IN a/DT week/NN night/NN date/NN ./.
The/DT ambiance/NN was/VBD lovely/RB and/CC the/DT kitchen/NN ,/, while/IN open/JJ ,/, was/VBD pretty/RB much/JJ quiet/NN ./.

i/NN try/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT trip/NN here/RB at/IN least/JJS every/CD other/JJ week/NN on/IN my/PRP$ lunch/NN breaks/NNS ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP go/JJ to/TO the/DT ``/`` to/TO go/VB ''/'' side/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/JJ just/RB because/IN i/NNP 'm/NNP grabbing/VBG a/DT quick/JJ lunch/NN during/IN work/NN ./.

i/NN strongly/RB recommend/VB you/PRP going/VB here/RB for/IN a/DT lunch/NN or/CC even/RB a/DT romantic/JJ evening/NN out/IN ./.
Always/NNP a/DT winner/NN !/.
I/PRP only/RB mention/NN this/DT because/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT women/NNS reviewers/NNS commenting/VBG on/IN ``/`` the/DT hot/NN waiters/NNS ''/'' ./.
I/PRP remember/VBP a/DT very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC attractive/JJ female/NNS bartender-/JJ This/DT is/VBZ Scottsdale/NNP ,/, home/NN of/IN the/DT beautiful/JJ people/NNS ./.
Anyway/NNP ,/, I/PRP like/IN this/DT place-/NN Not/RB real/JJ pricey/NN or/CC pretentious/JJ (/NN rare/NN in/IN this/DT town/NN )/NN ./.
Good/NNP basic/JJ food/NN and/CC drinks-/JJ great/JJ service/NN ,/, esp/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN !/NN !/.
Suggest/NNP Linguini/NNP and/CC clams/NNS or/CC calamari/NN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ just/RB something/NN about/IN Sunday/NNP night/NN and/CC pasta/NN ./.
It/PRP goes/VBZ together/RB like/IN .../: tomatoes/NNS and/CC mozzarella/NN ?/.
Last/JJ night/NN ,/, I/PRP made/VBD my/JJ way/NN to/TO this/DT neighborhood/NN pasta/NN shop/NN for/IN a/DT family/NN dinner/NN ./.
My/NNP meal/NN was/VBD spectacular/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Linguini/NNP with/IN seafood/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP pretty/RB sure/JJ the/DT entire/JJ ocean/NN was/VBD on/IN my/PRP$ plate/NN .../: in/IN a/DT good/JJ way/NN ./.
They/PRP brought/VBD out/IN the/DT plate/NN of/IN Linguini/NNP with/IN all/PDT the/DT seafood/NN toppings/NNS including/VBG squid/JJ ,/, shrimp/NN ,/, oysters/NNS ,/, clams/NNS and/CC probably/RB some/DT fish/JJ I/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB name/VB for/IN you/PRP ./.
At/IN any/DT rate/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD delish/JJ !/.
The/DT pasta/NN sauce/NN complimented/VBD the/DT fish/JJ perfectly/RB and/CC I/PRP found/VBD myself/JJ eating/VBG much/RB more/JJR of/IN it/PRP than/IN I/PRP should/MD have/VB ./.
So/IN speaking/NN of/IN seafood/NN ,/, Pasta/NNP Brioni/NNP accidentally/RB must/MD have/VB merged/VBN with/IN a/DT sushi/NN joint/NN last/JJ night/NN and/CC they/PRP accidentally/RB brought/VBP my/JJ Mom/NNP her/NNP halibut/VB more/JJR on/IN the/DT ``/`` still/RB swimming/VBG ''/'' side/NN of/IN the/DT plate/NN rather/RB than/IN cooked/JJ ./.
When/WRB we/PRP brought/VBP it/PRP to/TO the/DT server/NN 's/POS attention/NN he/PRP was/VBD mortified/VBN and/CC I/PRP will/MD say/VB this/DT .../NN Because/NN of/IN how/WRB apologetic/JJ the/DT server/NN was/VBD ,/, how/WRB they/PRP handled/VBD the/DT situation/NN and/CC how/WRB accommodating/JJ they/PRP were/VBD with/IN their/PRP$ mistake/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB see/VB a/DT reason/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT experience/NN alter/NN my/IN impression/NN of/IN Pasta/NNP Brioni/NNP ./.
They/PRP brought/VBD my/PRP$ Mom/NNP out/IN a/DT new/JJ meal/NN in/IN record/JJ time/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD well/RB on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN ,/, after/IN delicious/JJ Tiramisu/NNP and/CC some/DT chocolate/NN mousse/NN plate/NN of/IN goodness/NN of/IN course/NN !/.
In/IN summary/JJ ,/, sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ entirely/RB about/IN how/WRB a/DT restaurant/JJ handles/NNS unfortunate/JJ situations/NNS ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN the/DT kitchen/NN just/RB had/VBD a/DT ``/`` whoops/NNS ''/'' moment/NN and/CC that/IN happens/NNS to/TO the/DT best/JJS of/IN us/PRP ,/, so/RB for/IN that/IN I/PRP give/VBP them/PRP a/DT get/NN out/IN of/IN jail/NN free/JJ card/NN ./.
Other/JJ restaurants/NNS should/MD follow/VB their/PRP$ customer/NN service/NN lead/NN !/.
Plus/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ food/NN coma/NN of/IN happiness/NN from/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ meal/NN ./.
Is/NNP it/PRP bad/VBZ that/IN I/PRP could/MD n't/RB wait/VB for/IN my/PRP$ Mom/NNP to/TO get/VB her/PRP replacement/NN meal/NN and/CC instead/RB scarfed/VBD down/IN my/PRP$ personal/JJ ocean/NN on/IN a/DT plate/NN ?/.
I/PRP did/VBD give/VB her/PRP a/DT little/JJ taste/NN as/IN she/PRP waited/VBD for/IN her/PRP$ own/JJ ./.
Great/NNP atmosphere/RB and/CC when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ cooler/JJ we/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB to/TO sit/NN on/IN the/DT patio/NN we/PRP walked/VBD by/IN !/.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT bunch/NN of/IN ladies/NNS meet/VBG up/RP that/DT have/VBP never/RB been/VBN here/RB before/IN ./.
We/PRP each/VBP tried/VBN a/DT different/JJ dish/JJ while/IN sharing/VBG a/DT bottle/NN of/IN Barbara/NNP red/VBD wine/NN ./.

The/DT service/NN was/VBD prompt/JJ ,/, attentive/JJ ,/, and/CC delivered/VBD with/IN personality/NN (/NNS Mike/VBP -/JJ great/JJ job/NN )/NN ./.
We/PRP started/VBD off/RP sharing/VBG the/DT Beet/NNP salad/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD something/NN I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB had/VBD before/RB ./.
The/DT presentation/NN was/VBD unique/JJ and/CC the/DT flavor/NN ,/, ingredient/JJ ratio/NN ,/, and/CC amount/NNS were/VBD very/RB satisfying/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Chicken/NNP Parmesan/NNP and/CC Chicken/NNP Martini/NNP as/IN entrees/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS in/IN town/NN without/IN a/DT doubt/NN ./.

Medium/NNP pricey/NN but/CC for/IN the/DT food/NN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB complain/VB ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC the/DT ambiance/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ ./.
They/PRP homemade/VBP cheesecake/NN dessert/NN was/VBD the/DT perfect/NN ending/VBG to/TO the/DT meal/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP start/JJ with/IN the/DT Pros/NNP ./.
My/NNP meal/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ I/PRP could/MD n't/RB stop/VB eating/JJ it/PRP ./.
Laid/NNP back/NNP atmosphere/RB ./.
Server/NNP was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC put/RB together/VBD a/DT meal/NN for/IN my/NN friend/NN that/WDT was/VBD n't/RB on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
The/DT cons/NNS were/VBD the/DT portion/NN sizes/NNS were/VBD massive/JJ ./.
I/PRP know/VBP in/IN the/DT Italian/JJ culture/NN pasta/NN is/VBZ served/VBN in/IN big/JJ portions/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP took/VBD half/NN of/IN the/DT dish/JJ home/NN ,/, and/CC pasta/VB the/DT next/JJ day/NN is/VBZ just/RB not/RB the/DT same/JJ ./.
Since/IN the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP high/JJ and/CC you/PRP get/VBP what/WP you/PRP pay/VBP for/IN ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD rather/RB have/VB a/DT smaller/JJR portion/NN with/IN a/DT lower/JJR price/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP what/WP I/PRP believed/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT side/NN ceaser/NN salad/NN ./.
That/DT was/VBD also/RB huge/JJ ,/, seemed/VBD like/IN a/DT whole/JJ head/NN of/IN lettuce/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ,/, maybe/VBP a/DT bit/NN to/TO much/JJ dressing/NN that/IN caused/JJ it/PRP to/TO be/VB not/RB crispy/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD also/RB disappointing/VBG the/DT server/NN did/VBD n't/RB offer/VB to/TO crack/NN pepper/NN on/IN the/DT salad/JJ and/CC pasta/NN ,/, and/CC offer/NN grated/VBD cheese/NN on/IN the/DT pasta/NN ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN happy/JJ with/IN the/DT bread/JJ and/CC salad/JJ and/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN full/JJ for/IN 6.50/CD ./.

I/PRP had/VBD a/DT glass/NN of/IN wine/NN which/WDT was/VBD wonderful/JJ and/CC priced/JJ very/RB well/RB ./.
So/IN I/PRP think/VBP lowering/VBG the/DT prices/NNS and/CC the/DT amount/NN of/IN food/NN they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP can/MD set/VB this/DT place/NN over/IN the/DT top/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN their/PRP$ food/NN at/IN least/JJS a/DT dozen/NN times/NNS ,/, but/CC have/VBP always/RB gotten/VBN it/PRP To-Go/NNP ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ,/, but/CC also/RB not/RB the/DT worst/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ always/RB bland/JJ ,/, no/DT matter/NN which/WDT dish/JJ I/PRP order/VBP ./.
I/PRP always/VBP need/JJ to/TO spice/VB it/PRP up/RB ,/, once/RB I/PRP bring/VBP it/PRP home/-NONE- ./.

Unfortunately/RB it/PRP was/VBD incredibly/RB busy/JJ due/JJ to/TO the/DT marathon/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT auctions/NNS ./.
Meal/NNP tickets/NNS were/VBD getting/VBG lost/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD mass/JJ MASS/NNP chaos/NNS ./.
Our/NNP waiter/NN seemed/VBD aloof/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB after/IN a/DT while/IN he/PRP started/VBD getting/VBG it/PRP together/RB ./.
One/CD thing/NN I/PRP really/RB did/VBD n't/RB appreciate/VB was/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN when/WRB we/PRP got/VBD there/RB they/PRP sat/JJ us/PRP by/IN the/DT door/NN to/TO the/DT outside/JJ patio/NN (/NN which/WDT at/IN the/DT time/NN was/VBD closed/VBN )/NN ./.

Had/RB more/JJR than/IN enough/JJ to/TO take/VB home/NN for/IN another/DT meal/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN had/VBD the/DT eggplant/JJ lasagna/NN ./.
Very/NNP good/NNP ./.
Had/IN the/DT cannoli/NN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
Probably/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/VBN ./.
Why/WRB only/RB four/CD stars/NNS ?/.
The/DT waiter/NN was/VBD completely/RB disinterested/VBN ./.
He/PRP came/VBD over/IN and/CC asked/VBD if/IN we/PRP were/VBD ready/NN to/TO order/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP hesitated/VBD for/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN seconds/NNS ,/, he/PRP immediately/RB said/VBD he/PRP 'd/VBZ come/VB back/RB later/JJ ./.
Really/RB ?/.
After/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN was/VBD served/VBN ,/, he/PRP never/RB returned/VBD to/TO ask/VB how/WRB our/JJ meal/NN was/VBD ./.
Or/NNP to/TO refill/VB our/PRP$ water/NN glass/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, this/DT was/VBD n't/RB some/DT college/NN student/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD apparent/JJ he/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT managers/NNS as/IN he/PRP was/VBD dressed/VBN in/IN a/DT sleeves/NNS rolled/VBD up/RP shirt/NN and/CC slacks/NNS ./.
We/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB again/RB as/IN this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT Phoenix/NNP area/NN that/WDT knows/VBZ how/WRB to/TO cook/VB real/JJ Italian/JJ food/NN that/WDT 's/POS also/RB delicious/JJ and/CC plentiful/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB last/JJ night/NN despite/IN quite/RB a/DT few/JJ yelpers/NNS giving/VBP it/PRP a/DT thumbs/RB down/IN ./.
But/CC like/IN most/JJS things../NN you/PRP kinda/NN just/RB have/VBP to/TO experience/VB it/PRP yourself/VBD no/DT matter/NN what/WP others/NNS say/VBP ./.
Well/NNP the/DT funny/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ I/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT cafe/NN side/NN which/WDT was/VBD completely/RB empty/JJ and/CC the/DT menu/NN was/VBD pretty/RB sparse/JJ compared/VBN to/TO the/DT website/NN ,/, so/RB right/RB then/RB I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ and/CC wished/VBD my/RP date/NN wasnt/NN on/IN his/PRP$ way/NN to/TO meet/VB me/PRP there/RB .../: .../: UNTIL/NNP my/NNP date/NN found/VBD me/PRP and/CC brought/VBD me/PRP to/TO the/DT ``/`` other/JJ side/NN ''/'' which/WDT was/VBD jam/NN packed/VBN and/CC full/JJ of/IN energy../NN not/RB to/TO mention/NN offering/VBG an/DT extensive/JJ menu/NN ./.
Yay/NNP and/CC thank/NNP god/NNP !/.
it/PRP turns/VBZ out/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN is/VBZ more/JJR of/IN the/DT ``/`` to/TO go/VB ''/'' side/NN ./.
Okay/NNP so/RB the/DT rolls/NNS came/VBD out/RP and/CC they/PRP werent/JJ awful/JJ but/CC they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB warm/NN and/CC doughy/JJ which/NNS is/VBZ what/WP i/NN had/VBD expected/VBN from/IN other/JJ reviews../NN but/CC that/DT was/VBD okay/NN ./.
If/IN they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN warm/NN and/CC doughy/JJ I/PRP would/MD have/VB eaten/VBN 10/CD so/IN it/PRP was/VBD actually/RB a/DT better/JJ situation/NN ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT caprese/JJ salad/NN which/WDT they/PRP automatically/RB split/VBP on/IN 2/CD separate/JJ plates/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD great/JJ initiative/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN was/VBD probably/RB the/DT BEST/NNP Caprese/NNP I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
Those/DT tomatoes/NNS were/VBD unspeakably/RB good/JJ !/.
To/TO follow/JJ I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Antipasta/NNP salad/JJ it/PRP was/VBD perefect/JJ I/PRP had/VBD no/DT complaints/NNS whatsoever/NN ./.
My/NNP date/NNP had/VBD a/DT seafood/NN pasta/NN ,/, I/PRP cant/VBD remember/NN which/WDT one/CD and/CC he/PRP was/VBD n't/RB moaning/JJ over/IN it/PRP but/CC he/PRP definitely/RB did/VBD n't/RB complain/VB ./.
So/IN I/PRP guess/VBP it/PRP all/DT depends/NNS on/IN what/WP you/PRP order..maybe/VBP ./.
But/CC I/PRP was/VBD pleased/JJ enough/JJ to/TO return/NN sometime/NN and/CC try/NN something/NN else/RB ,/, no/DT question/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD visiting/VBG the/DT Phoenix/NNP area/NN from/IN Indianapolis/NNP wanted/VBD to/TO find/VB a/DT great/JJ Italian/JJ restaurant/NN for/IN my/PRP$ Mother/NN in/IN law/NN 's/POS birthday/NN ./.
We/PRP chose/VBP Pasta/NNP Brioni/NNP based/VBN on/IN the/DT Yelp/NNP reviews/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN our/PRP$ party/NN of/IN six/CD had/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/JJS dinning/JJ experiences/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ lives/NNS ./.
The/DT location/NN is/VBZ incredibly/RB difficult/JJ to/TO find/NN but/CC after/IN driving/VBG around/IN it/PRP for/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS we/PRP found/VBP it/PRP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD made/VBN a/DT reservation/NN and/CC were/VBD seated/VBN immediately/RB ,/, which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD great/JJ considering/VBG they/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB full/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ where/WRB the/DT service/NN stopped/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD sat/JJ without/IN menus/NN for/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
Once/IN we/PRP had/VBD menus/VBN we/PRP waited/VBD another/DT 10/CD minutes/NNS for/IN the/DT waiter/NN to/TO return/NN and/CC give/NN us/PRP their/PRP$ specials/NNS ./.
Each/DT time/NN the/DT waiter/NN came/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ he/PRP would/MD say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS and/CC then/RB immediately/RB turn/VB and/CC quickly/RB leave/RB ,/, not/RB asking/RB if/IN we/PRP had/VBD any/DT questions/NNS or/CC God/NNP forbid/JJ if/IN we/PRP would/MD like/VB a/DT drink/NN ./.
A/DT member/NN of/IN our/PRP$ party/NN asked/VBD the/DT man/NN helping/NN and/CC serving/VBG bread/NN and/CC water/NN about/IN a/DT menu/NN item/NN ./.
He/PRP refused/VBD to/TO answer/NN only/RB stating/VBG that/IN he/PRP would/MD get/VB the/DT waiter/NN ./.
After/IN reading/PDT the/DT menu/NN for/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS our/PRP$ waiter/NN returned/VBD to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ order/NN ./.
He/PRP took/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN order/NN and/CC turned/NN and/CC left/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO snap/VB my/PRP$ fingers/NNS to/TO get/VB his/PRP$ attention/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD about/IN 10/CD feet/NN away/RB from/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ to/TO get/VB him/PRP to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC finally/RB take/VB our/PRP$ drink/NN order/NN ./.
Once/IN we/PRP had/VBD our/VBN drinks/NNS we/PRP toasted/VBD to/TO the/DT birthday/NN girl/NN during/IN which/WDT I/PRP spilled/VBD my/PRP$ drink/NN ./.
I/PRP quickly/VBP got/VBN up/RP and/CC located/VBD my/RP waiter/NN notified/VBD him/PRP of/IN what/WP had/VBD happened/VBN ./.
He/PRP looked/VBD like/IN a/DT deer/NN in/IN headlights/NNS and/CC asked/VBD me/PRP what/WP we/PRP should/MD do/VB ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN something/NN to/TO clean/VB it/PRP with/IN and/CC was/VBD handed/VBN a/DT few/JJ extra/NN napkins/NNS ./.
Back/NNP at/IN the/DT table/JJ ,/, drink/VBP cleaned/VBN up/RP and/CC waiting/VBG again/RB this/DT time/NN 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ dinner/NN ./.
The/DT manager/NN ?/.
or/CC host/NN ?/.
apologized/JJ and/CC stated/VBD our/JJ meals/NNS would/MD be/VB out/RP shortly/RB ./.
Once/IN the/DT meals/NNS arrived/VBD the/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, not/RB the/DT best/JJS Italian/JJ I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN but/CC by/IN no/DT means/NN the/DT worst/NN either/NN ./.
Definitely/RB not/RB worth/VB the/DT time/NN that/IN it/PRP took/VBD to/TO receive/VB it/PRP ./.
My/NNP rating/NNP is/VBZ based/VBN solely/RB on/IN the/DT terrible/JJ service/NN we/PRP received/VBD and/CC that/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO try/NNS and/CC chase/NN down/IN our/PRP$ waiter/NN to/TO get/VB anything/NN done/NN ./.
