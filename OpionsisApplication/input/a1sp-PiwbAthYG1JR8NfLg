Great/NNP subs/NNS ./.
I/PRP find/VBP that/IN cold/NN sub/NN places/NNS around/IN campus/NNS tend/VBP to/TO be/VB very/RB mediocre/JJ (/NN looking/NN at/IN you/PRP ,/, Jimmy/NNP John/NNP 's/POS )/NN ,/, but/CC Silver/NNP Mine/NNP does/VBZ them/PRP well/RB ./.
Putting/VBG them/PRP above/IN the/DT crowd/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ certainly/RB the/DT avocado/NN spread/NN ,/, which/WDT pairs/NNS well/RB with/IN many/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ sandwiches/NNS ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ to/TO a/DT little/JJ high/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT free/JJ wifi/NN is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO access/NN and/CC very/RB reliable/JJ ,/, making/RB this/DT a/DT regular/JJ stop/NN for/IN me/PRP if/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO go/VB all/PDT the/DT way/NN down/IN to/TO Green/NNP ./.
This/DT Silver/NN Mine/NNP has/VBZ 2/CD strikes/NNS against/IN it/PRP that/IN apply/RB before/IN even/RB entering/VBG the/DT building/NN :/: It/PRP 's/VBZ on/IN the/DT same/JJ strip/NN of/IN vomit/JJ streaked/JJ pavement/NN as/IN Kam/NNP 's/POS and/CC C.O/NNP ./.
's/NN ,/, and/CC one/CD of/IN its/PRP$ other/JJ neighbors/NNS on/IN the/DT same/JJ strip/NN is/VBZ a/DT Subway/NNP ./.
So/IN why/WRB do/VBP I/PRP go/VB there/RB every/DT time/NN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO buy/VB lunch/NN on/IN campus/NNS ?/.
Well/NNP ,/, there/EX are/VBP no/DT scary/JJ cross-eyed/JJ employees/NNS there/RB talking/VBG on/IN their/PRP$ cell/NN phones/VBZ instead/RB of/IN making/VBG sandwiches/NNS (/RB as/IN at/IN subway/NN ./. )/''
Instead/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT totally/RB friendly/JJ crew/NN of/IN regular/JJ sub-makers/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT delicious/JJ and/CC satisfying/JJ selection/NN of/IN subs/NNS ./.
YUM/NNP !/.
Did/NNP n't/RB even/RB get/VB to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN great/JJ things/NNS but/CC i/NN was/VBD stranded/VBN at/IN a/DT hotel/NN that/WDT is/VBZ just/RB under/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS away/RB but/CC they/PRP were/VBD insistent/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD more/RBR like/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS away/RB and/CC refused/VBD to/TO deliver/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN online/NN and/CC had/VBD PREPAID/NNP a/DT pretty/RB generous/JJ tip/NN ./.
Seems/NNS like/IN they/PRP could/MD go/VB an/DT extra/JJ block/NN or/CC two/CD to/TO satisfy/VB a/DT paying/NN customer/NN ./.
FAST/NNP DELIVERY/NNP ./.
DRIVERS/NNP ARE/NNP FRIENDLY/NNP ./.
GREAT/NNP GRILLED/NNP CHICKEN/NNP SALAD/NNP (/NNP you/PRP can/MD add/VB practically/RB anything/NN to/TO it/PRP at/IN no/DT charge/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP that/IN being/VBG in/IN the/DT puke-filled/JJ street/NN is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT plus/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP IS/NNP still/RB right/VBD across/IN from/IN the/DT psych/JJ building/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP enjoyed/VBD ./.
Some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ hot/NN sandwiches/NNS are/VBP very/RB craveable/JJ (/IN the/DT roast/NN beef/NN au/NN jus/VBZ one/CD ,/, and/CC anything/NN with/IN barbeque/NN sauce/NN always/RB appeals/NNS to/TO me/PRP )/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ change/NN of/IN pace/NN from/IN Subway/NNP ,/, and/CC sooo/RB much/RB better/JJR than/IN Jimmy/NNP John/NNP 's/POS ./.
Not/RB a/DT sub/NN fan/NN ./.
All/DT sandwich/JJ stores/NNS taste/VBP the/DT same/JJ with/IN me/PRP ./.
Just/RB had/VBD their/PRP$ delivery/NN at/IN my/PRP$ job/NN and/CC their/PRP$ steak/JJ sandwich/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
Pretty/NNP good/JJ variety/NN of/IN sandwiches/NNS ./.
Their/PRP$ sandwiches/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB big/JJ too/RB and/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB skimp/VB on/IN the/DT meat/NN ./.
The/DT grilled/VBD chicken/VBN they/PRP put/VBP on/IN their/PRP$ sub/NN is/VBZ really/RB juicy/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN flavor/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT step/NN up/IN from/IN Jimmy/NNP John/NNP 's/POS and/CC Subway/NNP for/IN sure/NNP ./.
Definitely/RB recommend/VBP this/DT if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN and/CC do/VBP n't/RB want/VB the/DT ``/`` same/JJ ol/NN '/'' sub/NN place/NN ''/'' ./.
Great/NNP bread/VBD ,/, much/RB better/JJR than/IN Subway/NNP and/CC slightly/RB better/JJR than/IN Jimmy/NNP John/NNP 's/POS ./.
The/DT sandwich/JJ selection/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
The/DT only/JJ downside/NN is/VBZ the/DT wait/JJ time/NN ./.
When/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ slow/JJ it/PRP can/MD take/VB 5/NN minutes/NNS plus/VBZ to/TO get/VB a/DT sandwich/NN ./.
It/PRP seems/VBZ they/PRP are/VBP severely/RB understaffed/JJ ./.
Also/RB when/WRB we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN it/PRP delivered/VBZ it/PRP has/VBZ take/VBN an/DT hour/NN plus/NN ./.
So/RB if/IN you/PRP go/VBP there/RB make/VBP sure/JJ to/TO go/VB after/IN 5/NN for/IN 5/CD dollar/NN large/JJ subs/NNS or/CC small/JJ combos/NNS and/CC use/VB their/PRP$ coupons/NNS as/IN well/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD hungry/JJ after/IN class/NN and/CC decided/VBD to/TO check/VB the/DT Hooked/NNP local/JJ deals/NNS for/IN anything/NN good/NN ./.
I/PRP saw/VBD that/IN Silver/NNP Mine/NNP had/VBD buy/VBN 1/CD get/CD 1/CD on/IN any/DT sub/NN and/CC ran/VBD over/IN there/EX !/.
I/PRP got/VBD one/CD comstock/NN (/NN roast/NN beef/NN )/NN and/CC then/RB a/DT Dodge/NNP City/NNP (/NNP Pepperoni/NNP &/CC Salami/NNP )/NNP ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN the/DT comstock/NN before/IN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ decent/JJ ./.
The/DT Dodge/NNP City/NNP also/RB was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ either/NN ./.
Portion/NN size/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD full/JJ after/IN 1/CD sandwich/JJ and/CC saved/VBD the/DT other/JJ one/CD for/IN another/DT day/NN ./.
Tasted/VBN pretty/RB fresh/JJ and/CC put/JJ together/NN really/RB well/RB ./.
Friendly/RB guys/VBZ behind/IN the/DT counter/NN ./.
I/PRP saved/VBD over/IN $/$ 8/CD with/IN the/DT Hooked/NNP deal/NN and/CC the/DT subs/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ./.
5/5/CD this/DT time/NN !/.
My/NNP favorite/JJ sub/NN place/NN ever/RB .../: .really/RB ./.
We/PRP found/VBD this/DT place/NN visiting/VBG my/NN son/NN at/IN U/NNP of/IN I./NNP I/PRP crave/VBP it/PRP when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP away/RB ./.
Their/NNP bread/VBD is/VBZ always/RB dry/JJ ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ sandwiches/NNS never/RB seem/VBP as/RB fresh/JJ as/IN they/PRP really/RB should/MD be/VB ./.
Other/JJ locations/NNS do/VBP much/RB better/JJR than/IN this/DT one/CD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT shame/NN really/RB ./.
I/PRP actually/RB prefer/VBP Subway/NNP over/IN Silver/NNP Mine/NNP but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ an/DT awesome/NN student/NN meal/NN deal/NN with/IN a/DT jumbo/NN drink/NN and/CC a/DT cookie/NN ./.
Sweet/NNP !/.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN some/DT quick/JJ and/CC fast/JJ subs/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ not/RB what/WP I/PRP got/VBP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT midterm/NN to/TO study/NN for/IN and/CC instead/RB ,/, they/PRP completely/RB forgot/VBP my/JJ order/NN ./.
They/PRP would/MD have/VB completely/RB forgot/VBN if/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB go/VB up/RP and/CC ask/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.
My/NNP time/NN was/VBD absolutely/RB wasted/VBN ./.
Bad/NNP location/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP could/MD care/VB less/RBR since/IN I/PRP only/RB order/VBD delivery/NN from/IN here/RB late/JJ at/IN night/NN ./.
And/CC oh/JJ my/NN god/NN ,/, it/PRP tastes/VBZ soo/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT equation/NN for/IN the/DT tastiness/NN goes/VBZ something/NN like/IN this/DT .../NN Y/NNP =/NNP T*x^2/CD where/WRB T/NNP is/VBZ a/DT function/NN of/IN how/WRB late/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, Y/NNP is/VBZ the/DT Yum/NNP factor/NN ,/, and/CC x/NN .../: I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP x/NN is/VBZ ,/, but/CC it/PRP kind/-NONE- of/IN spells/NNS ``/`` tax/NN .../: ''/'' Price/NN is/VBZ okay/JJ -/JJ delivery/NN total/NN is/VBZ a/DT few/JJ dollars/NNS more/JJR than/IN what/WP I/PRP usually/VBP pay/NN for/IN something/NN like/IN Gumby/NNP 's/POS with/IN haxxor/NN deals/NNS -/JJ and/CC a/DT bit/NN higher/JJR than/IN what/WP you/PRP could/MD get/VB at/IN Subway/NNP for/IN $/$ 5/CD (/CD but/CC not/RB as/IN customizable/JJ )/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP open/JJ late/JJ ,/, and/CC some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ pre-mades/NNS ,/, like/IN the/DT Cripple/NNP Creek/NNP are/VBP just/RB too/RB good/JJ to/TO pass/NN up/IN ./.
Double/NNP 11-in/CD ./.
sub/NN special/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ best/JJ offer/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO drop/NN by/IN the/DT university/NN bookstore/NN during/IN my/PRP$ lunch/NN break/NN so/IN thought/JJ I/PRP 'd/MD just/RB grab/VB a/DT sub/NN while/IN I/PRP was/VBD nearby/JJ ./.
Excellent/NNP decision/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD clean/JJ ,/, the/DT employees/NNS were/VBD helpful/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT sandwich/JJ I/PRP got/VBD ,/, while/IN not/RB terribly/RB cheap/NN ,/, was/VBD well/RB worth/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD much/RB more/JJR filling/NN than/IN the/DT sandwiches/NNS I/PRP like/IN at/IN Subway/NNP ;/: quality/NN meat/NN ,/, plenty/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, fresh/JJ toppings/NNS ,/, nice/JJ bread/NN ./.
Could/NNP n't/RB really/RB ask/VB for/IN more/JJR ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB the/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP on/IN that/DT side/NN of/IN campus/NN for/IN lunch/NN ./.
Initially/RB I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN 4/NN stars/NNS ,/, but/CC their/PRP$ outstanding/JJ service/NN has/VBZ earned/VBN them/PRP the/DT perfect/NN score/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP through/IN campusfood.com/NN 15/CD minutes/NNS before/IN they/PRP closed/VBD and/CC some/DT sort/NN of/IN electronic/JJ delay/NN resulted/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ order/NN arriving/VBG late/NN ,/, after/IN they/PRP put/VBP all/PDT the/DT food/NN away/RB ./.
The/DT manager/NN called/VBD me/PRP at/IN 3:00/CD AM/NNP to/TO tell/NN me/IN he/PRP canceled/VBD my/PRP$ order/NN because/IN they/PRP had/VBD already/RB put/VBN the/DT food/NN away/NN and/CC were/VBD ready/NN to/TO close/NN ./.
He/PRP then/RB gave/VBD me/PRP a/DT credit/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN that/IN I/PRP could/MD use/VB anytime/NN ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP getting/VBG a/DT free/JJ sandwich/NN ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN the/DT actual/JJ food/NN goes/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT good/JJ variety/NN between/IN cold/NN and/CC hot/NN sandwichs/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB tried/VBN any/DT of/IN the/DT cold/NN sandwiches/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP their/VBP hot/NN chicken/NN sandwiches/NNS are/VBP awesome/JJ ./.
The/DT buffalo/NN chicken/NN sandwich/NN has/VBZ a/DT mildly/RB spicy/JJ buffalo/NN sauce/NN with/IN a/DT creamy/NN ranch/NN and/CC melted/VBD provolone/NN cheese/NN on/IN your/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN bread/JJ ./.
Definitely/RB my/JJ favorite/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN subs/NNS and/CC do/VBP n't/RB want/VB the/DT conventional/JJ subway/NN or/CC boring/VBG jimmy/NN johns/NNS ,/, I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP silver/JJR mine/NN subs/NNS ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB on/IN the/DT recommendation/NN of/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN at/IN work/NN ./.
Thursday/IN night/NN I/PRP always/RB need/VBP a/DT quick/JJ dinner/NN ,/, and/CC Silver/NNP Mine/NNP Subs/NNP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB ./.
The/DT guy/JJ working/NN there/EX was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC friendly/RB and/CC he/PRP listened/VBD to/TO me/PRP as/IN I/PRP changed/VBD my/PRP$ order/NN a/DT few/JJ times/NNS ./.
The/DT sandwich/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, though/IN it/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN better/VBN toasted/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT bread/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ thick/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, any/DT place/NN that/IN has/VBZ a/DT sandwich/NN that/WDT includes/VBZ both/DT bacon/NN and/CC avocado/NN is/VBZ a/DT winner/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
Also/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD get/VB a/DT dill/NN pickle/NN instead/RB of/IN chips/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ novel/JJ enough/JJ to/TO give/VB Silver/NNP Mine/NNP Subs/NNP an/DT edge/NN over/IN the/DT nearby/JJ Subway/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ expensive/NN ,/, next/JJ time/NN I/PRP might/MD not/RB get/VB the/DT gigantic/JJ pop/NN ./.
Otherwise/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB pleasant/JJ experience/NN and/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD it/PRP !/.
I/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB !/.
I/PRP finally/RB decided/VBD to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT try/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN I/PRP occasionally/RB walked/VBD by/IN the/DT place/NN after/IN class/NN ,/, I/PRP could/MD n't/RB find/VB the/DT urge/NN to/TO go/VB in/IN ./.
When/WRB a/DT 12/CD PM/NNP class/NN ended/VBD earlier/JJR than/IN planned/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD to/TO Silver/NNP Mine/NNP Subs/NNP with/IN a/DT friend/NN for/IN lunch/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN seemed/VBD clean/JJ and/CC the/DT workers/NNS were/VBD friendly/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT California/NNP Gulch/NNP on/IN wheat/NN and/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN had/VBD the/DT Steam/NNP Engine/NNP ./.
I/PRP paid/VBD about/IN $/$ 8.00/CD for/IN the/DT large/JJ ,/, which/WDT was/VBD said/VBN to/TO be/VB 11/VBN ''/'' ./.
The/DT ingredients/NNS in/IN general/JJ seemed/NN fresher/NN than/IN other/JJ fast/NN food/NN restaurants/NNS but/CC it/PRP could/MD be/VB my/VBN biased/JJ opinion/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT particular/JJ California/NNP Gulch/NNP ,/, it/PRP included/VBD tuna/NN salad/RB ,/, provolone/NN ,/, lettuce/NN ,/, tomato/NN ,/, and/CC sprouts/NNS with/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN banana/NN peppers/NNS and/CC jalepanos/NNS ,/, The/DT additional/JJ ingredients/NNS were/VBD free/JJ ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT tuna/NN salad/RB had/VBD too/RB much/RB sauce/JJ in/IN it/PRP but/CC the/DT bread/NN was/VBD soft/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ ./.
The/DT sandwich/JJ overall/NN had/VBD a/DT clean/JJ taste/NN ./.
