Stepping/NNP into/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT enigma/NN wrapped/VBD in/IN an/DT enigma/NN ./.
Sholay/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB heavily/RB advertised/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ face/NN so/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO expect/NNS ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN name/NN brings/NNS memories/NNS of/IN the/DT legendary/JJ movie/NN and/CC elite/JJ characters/NNS ./.

As/IN you/PRP walk/VBP in/IN you/PRP are/VBP promptly/RB greeted/VBN by/IN two/CD American/JJ white/JJ people/NNS ./.
The/DT instinct/NN as/IN a/DT desi/NN is/VBZ to/TO run/VB away/RB but/CC please/RB resist/VBP this/DT urge/NN ./.
You/PRP find/VBD out/RP the/DT staff/NN ,/, are/VBP owners/NNS and/CC chefs/NNS who/WP love/JJ desi/NN food/NN ./.
The/DT ``/`` white/JJ dude/NN ''/'' who/WP is/VBZ their/PRP$ head/NN chef/NN ,/, could/MD n't/RB be/VB more/RBR ``/`` desi/NN ''/'' when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO spices/NNS and/CC food/NN ./.

Only/RB con/NN :/: they/PRP are/VBP only/RB open/JJ till/NN 7pm/CD ./.
So/IN here/RB 's/VBZ the/DT thing/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ n't/RB an/DT Indian/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
No/DT matter/NN how/WRB you/PRP spin/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT ``/`` naan/JJ ''/'' is/VBZ actually/RB pita/NN ./.
The/DT kind/NN you/PRP buy/VB in/IN stores/NNS ./.
There/EX are/VBP three/CD or/CC four/CD Indian/JJ curries/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN curry/NN ./.
The/DT guy/JJ (/NN there/NN was/VBD only/RB one/CD person/NN there/RB ,/, to/TO cook/VB and/CC work/VB the/DT counter/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB busy/JJ ,/, so/RB hey/JJ )/NNS said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP desi/JJ ,/, you/PRP know/VB what/WP shan/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT boxed/JJ masalas/NN taste/NN like/IN ,/, and/CC this/DT definitely/RB had/VBD that/IN taste/NN ./.
Not/RB saying/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN ,/, but/CC fresh/JJ masalas/NN give/VB a/DT curry/JJ an/DT aroma/NN that/IN this/DT lacked/JJ ./.
The/DT chicken/NN shish/JJ kabob/NN was/VBD bland/JJ ,/, except/NN for/IN the/DT red/VBN chili/NN powder/NN added/VBD liberally/RB on/IN top/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB actual/JJ shish/JJ kabob/NN ./.
The/DT best/JJS thing/NN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD the/DT lamb/NN burger/NN ./.
Oh/NNP my/NNP gosh/NN ./.
The/DT lamb/NN was/VBD super/NN juicy/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT fries/NNS already/RB had/VBD black/JJ pepper/NN ./.
Loved/NNP it/PRP ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ super/NN duper/NN clean/NN ./.
Even/RB the/DT bathroom/NN ./.
Like/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, there/EX was/VBD one/CD person/NN to/TO cook/VB ,/, serve/JJ ,/, answer/JJ calls/NN ,/, and/CC take/VB orders/NNS ./.
He/PRP told/VBD us/PRP the/DT others/NNS were/VBD out/RP for/IN a/DT catering/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ in/IN no/DT way/NN true/IN Indian/JJ food/NN ./.
The/DT shish/JJ kabobs/NNS are/VBP n't/RB Indian/JJ shish/JJ kabobs/NNS ,/, but/CC rather/RB Middle/JJ Eastern/NNP kabobs/NNS ,/, the/DT naan/NN is/VBZ n't/RB true/JJ naan/JJ ,/, either/RB ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB go/VB to/TO this/DT place/NN expecting/VBG awesome/NN Indian/JJ food/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ place/NN to/TO go/VB for/IN a/DT burger/NN or/CC the/DT pizza/NN ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ why/NN my/NN lamb/NN kabob/NN meal/NN took/VBD so/RB long/RB to/TO be/VB ready/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP overheard/VBP something/NN about/IN the/DT rice/NN still/RB cooking/VBG ,/, and/CC this/DT was/VBD at/IN peak/NN lunch/NN hour/NN (/VBD noon/JJ )/NN !/.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/VBD (/NNP almost/RB 20/VBD minutes/NNS for/IN one/CD to-go/NN order/NN with/IN only/RB 2/CD or/CC 3/CD other/JJ customers/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN )/NN was/VBD the/DT waiting/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT employees/NNS were/VBD nice/RB and/CC made/VBD sure/JJ to/TO let/VB me/PRP know/VB that/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB forgotten/VBN ./.
The/DT shish/JJ kabobs/NNS were/VBD tender/VBN and/CC savory/JJ ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ balsamic/JJ vinaigrette/NN for/IN my/PRP$ salad/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD !/VBN !/NNS !/.
The/DT saffron/NN rice/NN was/VBD also/RB delicious/JJ even/RB though/IN it/PRP appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT item/NN that/IN was/VBD delaying/VBG my/NN order/NN ./.
I/PRP should/MD 've/VB called/VBN ahead/RB ,/, but/CC next/JJ time/NN ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ lamb/NN burgers/NNS .../: Limited/NNP menu/NNP but/CC top/JJ quality/NN ingredients/NNS ,/, yummm/NN !/.
3/12/14/CD I/PRP returned/VBP there/RB after/IN work/NN to/TO pick/VB up/RP my/PRP$ lamb/NN burger/NN and/CC side/NN salad/JJ to/TO go/NN ./.
The/DT ground/NN lamb/NN meat/NN was/VBD indeed/VBN tasty/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN by/IN the/DT smallish/JJ size/NN compared/VBN to/TO the/DT bun/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP stick/JJ with/IN the/DT kabobs/NNS and/CC rice/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD told/VBN by/IN the/DT nice/JJ man/NN behind/IN the/DT counter/NN that/IN they/PRP 'll/MD be/VB expanding/VBG the/DT Indian/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN in/IN a/DT few/JJ months/NNS so/RB here/RB 's/POS hoping/JJ they/PRP add/VBP samosas/NNS !/.
Their/PRP$ burgers/NNS are/VBP so/RB juicy/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ ./.
Also/RB greatly/RB priced/VBN ,/, and/CC did/VBD I/PRP mention/VB the/DT burgers/NNS !/.
I/PRP only/RB tried/VBD a/DT beef/NN burger/NN but/CC the/DT chicken/NN looked/VBD so/RB good/JJ !/.
Te/NNP service/NN was/VBD great/JJ with/IN friendly/RB staff/NN ./.
Definitely/RB must/MD try/VB again/RB !/.
Fresh/JJ food/NN .../: exotic/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
Their/NNP tag/NN line/NN says/VBZ it/PRP all/DT !/.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT beef/NN kabob/NN on/IN the/DT recommendation/NN of/IN Phil/NNP ,/, the/DT owner/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT halal/JJ meat/NN was/VBD moist/JJ and/CC spiced/VBD just/RB right/RB .../: absolutely/RB delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT basmati/NN rice/NN was/VBD also/RB spiced/VBN in/IN a/DT subtle/NN way/NN that/IN complemented/VBN the/DT meat/NN ./.
He/PRP brought/VBD me/PRP a/DT sample/NN of/IN the/DT rice/NN pudding/VBG ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, along/JJ with/IN the/DT mango/NN yogurt/NN smoothie/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB a/DT refreshing/NN drink/NN come/IN the/DT hot/NN days/NNS of/IN summer/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD not/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB and/CC try/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ items/NNS that/IN other/JJ Yelpers/NNS have/VBP raved/VBN about/IN !/CD
The/DT friendliest/JJS worker/NN ever/RB works/JJ here/RB ./.
I/PRP think/VBP he/PRP is/VBZ the/DT owner/NN ,/, or/CC just/RB a/DT very/RB friendly/JJ man/NN ./.
Every/NNP time/NN my/NN boyfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP come/VBP here/RB we/PRP get/VBP free/JJ stuff/NN ./.
Last/JJ time/NN it/PRP was/VBD dessert/NN ,/, the/DT other/JJ time/NN it/PRP was/VBD mango/JJ lassi/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ and/CC decent/JJ pricing/NN ./.
Sure/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT most/RBS glamorous/JJ presentations/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ very/RB hungry/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN just/RB opened/VBD up/RP like/IN a/DT 3/CD months/NNS ago/RB ,/, so/IN they/PRP are/VBP pretty/RB eager/JJ to/TO get/VB customers/NNS in/IN ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP come/VBN to/TO Afandi/NNP a/DT lot/NN and/CC would/MD have/VB never/RB noticed/VBN the/DT Sholay/NNP restaurant/NN sign/NN if/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB for/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD heard/VBN about/IN it/PRP through/IN yelp/JJ but/CC did/VBD n't/RB expect/VB to/TO try/VB it/PRP out/IN anytime/JJ soon/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD taken/VBN back/RB by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT owner/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD not/RB Indian/JJ !/.
He/PRP was/VBD VERY/NNP friendly/RB though/IN and/CC so/RB I/PRP give/VBP this/DT place/NN a/DT 5/NN for/IN customer/NN service/NN !/.
After/IN having/JJ asked/NNS if/IN the/DT meat/NN was/VBD halal/JJ ,/, the/DT owner/NN told/VBD us/PRP that/IN everything/NN was/VBD halal/JJ except/NN for/IN the/DT beef/NN pepperoni/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP very/RB grateful/JJ that/IN he/PRP not/RB only/RB verbally/RB stated/VBN it/PRP ,/, but/CC has/VBZ it/PRP written/VBZ down/RP on/IN the/DT menu/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD n't/RB really/RB starving/JJ so/IN we/PRP placed/VBP an/DT order/NN for/IN halal/JJ wings/NNS &/CC fries/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT pizza/NN naan/JJ (/NN with/IN chicken/NN ,/, cheese/NN and/CC pizza/NN sauce/NN )/NN ./.
He/PRP asked/VBD us/PRP if/IN we/PRP wanted/VBP him/PRP to/TO make/VB it/PRP spicy/NN ,/, and/CC like/IN most/JJS Indians/NNS and/CC Pakistanis/NNP ,/, OF/NNP COURSE/NNP we/NNP said/VBD yes/NNS ./.
So/IN he/PRP made/VBD added/VBD chillies/NNS as/IN well/RB ./.
Fast/NNP forward/NN to/TO the/DT food/NN -/NN the/DT halal/NN wings/NNS were/VBD GREAT/NNP ./.
Spicy/NNP ,/, but/CC a/DT little/JJ too/NN breaded/VBD ./.
My/NNP bf/VBD noticed/VBN this/DT as/RB well/RB ,/, and/CC was/VBD the/DT first/JJ one/CD to/TO point/VB it/PRP out/IN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS came/VBD out/RP extremely/RB salty/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP finished/VBD the/DT majority/NN of/IN them/PRP anyways/RB ./.
The/DT pizza/NN naan/NN was/VBD good/JJ !/NN
Especially/RB if/IN you/PRP like/VBP chicken/VBN keema/NN !/.
The/DT chillies/NNS the/DT owner/NN added/VBD made/VBN it/PRP spicy/NN and/CC quite/JJ scrumptious/JJ ./.
The/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ trip/NN to/TO this/DT place/NN was/VBD definitely/RB the/DT MANGO/NNP LASSI/NNP ./.
The/DT owner/NN gave/VBD us/PRP each/DT a/DT sample/NN which/WDT led/-NONE- us/VBD to/TO ordering/JJ one/CD ./.
The/DT lassi/NN was/VBD thick/JJ ,/, unlike/JJ many/JJ other/JJ places/NNS you/PRP order/VBP a/DT lassi/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP could/MD taste/VB the/DT yogurt/NN ./.
YUM/NNP ./.
The/DT owner/NN also/RB gave/VBD us/PRP a/DT sample/NN of/IN the/DT rice/NN pudding/VBG ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN big/JJ of/IN a/DT fan/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB the/DT biggest/JJS sugar/NN addict/NN but/CC I/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB feeling/JJ it/PRP ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP to/TO come/VB back/RB for/IN the/DT lamb/NN burger/NN and/CC the/DT lassi/NN next/JJ time/NN !/.
Overall/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB entirely/RB ``/`` Sholay/NNP ''/'' ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN Indian/JJ (/NN as/IN in/IN ''/'' desi/NN khana/NN ''/'' )/NN food/NN ,/, go/NNP elsewhere/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN American/JJ styled/JJ Indian/JJ food/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ your/VBG place/NN ./.
First/NNP impression/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ very/RB clean/JJ but/CC a/DT little/JJ confusing-/JJ you/PRP walk/VBP in/IN and/CC see/VB a/DT buffet-type/NN set/VBN up/RP ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB being/VBG utilized/VBN and/CC looks/NNS like/IN there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN junk/NN around/IN the/DT kitchen/NN area/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD immediately/RB greeted/VBN and/CC handed/VBD a/DT menu/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ American/JJ breakfast/NN specialties/NNS on/IN the/DT front/NN ,/, and/CC inside/NN is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ kabob/NN selection/NN ,/, naan/JJ pizzas/NNS ,/, and/CC burgers/NNS ./.
Very/NNP odd/VBD combination/NN of/IN offerings/NNS ./.
Ordered/IN the/DT chicken/NN kabob/NN platter/NN to/TO go/VB ,/, and/CC was/VBD offered/VBN a/DT breaded/JJ chicken/NN wing/VBG to/TO sample/NN while/IN I/PRP waited-/VBP they/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG out/IN new/JJ menu/NN items/NNS ./.
The/DT wing/NN was/VBD huge/JJ and/CC mostly/RB composed/VBD of/IN breading/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB what/WP I/PRP 'm/VBP looking/VBG for/IN at/IN all/DT when/WRB I/PRP 'm/VBP ordering/VBG wings/NNS ./.
Flavor/NNP was/VBD okay/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT wing/NN itself/NN was/VBD just/RB weird/JJ ./.
Got/NN home/NN with/IN my/JJ food/NN in/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ amount/NN of/IN time/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC hot-/JJ the/DT kabobs/NNS were/VBD delicious/JJ ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ BF/NNP snagged/VBD a/DT few/JJ bites/NN even/RB after/IN devouring/VBG his/PRP$ sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT rice/NN in/IN particular/JJ was/VBD very/RB good/JJ :/: I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB one/CD to/TO rave/VB about/IN rice/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD moist/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ ,/, and/CC had/VBD some/DT white/JJ ,/, some/DT yellow/JJ ,/, and/CC some/DT orange/NN in/IN it-/JJ likely/JJ a/DT combination/NN of/IN white/JJ and/CC saffron/JJ rice/NN ,/, with/IN additional/JJ seasonings/NNS ./.
The/DT naan/JJ and/CC salad/JJ were/VBD also/RB fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT portion/NN was/VBD generous/JJ ,/, and/CC on/IN par/NN with/IN the/DT $/$ 10/CD total/CD ./.
Best/NNP part/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN was/VBD the/DT cilantro/NN sauce/NN for/IN the/DT kabobs-/JJ it/PRP was/VBD killer/NN ./.
Highly/RB recommend/NN ,/, get/VB it/PRP on/IN anything/NN ./.
