Been/NNP there/NNP twice/NN ./.

Even/RB though/IN the/DT Basak/NNP specializes/VBZ in/IN Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT worse/NN Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP rather/RB spend/VB the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN money/NN for/IN twice/NN as/IN much/JJ and/CC better/JJR chicken/NN at/IN KFC/NNP ,/, or/CC get/VB much/JJ better/NN fried/VBN chicken/NN at/IN Chez/NNP Bong/NNP or/CC Les/NNP Saisons/NNP de/NNP Corée/NNP two/CD streets/NNS down/IN ./.
Their/NNP portions/NNS and/CC the/DT juiciness/NN of/IN the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD way/NN below/IN expectation/NN ./.
The/DT flavour/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC does/VBZ n't/RB compensate/VB for/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN why/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP giving/VBG a/DT 3/NN stars/NNS is/VBZ because/IN of/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ very/RB clean/JJ and/CC a/DT few/JJ screens/NNS are/VBP playing/VBG kpop/NN videos/NNS ./.

Trop/NNP cher/NN pour/NN ce/NN que/JJ c'est/NN ./.

Un/IN peu/NN trop/NN sucré/NN ,/, ce/NN qui/RB peut/JJ tomber/NN sur/NN le/NN cœur/NN à/VBD la/NN longue/NN ,/, mais/VBZ le/JJ daikon/NN (/NN radis/VBZ )/JJ mariné/NN permet/NN de/IN changer/NN le/NN goût/NN entre/VB deux/NN bouchées/NNS ./.
Le/NNP poulet/VBD était/JJ bien/NN croustillant/NN et/NN goûtait/NN bon/NN ,/, mais/VBZ ne/JJ vaut/NN pas/VBZ le/NN prix/NN demandé/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO be/VB be/VB impartial/JJ and/CC totally/RB unbiased/JJ ,/, but/CC if/IN a/DT place/NN makes/VBZ plain/NN fried/VBD chicken/VBN wings/NNS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP delicious/JJ enough/JJ to/TO eat/NN on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP first/JJ rate/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP love/VBP sticky/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ ,/, and/CC salty/NN chicken/NN ,/, then/RB their/PRP$ soy/JJ garlic/NN wings/NNS (/VBP and/CC pieces/VBZ )/NN may/MD just/RB become/VB addictive/JJ ./.
All/DT I/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ some/DT soy/JJ garlic/NN wings/NNS ,/, rice/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT included/NN daikon/NN cubes/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT happy/NN lady/NN !/.

A/DT few/JJ things/NNS to/TO note/NN :/: it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB as/RB fast/JJ as/IN fast/JJ food/NN (/NN which/WDT is/VBZ good/JJ because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ fresh/JJ )/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ at/IN a/DT higher/JJR price/NN point/NN (/IN I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP but/CC YMMV/NNP )/NNP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB into/IN this/DT store/NN ,/, I/PRP even/RB ordered/VBD 250/IN $/$ of/IN fried/VBN chicken/NN here/RB for/IN my/PRP$ birthday/NN party/NN ./.

The/DT owner/NN just/RB refuse/VBP they/PRP made/VBD a/DT mistake/NN and/CC keep/VB saying/JJ this/DT is/VBZ what/WP they/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO waste/VB money/NN to/TO make/VB another/DT dish/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT service/NN attitude/NN is/VBZ really/RB disappointing/VBG ./.

I/PRP suggest/VBP Mon/NNP Ami/NNP and/CC Dawa/NNP ,/, they/PRP might/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ far/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT portion/NN is/VBZ much/JJ bigger/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ cute/JJ and/CC modern/JJ and/CC the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB and/CC quick/RB and/CC their/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ soooooo/RB good/JJ
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB far/RB from/IN where/WRB I/PRP live/VBP so/RB I/PRP thought../VBP Let/NNP 's/POS give/NN it/PRP a/DT shot/NN !/.
Meh/NNP .../:
I/PRP expected/VBD more/JJR from/IN the/DT reviews/NNS :/: -//JJ You/PRP get/VBP very/RB small/JJ portions/NNS for/IN the/DT price/NN (/VBD $/$ 28/CD for/IN an/DT Half/NNP n/NN '/POS Half/NNP ,/, with/IN nothing/NN else/RB than/IN the/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN itself/NNS and/CC a/DT little/JJ side/NN of/IN white/JJ pickled/JJ radish/JJ .../NN )/NN ./.
The/DT original/JJ fried/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD too/RB dry/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT spicy/NN marinated/VBD fried/VBN chicken/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
Juicy/NNP and/CC savoury/JJ ,/, very/RB spicy/JJ :/: )/JJ The/DT service/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ though/NN ,/, even/RB for/IN a/DT take/JJ out/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ nice/RB ,/, simple/NN and/CC clean/NN ./.
But/CC do/VBP n't/RB go/VB for/IN the/DT quantity/NN .../: Also/RB ,/, I/PRP liked/VBD that/IN they/PRP ask/VBP if/IN you/PRP want/VBP the/DT bones/NNS or/CC not/RB ./.
Hopefully/RB you/PRP 'll/MD like/VB it/PRP when/WRB u/JJ go/NN !/.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD really/RB bad/JJ and/CC disrespectful/JJ ./.
Forcing/VBG the/DT customers/NNS to/TO order/NN as/IN per/IN the/DT need/NN of/IN their/PRP$ business/NN was/VBD not/RB an/DT appreciable/JJ attitude/NN ./.
The/DT buldak/NN chicken/NN is/VBZ AMAZING/NNP if/IN you/PRP like/VBP spicy/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB had/VBD the/DT half/NN and/CC half/DT boneless/NN chicken/NN (/NN hot/NN and/CC garlic/JJ )/NNS and/CC an/DT order/NN of/IN sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ chicken/NN among/IN some/DT other/JJ odds/NNS and/CC ends/NNS and/CC everything/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
the/DT soju/NN is/VBZ definitely/RB worth/VBG a/DT try/NN but/CC its/PRP$ a/DT bit/JJ strong/JJ to/TO drink/VB with/IN dinner/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
they/PRP have/VBP kpop/VBN videos/NNS playing/VBP on/IN the/DT TVs/NNP which/NNP is/VBZ cool/NN ./.
the/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP wish/VBP they/PRP had/VBD were/VBD some/DT Korean/JJ beers/NNS and/CC sodas/NNS ./.
they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP a/DT small/JJ handful/NN of/IN Korean/NNP drinks/VBZ but/CC nothing/NN that/IN is/VBZ really/RB refreshing/VBG enough/RB to/TO have/VB with/IN dinner/NN ./.
that/DT is/VBZ just/RB my/VBG opinion/NN though/IN ./.
the/DT food/NN seems/VBZ very/RB authentic/JJ to/TO me/PRP although/IN I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN to/TO korea/NN ,/, however/RB all/DT three/CD times/NNS I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN here/RB approximately/RB half/DT of/IN the/DT customers/NNS were/VBD Korean/NNP so/IN I/PRP suppose/VBP that/IN must/MD mean/VB something/NN considering/VBG the/DT amount/NN of/IN other/JJ Korean/NNP spots/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN that/IN do/VBP n't/RB seem/VB to/TO have/VB an/DT abundance/NN of/IN Korean/NNP customers/NNS like/IN this/DT place/NN does/VBZ ./.
My/NNP God/NNP !/.

With/IN Korean/NNP Pop/NNP videos/VBZ playing/NN on/IN all/DT flat/JJ screens/NNS ,/, see-through/JJ plastic/JJ chairs/NNS and/CC Korean/NNP Fried/NNP Chicken/NNP ,/, what/WP else/RB do/VBP you/PRP need/VBP ?/.
I/PRP can/MD see/VB the/DT pre-hockey/NN game/NN crowd/NN coming/VBG here/RB for/IN beer/NN and/CC chicken/NN wings/NNS but/CC I/PRP think/VBP to/TO just/RB limit/VB yourself/NN and/CC not/RB trying/VBG out/IN the/DT different/JJ varieties/NNS of/IN fried/JJ chicken/NN (/NN soy/JJ garlic/NN ,/, spicy/NN )/NN ,/, the/DT tempura/NN veggies/VBZ then/RB you/PRP might/MD be/VB missing/VBG out/RP ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT craziest/NN part/NN is/VBZ watching/VBG the/DT Korean/NNP pop/NN videos/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT cultural/JJ experience/NN in/IN itself/NN ./.
The/DT spicy/NN wings/NNS there/EX 's/VBZ are/VBP amazing/VBG best/IN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
Great/NNP service/NN and/CC there/EX establishment/NN is/VBZ very/RB clean/JJ and/CC pleasing/VBG to/TO enter/VB ./.
Very/NNP mediocre/NN fried/VBD chicken/VBN but/CC terrible/JJ service/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT food/NN for/IN delivery/NN and/CC it/PRP took/VBD an/DT hour/NN and/CC twenty/NN minutes/NNS ./.
Chicken/NNP was/VBD no/RB longer/JJR crunchy/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ by/IN then/RB ./.
Owner/NNP had/VBD the/DT audacity/NN to/TO call/VB me/PRP and/CC tell/VBP me/PRP to/TO tip/VB before/IN I/PRP even/RB received/VBD my/PRP$ food/NN ./.
Great/NNP chicken/NN ,/, terrible/JJ service/NN ./.
Waited/NNP more/JJR than/IN an/DT hour/NN for/IN delivery/NN ,/, had/VBD to/TO call/VB back/RB many/JJ times/NNS to/TO confirm/VB if/IN the/DT deliveryman/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT way/NN ./.
When/WRB he/PRP arrived/VBD ,/, very/RB unprofessional/JJ ./.
Did/NNP not/RB know/VB how/WRB much/JJ change/NN to/TO give/VB ,/, and/CC was/VBD pulling/VBG it/PRP out/IN of/IN a/DT wallet/NN as/IN if/IN he/PRP was/VBD fumbling/VBG to/TO give/VB change/NN to/TO a/DT homeless/JJ person/NN ./.
He/PRP even/RB had/VBD the/DT nerve/JJ to/TO brashly/RB ask/VB me/PRP ,/, 'So/NNP how/WRB much/JJ tip/NN will/MD you/VB give/VB me/PRP ?/. '/''
I/PRP gave/VBD him/PRP a/DT tip/NN so/IN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB to/TO deal/NN with/IN him/PRP anymore/RB ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD colder/JJR than/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD so/RB amazing/JJ that/IN I/PRP actually/RB was/VBD inclined/VBN to/TO write/VB a/DT review/NN on/IN yelp/NN ./.
I/PRP took/VBD my/NN girfriend/NN there/EX for/IN dinner/NN after/IN seeing/VBG some/DT pictures/NNS from/IN Instagram/NNP of/IN Basak/NNP and/CC to/TO get/VB to/TO the/DT point/NN :/: we/PRP loved/VBD everything/NN about/IN it/PRP ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT half/NN and/CC half/NN with/IN classic/JJ and/CC spicy/JJ chicken/NN ./.
The/DT spicy/NN chicken/NN was/VBD super/NN flavourful/JJ and/CC the/DT classic/NN was/VBD lightly/RB salted/VBN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD just/RB fried/VBN so/IN the/DT skin/NN was/VBD just/RB the/DT right/NN amount/NN of/IN crispy/NN and/CC the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD super/NN tender/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD some/DT beer/NN and/CC rice/NN to/TO accompany/VB the/DT meal/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD an/DT absolute/JJ delight/NN ./.
Definitely/RB the/DT best/JJS friend/NN chicken/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN tried/JJ so/RB far/RB in/IN Montreal/NNP (/NNP sorry/JJ Poulet/NNP Bronze/NNP )/NNP ./.
If/IN you/PRP like/VBP fried/VBN chicken/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD like/VB this/DT place/NN ./.
Delicious/NNP ,/, crispy/NN Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN that/IN came/VBD out/RP nice/JJ and/CC hot/NN and/CC juicy/NN ,/, not/RB dry/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
My/NNP family/NN and/CC I/PRP shared/VBD the/DT special/NN that/IN includes/VBZ a/DT pitcher/NN and/CC 2/CD types/NNS of/IN chicken/NN -/JJ Original/NNP and/CC Spicy/NNP ./.
This/DT feeds/NNS two/CD people/NNS so/IN we/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT medium/NN size/NN Soy/NNP Garlic/NNP boneless/NN chicken/NN ./.
Would/NNP recommend/NN ordering/VBG a/DT large/JJ size/NN or/CC another/DT medium/NN order/NN for/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN 4/CD ./.
Glad/IN we/PRP stumbled/VBD upon/IN this/DT restaurant/NN during/IN our/PRP$ Montreal/NNP visit/NN !/.
Thought/NNP this/DT place/NN was/VBD legit/JJ 4.5/5/CD until/IN a/DT friend/NN (/NN whose/WP$ palate/NN is/VBZ sorta/RB missing/VBG )/NNS told/VBD me/PRP it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ ./.
So/IN I/PRP became/VBD wary/JJ and/CC decided/VBD to/TO order/NN less/NNS ./.
Well/NNP ,/, looking/VBG back/RB ,/, thank/NN f*ck/NN for/IN that/DT ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB go/VB about/IN spending/NN 20/VBD $/$ +/CD at/IN KFC/NNP ,/, so/RB why/IN would/MD I/PRP do/VBP so/RB here/RB ?/.
Turns/NNP out/NNP ,/, the/DT speciality/NN fried/VBD chicken/NN is/VBZ probably/RB just/RB a/DT less/JJR oily/JJ version/NN of/IN pop/NN corn/NN chicken/NN from/IN Popeye/NNP 's/POS ,/, or/CC some/DT sort/NN of/IN general/JJ tao/NN chicken/NN ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB pay/VB 14/VBN $/$ for/IN half/DT a/DT plate/NN of/IN general/JJ tao/NN chicken/NN (/VBD 24/RB $/$ for/IN a/DT full/JJ plate/NN )/NN ,/, why/WRB do/VBP so/RB here/RB --/: and/CC ,/, what/WP 's/POS korean/JJ about/IN it/PRP ?/.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT garlic/NN and/CC soya/NN boneless/NN fried/VBD chicken/VBN (/NN tastes/NNS just/RB like/IN tao/NN chicken/NN )/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT 2/CD other/JJ 'flavours/NNS '/POS are/VBP 'classic/JJ '/NNS and/CC 'spicy/NN '/POS --/: very/RB interesting/JJ choices/NNS hmm/NN ./.
Anyway/NNP the/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/IN reviewers/NNS raved/VBD about/RB is/VBZ the/DT 'buldak/JJ '/NN ,/, or/CC in/IN english/JJ ,/, extra/JJ spicy/NN chicken/NN .../:
Extra/NNP spicy/NN turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB extra/JJ disappointing/NN ./.
Basically/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT stir/JJ fry/NN of/IN chicken/NN with/IN onions/NNS ,/, carrots/NNS ,/, and/CC daikons/NNS in/IN a/DT korean/JJ sauce/NN (/NN dry/JJ rub/NN in/IN water/NN )/NN ./.
Annnnd/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB barely/RB spicy/VB ./.
Price-wise/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ 20/VBN $/$ for/IN that/DT average/JJ sized/JJ plate/NN (/NN refer/NN to/TO pictures/NNS below/IN )/NNS .../: which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ 150/CD %/NN the/DT price/NN of/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ worth/JJ ./.
Now/IN some/DT of/IN you/PRP are/VBP saying/VBG 'well/NN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB tried/VBN their/PRP$ chicken/NN wings/NNS '/POS ./.
My/NNP answer/NN :/: fk/JJ datttt/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT boneless/NN chicken/NN is/VBZ already/RB kinda/NN dry/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO think/VB about/IN how/WRB tough/JJ the/DT wings/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB when/WRB the/DT heat/NN finally/RB cooks/VBZ through/IN the/DT bones/NNS ./.
What/WP I/PRP liked/VBD about/IN this/DT place/NN though/IN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN bell/NN you/PRP can/MD ring/VB for/IN service/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP give/VBP 10/CD %/NN off/IN for/IN people/NNS with/IN the/DT MCSS/NNP card/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB spacious/JJ and/CC K-pop/JJ videos/NNS are/VBP played/VBN on/IN two/CD TV/JJ screens/NNS ./.
The/DT owners/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB nice/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP figured/VBD that/IN they/PRP 'd/MD better/VB be/VB extra/JJ nice/JJ ,/, because/IN what/WP they/PRP 're/VBP cashing/VBG in/IN for/IN their/PRP$ KFC/NNP rip/NN off/NN is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT stunt/JJ (/NN and/CC definitely/RB worth/VBD that/IN 4.5/5/CD )/NNS ./.
But/CC as/RB much/RB as/IN their/PRP$ food/NN goes/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT 2.5/5/CD :/: no/DT go/NN ./.

Nothing/NN compare/NN to/TO other/JJ patbingsu/NN I/PRP had/VBD before/RB ./.

Being/VBG the/DT only/JJ Korean/NNP Fried/NNP chicken/NN place/NN in/IN downtown/NN Montreal/NNP is/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ advantage/NN ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ for/IN sure/NN ./.
Overall/IN good/JJ experience/NN ./.
Kpop/NNP music/JJ ,/, Korean/NNP Fried/NNP Chicken/NNP in/IN Downtown/NNP ./.
Good/NNP place/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN is/VBZ super/NN nice/NN and/CC the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN tastes/VBZ really/RB clean/JJ ,/, simple/NN and/CC not/RB too/RB greasy/JJ ,/, also/RB the/DT portions/NNS are/VBP good/JJ too/RB but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ slightly/RB pricey/JJ !/.
Still/RB ,/, would/MD go/VB here/RB again/RB :/: )/NNP yum/NN
Located/NNP downtown/NN next/JJ to/TO Concordia/NNP ,/, The/DT Basak/NNP is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ and/CC cute/JJ Korean/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ seeing/NN that/IN they/PRP had/VBD an/DT electronic/JJ device/NN that/IN you/PRP could/MD ring/VB to/TO call/VB the/DT waiter/NN ./.
However/RB I/PRP do/VBP think/RB that/IN for/IN a/DT small/JJ size/NN restaurant/NN like/IN this/DT one/NN ,/, one/CD should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO communicate/VB directly/RB with/IN the/DT server/NN with/IN the/DT wave/NN of/IN a/DT hand/NN or/CC an/DT eye/JJ contact/NN ./.
Food/NNP does/VBZ look/RB good/JJ on/IN picture/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP can/MD get/VB dull/NN if/IN you/PRP order/VBP only/RB chicken/VBN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/RB ,/, the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ tasty/NN and/CC well/RB cooked/VBD ./.
We/PRP tried/VBP both/DT the/DT original/JJ and/CC the/DT garlic/soya/NN sauce/NN ,/, both/DT were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, I/PRP recommend/VBP the/DT combo/NN plate/NN with/IN half/NN of/IN both/DT ./.
Price/NN point/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ bit/NN high/NNS for/IN fried/VBN chicken/NN ,/, especially/RB because/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB come/VB with/IN any/DT sides/NNS ./.
You/PRP can/MD order/VB either/DT a/DT half/NN chicken/NN or/CC whole/NN ,/, with/IN bones/NNS or/CC without/IN ./.
I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB ordering/VBG a/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN and/CC splitting/VBG it/PRP in/IN 2-3/CD ,/, since/IN the/DT portions/NNS are/VBP n't/RB that/IN big/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ definitively/RB a/DT heavy/JJ meal/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD 've/VB appreciated/VBN it/PRP if/IN it/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT salad/JJ and/CC rice/NN (/IN they/PRP probably/RB have/VBP a/DT plate/NN like/IN this/DT for/IN lunch/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP should/MD make/VB it/PRP available/JJ for/IN diner/NN as/RB well/RB )/IN ./.
Rice/NNP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB ordered/VBN separately/RB ,/, and/CC there/EX were/VBD n't/RB much/JJ choice/NN for/IN healthy/JJ veggies/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
Funny/NNP thing/VBD that/IN happened/JJ during/IN my/PRP$ visit/NN was/VBD that/IN we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN that/IN they/PRP sold/VBD out/RP on/IN rice/NN !/.
How/NNP does/VBZ that/IN even/RB happen/VB in/IN an/DT asian/JJ restaurant/NN ?/.
I/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ surprised/VBN since/IN it/PRP was/VBD around/IN 7pm/CD ./.
TLDR/NNP ;/: somehow/JJ expensive/NN ,/, cute/JJ decor/NN ,/, dry/JJ meal/NN ,/, quick/JJ fix/NN ,/, slow/JJ service/NN ,/, share/NN plates/NNS ,/, eat/JJ your/NN 8-9/CD portions/NNS of/IN fruits/vegetables/NNS at/IN home/NN ./.
Bon/NNP restaurant/VBD coréen/VBN !/.
Ambiance/NNP fast-food/NNP ./.
Plat/NNP assez/NN épicés/VBZ à/JJ mon/NN goût/NN !/.
J'avais/NNP commandé/NN comme/NN une/JJ Kimari/NNP Tempura/NNP qui/NNP était/JJ savoureux/NN ./.
Mon/NNP plat/NN principal/NN était/NN un/JJ poulet/NN braisé/NN épicé/NN !/.
Cool/NNP little/VBD spot/NN for/IN some/DT Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN and/CC drinks/VBZ ./.
The/DT Basak/NNP also/RB has/VBZ a/DT cool/NN little/JJ feature/NN of/IN a/DT table/JJ side/NN buzzer/button/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ you/PRP to/TO buzz/NN in/IN a/DT waiter/NN to/TO order/VB more/JJR food/NN or/CC drinks/NNS ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, price/NN is/VBZ alright/RB ,/, boneless/NN fried/VBD chicken/NN was/VBD crispy/JJ ,/, pickled/JJ daikon/NN is/VBZ always/RB great/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT vegetable/JJ tempura/NN that/IN they/PRP served/VBD was/VBD something/JJ new/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.
Potato/NNP ,/, sweet/JJ potato/NN ,/, onions/NNS ,/, green/JJ onions/NNS mixed/VBN into/IN a/DT patty/NN and/CC tempura/NN fried/VBD was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT marinated/VBN chicken/NN (/NNS yang/VBP nyum/NN chicken/VBN )/NN with/IN chicken/NN and/CC green/JJ onions/NNS (/VBP pa-dak/JJ )/NN via/IN phone/NN ./.
The/DT lady/NN I/PRP spoke/VBP to/TO was/VBD very/RB calm/JJ and/CC was/VBD very/RB sweet/JJ sounding/VBG ./.
She/PRP told/VBD us/PRP it/PRP would/MD take/VB 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO arrive/VB ./.
Usually/RB it/PRP takes/VBZ about/IN 50/CD minutes/NNS according/VBG to/TO my/NNP brother/NN so/IN I/PRP was/VBD hopeful/JJ ./.
Nope/NN ./.
I/PRP heard/VBD a/DT knock/NN about/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS past/JJ an/DT hour/NN ./.
Not/RB impressed/VBN at/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP handed/VBD the/DT guy/JJ the/DT money/NN from/IN my/PRP$ wallet/NN ,/, and/CC as/IN I/PRP was/VBD reaching/VBG into/IN my/PRP$ pocket/NN to/TO give/VB him/PRP change/VB for/IN the/DT complete/JJ 12/CD %/NN tip/NN (/NNP btw/NN ,/, the/DT lowest/JJS I/PRP tip/VBP is/VBZ 10/CD %/NN for/IN the/DT slow/rude/NN people/NNS )/RB ,/, he/PRP looks/VBZ at/IN me/PRP and/CC tells/VBZ me/PRP ``/`` uhh/JJ people/NNS usually/RB tip/VBD 10/CD %/NN ./. ''/''
.../: .../: .../: .../: .../:
So/IN I/PRP fished/VBD out/RP the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB after/IN I/PRP gave/VBD him/PRP a/DT 12/CD %/NN tip/NN ,/, he/PRP left/VBD grudgingly/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP an/DT 45/NN minutes/VBZ late/JJ from/IN the/DT expected/VBN time/NN ,/, and/CC 30/CD minutes/NNS late/JJ from/IN the/DT usual/JJ time/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB bother/VB calling/JJ us/NN ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/VB expect/VB a/DT good/JJ tip/NN .../: At/IN least/JJS in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN ./.
With/IN two/CD cokes/NNS ,/, minus/VBZ the/DT tip/NN ,/, the/DT total/NN was/VBD about/IN $/$ 62/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ hella/JJ expensive/NN ./.
My/NNP brother/NN and/CC I/PRP finished/VBP it/PRP and/CC were/VBD content/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP definitely/RB could/MD have/VB made/VBN three/CD times/NNS the/DT amount/NN with/IN $/$ 30/CD ,/, marinade/NN and/CC all/DT ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, the/DT place/NN is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN cravings/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP certainly/RB do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO order/NN from/IN here/RB often/RB otherwise/VB my/PRP$ wallet/NN will/MD be/VB lighter/NN and/CC my/NN conscience/NN will/MD be/VB heavier/JJ ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD this/DT place/NN out/IN after/IN discovering/NN it/PRP was/VBD so/RB close/JJ to/TO the/DT hotel/NN I/PRP was/VBD staying/VBG in/IN ./.
My/NNP group/NN of/IN three/CD ordered/NNS take/VB out/RP -/JJ half/NN fried/VBN and/CC half/DT spicy/NN marinated/VBD chicken/NN to/TO share/NN ./.
First/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT price/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT portion/NN size/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT small/JJ side/NN ./.
Given/NNP that/IN the/DT walk/NN from/IN the/DT restaurant/NN to/TO the/DT hotel/NN was/VBD maybe/JJ five/CD minutes/NNS ,/, I/PRP expected/VBP the/DT chicken/NN to/TO still/RB be/VB crisp/NN ./.
The/DT fry/NN batter/NN was/VBD far/RB from/IN crispy/NN -/NN even/RB for/IN just/RB the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN ./.
The/DT spicy/NN chicken/NN was/VBD not/RB spicy/JJ at/IN all/DT and/CC the/DT sauce/JJ overall/JJ tasted/VBN more/JJR like/IN ketchup/NN than/IN anything/NN else/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO having/VB some/DT decent/JJ Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN but/CC was/VBD disappointed/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP always/RB been/VBN an/DT avid/JJ fried/JJ chicken/NN lover/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP knew/VBD I/PRP had/VBD to/TO check/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN !/.
Their/NNP interior/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB simple/JJ but/CC nice/JJ ,/, with/IN Kpop/NNP playing/NNP in/IN the/DT background/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN 2/CD friends/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP ordered/VBP fried/VBN chicken/NN (/NNS obviously/RB )/VBP -/JJ and/CC chose/VB the/DT half/NN marinated/VBD ,/, half/DT soy/JJ garlic/NN boneless/NN option/NN ,/, and/CC also/RB ordered/VBD a/DT side/NN of/IN mozzarella/NN sticks/NNS ./.
I/PRP really/VBP enjoyed/VBN the/DT soy/JJ garlic/NN chicken/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP love/VBP how/WRB the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD n't/RB overfried/VBN ./.
The/DT mozzarella/NN sticks/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ as/IN well/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB that/IN 6/JJ sticks/NNS were/VBD worth/VBN 5/JJ dollars/NNS )/NN :/: They/PRP are/VBP a/DT bit/JJ limited/NN in/IN other/JJ food/NN options/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP serve/VBP the/DT best/JJS Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN in/IN downtown/NN montreal/NN !/.
I/PRP love/VBP everything/VBG about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
My/NNP friends/NNS and/CC I/PRP affectionately/RB refer/VBP to/TO it/PRP as/IN ``/`` le/NN Ballsack/NNP ''/'' ,/, but/CC do/VBP n't/RB let/VB that/DT put/NN you/PRP off/RB ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP silly/RB and/CC this/DT place/NN really/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./.
From/NNP the/DT 60/NN 's/POS retro/NN styling/NN to/TO the/DT psychedelic/NN ,/, epilepsy/JJ inducing/VBG k/NN pop/NN playing/NN on/IN TV/NN ,/, Basak/NNP effervesces/NNPS Koreanness/NNP ./.
No/DT detail/NN is/VBZ spared/VBN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD notice/RB there/EX 's/VBZ electronic/JJ bells/NNS on/IN each/DT table/JJ ,/, a/DT staple/NN of/IN restaurant/JJ dining/NN in/IN South/NNP Korea/NNP and/CC Japan/NNP ./.
The/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ solid/JJ ./.
Tasty/NN and/CC not/RB too/RB salty/JJ ./.
The/DT spicy/NN fried/VBD chicken/NN is/VBZ mixed/VBN with/IN some/DT kinda/NN delicious/JJ mochi/NN that/WDT 's/POS coated/VBN with/IN delicious/JJ spicy/NN sauce/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ excellent/JJ ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ cheap/NN and/CC delicious/JJ ,/, it/PRP also/RB goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN fried/JJ chicken/NN ./.
Verdict/NN :/: Second/NNP best/NNP Korean/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN in/IN Montreal/NNP ./.
Best/NNP I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN the/DT downtown/NN core/NN ./.

The/DT soy/JJ garlic/NN chicken/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
