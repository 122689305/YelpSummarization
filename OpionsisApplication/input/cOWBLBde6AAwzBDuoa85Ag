So/IN I/PRP went/VBD to/TO a/DT new/JJ place/NN ,/, it/PRP had/VBD high/JJ reviews/NNS and/CC I/PRP got/VBD a/DT new/JJ set/NN and/CC a/DT gel/NN pedicure/NN !/.
Everyone/NNP was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC all/DT looked/VBN okay/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD so/RB SLOW/JJ I/PRP was/VBD there/RB 5/JJ HOURS/NNP !/.
!/IN .../: I/PRP could/MD n't/RB imagine/VB ever/RB going/VBG back/RB there/RB again/RB ,/, they/PRP were/VBD closed/VBN for/IN over/IN an/DT hour/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD still/RB in/IN there/RB ,/, the/DT ONLY/NNP 1/CD in/IN there/EX !/VBZ .../: ..Not/NN fun/NN !/.
So/IN I/PRP was/VBD stressed/VBN after/IN that/DT ,/, and/CC knew/VBD I/PRP needed/VBD to/TO find/VB a/DT new/JJ place/NN so/IN now/RB I/PRP am/VBP in/IN the/DT present/JJ time/NN ,/, and/CC brings/NNS me/PRP to/TO my/VB review/NN here/RB today/NN ./.
I/PRP took/VBD my/JJ time/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN 2/CD weeks/NNS ,/, I/PRP really/RB did/VBD my/PRP$ homework/NN ./.
I/PRP researched/VBD ,/, googled/VBN ./.
read/IN reviews/NNS ,/, and/CC finally/RB decided/VBD on/IN where/WRB I/PRP would/MD go/VB ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP Fancy/NNP Nails/NNP &/CC Spa/NNP on/IN Cave/NNP Creek/NNP Rd/NNP in/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB just/RB make/VB an/DT appointment/NN either/NN ./.
After/IN I/PRP was/VBD done/VBN with/IN all/DT my/JJ research/NN ,/, I/PRP called/VBD about/IN 4/CD of/IN the/DT salons/NNS ,/, and/CC went/VBD in/IN person/NN ,/, to/TO see/VB the/DT salons/NNS ,/, and/CC speak/NN to/TO them/PRP ,/, as/RB well/RB ,/, as/IN look/NN at/IN there/EX selections/NNS of/IN powders/NNS //VBG colors/NNS ./.
When/WRB I/PRP first/RB called/VBD Fancy/NNP nails/VBZ I/PRP spoke/VBP to/TO the/DT Owner/NNP David/NNP ,/, he/PRP was/VBD very/RB friendly/RB ./.
He/PRP offered/VBD for/IN me/PRP to/TO come/VB in/IN ,/, and/CC take/VB a/DT look/NN ,/, and/CC told/VBD me/PRP they/PRP would/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN me/PRP ,/, When/WRB I/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT shop/NN ,/, again/RB he/PRP was/VBD friendly/RB ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO make/VB an/DT appointment/NN ./.
For/IN a/DT new/JJ set/NN and/CC gel/NN pedicure/NN with/IN Kim/NNP also/RB eye/VBD brow/JJ wax/NN ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB the/DT chunky/confetti/NN powder/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP used/JJ to/TO ,/, but/CC assured/VBD me/PRP they/PRP could/MD order/VB at/IN a/DT later/JJ time.My/NN nails/NNS seemed/VBD okay/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD just/RB glad/JJ to/TO have/VB them/PRP done/RB ,/, and/CC have/VBP found/VBN a/DT place/NN ,/, that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB pay/VB to/TO close/JJ attention.As/NNS the/DT holidays/NNS were/VBD fast/VBN approaching/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD very/RB busy/JJ at/IN that/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT gel/NN pedicure/NN was/VBD good/JJ looked/JJ nice/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN disapointed/VBD that/IN my/NN ,/, toe/NN nails/NNS were/VBD grown/VBN out/RP so/RB quickly/RB ,/, as/IN I/PRP had/VBD said/VBN please/NN make/VBP them/PRP extra/JJ short/NN ,/, I/PRP like/VBP them/PRP short/JJ ./.
And/CC even/RB after/IN she/PRP first/RB cut/VBD them/PRP ,/, I/PRP asked/VBD her/PRP to/TO trim/VB off/RP more/JJR ,/, glad/JJ I/PRP did/VBD ,/, because/IN they/PRP were/VBD still/RB to/TO long/RB ./.
I/PRP figured/VBD though/IN it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ time/NN ,/, so/RB next/JJ time/NN it/PRP will/MD be/VB better/RBR ./.
I/PRP always/VBP got/VBN compliments/NNS on/IN my/PRP$ nails/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT last/JJ 10/CD years/NNS ./.
Well/NNP all/DT of/IN a/DT sudden/NN no/DT one/NN is/VBZ complimenting/VBG me/PRP ?/. !/.
I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN is/VBZ really/RB strange/JJ ?/. !/.
After/IN a/DT couple/NN days/NNS I/PRP looked/VBD harder/JJ at/IN my/PRP$ nails/NNS and/CC I/PRP could/MD see/VB every/DT little/NN mark/NN under/IN the/DT pink/NN area/NN ?/NN .../: and/CC it/PRP looked/VBD weird/JJ .../: .they/JJ never/RB looked/VBN like/IN that/DT before/NN ./.
./.
I/PRP had/VBD them/PRP use/VBP medium/NN pink/NN ,/, same/JJ thing/NN I/PRP had/VBD always/RB used/VBN ,/, for/IN 10/CD years/NNS ./.
Then/RB still/RB no/DT compliments/NNS ,/, and/CC each/DT day/NN they/PRP looked/VBD worse/JJ .../: it/PRP was/VBD like/IN you/PRP could/MD see/VB all/PDT the/DT drill/JJ marks/NNS straight/RB through/IN it/PRP ,/, on/IN my/PRP$ nail/NN beds/NNS ./.
I/PRP went/VBD back/RB to/TO my/VB next/JJ appointment/NN because/IN now/RB new/JJ years/NNS Eve/NN was/VBD here/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT party/NN to/TO go/VB to/TO ./.
This/DT time/NN the/DT same/JJ thing/NN happened/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ nails/NNS ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ pedicure/NN also/RB ./.
Now/RB my/JJ daughter/NN is/VBZ asking/VBG me/PRP whats/VBZ wrong/JJ with/IN my/PRP$ nails/NNS ?/VBP .../: And/CC even/RB my/JJ husband/NN !/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB look/VB nice/JJ anymore/NN ,/, my/NNP husband/NN says/VBZ ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO cry/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP called/VBP the/DT nail/NN salon/NN and/CC spoke/NN to/TO David/VB the/DT owner/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD come/NN in/IN and/CC he/PRP would/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN me/PRP himself/PRP ./.
So/IN I/PRP did/VBD ,/, and/CC he/PRP said/VBD they/PRP needed/VBD to/TO be/VB removed/VBN ,/, and/CC cleaned/VBD up/RP underneath/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT whole/JJ new/JJ set/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP would/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN me/PRP ,/, and/CC he/PRP did/VBD !/VB .../:
:/: )/JJ So/NNS now/RB everything/NN will/MD be/VB okay..right/JJ ?/.
wrong/JJ !/NNS !/VBP .../: ./.
It/PRP helped/VBD ,/, But/CC he/PRP had/VBD to/TO drill/JJ my/NN nail/NN beds/VBZ way/NN way/NN down/IN a/DT lot/NN and/CC it/PRP hurt/-NONE- real/JJ real/NN bad/NN to/TO do/VB that/IN !/NN .../: I/PRP had/VBD another/VBN pedicure/NN by/IN a/DT different/JJ tech/NN ,/, once/RB again/RB I/PRP explained/VBD they/PRP were/VBD left/VBN to/TO long/RB 2/CD times/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP like/VBP them/PRP extra/JJ short/NN ,/, make/VBP them/PRP very/RB short/JJ ./.
They/PRP said/VBD yes/NNS but/CC ,/, they/PRP did/VBD not/RB ./.
After/IN 2/CD weeks/NNS (/JJ and/CC still/RB no/DT compliments/NNS )/IN I/PRP was/VBD beside/JJ myself/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP made/VBD my/JJ appointment/NN with/IN David/NNP again/NNP ,/, thinking/VBG Id/NNP try/NNP one/CD more/RBR time/NN ./.
And/CC when/WRB I/PRP got/VBD there/RB I/PRP showed/VBD him/PRP all/PDT the/DT drill/JJ marks/NNS on/IN my/PRP$ nail/NN beds/NNS ./.
He/PRP then/RB showed/VBD his/PRP$ daughter/NN Hannah/NNP ,/, and/CC had/VBD her/PRP do/VBP my/RB nails.She/VB said/VBD would/MD do/VB back/RB //VB fill/NN and/CC use/NN ``/`` her/PRP ''/'' medium/NN pink/NN powder/NN ./.
and/CC it/PRP will/MD cover/VB all/DT those/DT marks/NNS ./.
She/PRP then/RB proceeded/VBD ,/, without/IN saying/NN anything/NN to/TO literally/RB rip/VB off/RP my/PRP$ finger/NN nail/NN ,/, it/PRP hurt/VBD !/NN ./.
I/PRP pulled/VBD away/RB ,/, in/IN pain/NN ,/, and/CC said/VBD ,/, no/DT !/NN
you/PRP need/VBP to/TO soak/VB them/PRP off/IN !/NN ..and/IN she/PRP laughed/VBD !/NNP !/.
and/CC said/VBD I/PRP was/VBD sensitive/JJ and/CC begin/JJ to/TO rip/NN again/RB !/JJ .OMG/NNP !/NNP I/PRP couldnt/VBP believe/JJ it/PRP now/RB there/EX was/VBD BLOOD/NNP !/.
and/CC a/DT huge/JJ throbbing/VBG pain/NN she/PRP laughed/VBD again/RB !/.
I/PRP had/VBD tears/NNS It/PRP hurt/-NONE- for/IN the/DT whole/JJ time/NN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD not/RB even/RB sorry.When/VB she/PRP was/VBD finally/RB finished/RB ,/, They/PRP looked/VBD good/JJ ,/, so/RB I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP might/MD be/VB Okay/NNP Well/NNP wrong/NNP again/NNP !/.
2/CD days/NNS later/JJ 1/CD nail/NN was/VBD lifting/VBG !/NN ..I/NNP called/NNP Hannah.Can/NNP she/PRP please/VB fix/NN it/PRP ?/.
She/PRP said/VBD to/TO busy/NN !/.

I/PRP got/VBD really/RB upset/JJ ./.
Then/RB she/PRP said/VBD ok/JJ come/NNS in.The/VBP owner/NN David/NNP looked/VBD at/IN it/PRP ,/, he/PRP fixed/VBZ it/PRP ,/, and/CC never/RB said/VBD 1/CD word/NN to/TO me/VB the/DT whole/JJ time.I/NN knew/NN right/RB then/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB returning/VBG ./.
Next/NNP day/VBD another/DT nail/NN lifted/VBD and/CC came/VBD off/RP 1/CD by/IN 1/CD til/JJ all/NNS are/VBP gone/JJ just/RB shy/JJ of/IN 12/CD days/NNS !/.
OMG/NNP
I/PRP was/VBD looking/VBG for/IN a/DT nail/NN parlor/NN that/WDT was/VBD close-ish/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ area/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT place/NN by/IN far/RB had/VBD the/DT best/NN and/CC most/RBS consistent/JJ reviews/NNS ./.
Called/JJ to/TO make/VB an/DT appointment/NN to/TO do/VB my/PRP$ gel/NN nails/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT man/NN on/IN the/DT phone/NN was/VBD very/RB clear/JJ about/IN directions/NNS ./.
Upon/NNP arriving/VBG there/RB i/JJ can/MD absolutely/RB see/VB why/JJ people/NNS might/MD get/VB lost/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP tucked/VBN into/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN a/DT complex/NN on/IN Rose/NNP Garden/NNP lane/NN ./.
Easiest/NNP way/NN to/TO get/VB there/RB would/MD be/VB to/TO turn/NN and/CC go/VB east/RB onto/JJ Rose/NNP Garden/NNP lane/NN and/CC then/RB turn/VB left/JJ (/NNS north/JJ )/NNS into/IN the/DT red/VBN brick/NN complex/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP straight/JJ ahead/NN of/IN you/PRP there/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ new/JJ place/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD pretty/RB busy/JJ when/WRB I/PRP got/VBD there/RB ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD 1000/CD on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP and/CC they/PRP had/VBD only/RB opened/VBN at/IN 0900/CD ./.
Most/JJ people/NNS were/VBD actually/RB there/RB for/IN pedis/NNS ./.
Since/IN I/PRP had/VBD an/DT appointment/NN I/PRP was/VBD seated/VBN almost/RB right/JJ away/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP got/VBD down/RB to/TO removing/VBG my/PRP$ previous/JJ gel/NN manicure/NN and/CC get/VB a/DT new/JJ one/CD on/IN me/PRP ./.
I/PRP do/VBP have/VBP to/TO make/VB a/DT disclaimer-/JJ I/PRP had/VBD n't/RB always/RB had/VBD a/DT great/JJ experience/NN with/IN gel/JJ nails/NNS ./.
I/PRP did/VBD them/PRP for/IN my/NN wedding/NN and/CC loved/VBD them/PRP ,/, and/CC went/VBD back/RP to/TO get/VB them/PRP done/VB after/IN they/PRP grew/VBD out/RP ,/, for/IN a/DT bachelorette/NN party/NN in/IN Vegas/NNP ./.
The/DT removal/NN process/NN was/VBD horrid-/JJ they/PRP used/VBP this/DT thing/NN to/TO scrape/VB the/DT stuff/NN off/NN and/CC it/PRP felt/VBD awful/JJ ./.
And/CC then/RB I/PRP left/VBP ,/, went/VBD shopping/JJ and/CC literally/RB in/IN an/DT HOUR/NNP had/VBD a/DT giant/JJ chip/NN ./.
Of/IN course/NN there/EX was/VBD no/DT time/NN to/TO go/VB back/RB and/CC get/VB it/PRP fixed/-NONE- ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB disappointing/JJ experience/NN ./.
But/CC getting/VBG mine/NN done/NN when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD out/IN of/IN town/NN had/VBD been/VBN pleasant/JJ ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ best/NN friend/NN said/VBD she/PRP was/VBD addicted/VBN to/TO them/PRP ./.
So/IN I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT shot/NN again/RB ./.
And/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ I/PRP did/VBD ./.
The/DT removal/NN process/NN here/RB was/VBD quick/JJ and/CC painless-/JJ the/DT gel/NN manicure/NN crumbled/VBD off/RP when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD time/NN to/TO scrape/VB it/PRP off/-NONE- ,/, no/DT awful/JJ sensations/NNS necessary/JJ ./.
They/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ range/NN of/IN colors/NNS ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ lady/NN even/RB tried/VBD to/TO recommend/VB another/DT color/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
(/IN I/PRP wound/VBP up/RP sticking/NN with/IN the/DT color/NN I/PRP wanted/VBD )/NN ./.
The/DT nails/NNS were/VBD beautifully/RB done/JJ ,/, and/CC she/PRP did/VBD them/PRP promptly-/JJ I/PRP was/VBD in/IN and/CC out/IN of/IN the/DT place/NN in/IN under/IN an/DT hour/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD decide/VB to/TO wait/VB about/IN a/DT week/NN to/TO do/VB a/DT review/NN ,/, to/TO see/VB how/WRB well/RB these/DT puppies/NNS wear/JJ ./.
The/DT manicure/NN I/PRP had/VBD prior/RB to/TO this/DT chipped/VBD a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT thumbs/NNS within/IN a/DT week/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD also/RB a/DT bit/JJ disappointing/NN ./.
A/DT week/NN and/CC these/DT nails/NNS look/VBP as/RB good/JJ as/IN they/PRP did/VBD when/WRB I/PRP left/VBP the/DT salon/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP hard/RB on/IN my/PRP$ nails/NNS too-/JJ I/PRP pound/VBP at/IN a/DT keyboard/NN ,/, and/CC have/VBP two/CD big/JJ ,/, rough/JJ dogs/NNS at/IN home/NN ./.
