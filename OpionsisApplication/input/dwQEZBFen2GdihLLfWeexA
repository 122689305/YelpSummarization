If/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT hankering/NN for/IN Mexican/NNP ,/, head/NN on/IN over/NN to/TO don/VB tequilas/NNS ./.
Fast/NNP service/NN and/CC delicious/JJ food/NN with/IN generous/JJ portions/NNS ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Guadalajara/NNP special/NNP tamale/NN and/CC the/DT pollo/NN adobe/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD both/DT delicious/JJ ./.
Kind/NNP of/IN disappointed/JJ with/IN the/DT previous/JJ reviews/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN customer/NN service/NN because/IN honestly/RB there/EX was/VBD none/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/JJ patrons/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC the/DT waiter/NN seemed/VBD inconvenienced/VBN by/IN us/PRP being/VBG there/RB ./.
After/IN he/PRP took/VBD our/NN order/NN he/PRP went/VBD and/CC sat/JJ down/NNS in/IN another/DT booth/NN and/CC started/VBD playing/NN on/IN a/DT computer/NN ./.
We/PRP did/VBD not/RB get/VB our/PRP$ food/NN quickly/RB like/IN everyone/NN else/NN has/VBZ said/VBN ,/, as/IN we/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/JJ people/NNS here/RB it/PRP should/MD n't/RB take/VB as/RB long/JJ as/IN it/PRP takes/VBZ for/IN me/PRP to/TO finish/VB my/PRP$ beverage/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP had/VBD something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT waiter/NN was/VBD farting/VBG around/IN instead/RB of/IN doing/VBG his/PRP$ job/NN ?/.
They/PRP got/VBD three/CD stars/NNS because/IN despite/IN the/DT service/NN the/DT food/NN was/VBD AMAZING/NNP and/CC quite/JJ inexpensive/JJ ./.
If/IN you/PRP order/VBP a/DT quesadilla/NN you/PRP may/MD want/VB to/TO order/VB a/DT la/NN carte/NN items/NNS as/RB well/RB because/IN the/DT quesadilla/NN was/VBD the/DT size/NN of/IN a/DT large/JJ Taco/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ odd/JJ ./.
I/PRP eat/VBP here/RB all/PDT the/DT time/NN and/CC most/JJS of/IN the/DT staff/NN are/VBP from/IN Guadalajara/NNP .../: ./. Food/NNP is/VBZ definately/RB ``/`` americanized/VBN ''/'' and/CC by/IN that/DT i/NNP mean/NNP tamed/VBD down/RP in/IN heat/NN and/CC changed/VBD a/DT little/JJ for/IN what/WP americans/NNS expect/VBP .../: ./.
But/CC when/WRB i/JJ order/NN my/NN racos/VBZ de/IN carne/NN asada/NN with/IN lime/NN and/CC cilantro/NN and/CC onions/NNS .../: ./. All/DT i/NN get/NNS are/VBP big/JJ smiles/NNS and/CC HOT/NNP sauce/NN .../: ./.

Why/IN many/JJ people/NNS I/PRP know/VBP ,/, including/VBG my/NN wife/NN like/IN to/TO go/VB to/TO this/DT place/NN is/VBZ beyond/IN me/PRP ./.
Very/NNP good/NNP ,/, reasonable/JJ priced/NN ./.
The/DT Texas/NNP quesadilla/NN with/IN chicken/NN ,/, Steak/NNP ,/, shrimp/NN ,/, onion/NN ,/, peppers/NNS and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD large/JJ and/CC very/RB good/JJ They/PRP have/VBP Dos/VBN Equis/NNP on/IN draft/NN !/.

Amazingly/RB good/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN but/CC they/PRP rip/VBP you/PRP off/RP EVERY/NNP time/NN ./.
They/PRP scratch/VBP your/VBN order/NN on/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN paper/NN with/IN no/DT descriptions/NNS and/CC prices/NNS never/RB add/VBD up/RB ./.
Its/PRP$ ALWAYS/NNP more/RBR ./.
We/PRP have/VBP checked/VBN this/DT several/JJ tines/NNS and/CC wrote/VBD down/RP everything/NN we/PRP ordered/VBP and/CC the/DT prices/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC its/PRP$ been/JJ 20-30/CD %/NN higher/JJR consistently/RB every/DT time/NN ./.

Write/NNP down/VBD everything/NN you/PRP order/NN and/CC be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO question/VB your/PRP$ bill/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ,/, the/DT salsa/NN flavorful/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
They/PRP only/RB serve/VBP pre/JJ mixed/NN margaritas/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ no/DT bueno/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT burrito/NN fajita/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT kids/NN nachos/NNS were/VBD bland/NN and/CC rubbery/NN ./.
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN to/TO celebrate/VB my/PRP$ birthday/NN ./.

We/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN here/RB 2-3/CD times/NNS a/DT month/NN for/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ my/JJ absolute/NN favorite/JJ Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB had/VBD a/DT meal/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/IN !/.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ so/RB huge/JJ and/CC full/JJ of/IN options/NNS ,/, even/RB your/IN pickiest/NN eaters/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO find/VB something/NN they/PRP can/MD enjoy/VB ./.

The/DT portions/NNS are/VBP always/RB great/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT staff/NN treats/NNS us/PRP like/IN family/NN each/DT time/NN we/PRP stop/VBP in/IN !/NN
We/PRP have/VBP just/RB moved/VBN from/IN Austin/NNP ,/, TX/NNP to/TO NE/NNP Ohio/NNP and/CC are/VBP searching/VBG for/IN our/PRP$ new/JJ favorite/JJ Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN promptly/RB and/CC brought/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
The/DT chips/NNS were/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC warm/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ blander/NN than/IN we/PRP care/VBP for/IN ./.
Service/NNP seemed/VBD slow/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN all/DT fairness/NN it/PRP was/VBD Saturday/NNP evening/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Lobster/NNP Enchiladas/NNP which/WDT had/VBD pieces/NNS of/IN lobster/NN saut√©ed/VBD with/IN onion/NN and/CC tomato/NN wrapped/VBD in/IN a/DT fresh/JJ corn/NN tortilla/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD average/JJ ./.
My/NNP husband/NN had/VBD the/DT Burrito/NNP Especial/NNP with/IN a/DT chicken/VBN burrito/NN and/CC a/DT beef/NN tip/NN burrito/NN ./.
Hubby/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD above/VBN average/JJ ./.
The/DT rice/NN had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ flavor/NN with/IN an/DT aftertaste/NN of/IN tomato/NN and/CC cilantro/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD disappointed/VBN with/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN complex/JJ flavor/NN profiles/VBZ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP become/VBN accustomed/JJ to/TO while/IN living/NN in/IN the/DT Southwest/NNP ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, we/PRP rated/VBD it/PRP as/IN adequate/JJ to/TO good/JJ ./.
Maybe/NNP let/NNP 's/POS work/NN on/IN the/DT chili/NN rolenos/NNS ./.
Do/NNP nice/NNP large/JJ poblemo/NN peppers/NNS like/IN el/JJ rancho/NN and/CC you/PRP got/VBD me/PRP as/IN a/DT frequent/JJ customer/NN ./.
A+/NNP on/IN the/DT guacamole/NN !/.
Large/NNP portion/NN ./.
Nice/NNP !/.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ n't/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC every/DT time/NN I/PRP come/VBP here/RB with/IN friends/NNS they/PRP overcharge/VBP us/PRP ./.
We/PRP end/VBD up/RP getting/VBG charged/VBN at/IN least/JJS a/DT few/JJ dollars/NNS more/JJR than/IN our/PRP$ menu/NN items/NNS should/MD be/VB when/WRB we/PRP check/VBP out/RP ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ happened/VBN on/IN several/JJ different/JJ occasions/NNS ./.
Though/IN the/DT food/NN may/MD have/VB been/VBN good/JJ and/CC reasonably/RB priced/VBN (/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, not/RB on/IN the/DT bill/NN )/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD unfortunately/RB never/RB be/VB going/VBG back/RB ./.
Very/NNP disappointing/NN ./.
First/NNP time/NNP I/PRP eat/VBP here/RB I/PRP came/VBD with/IN friends/NNS who/WP told/-NONE- me/VBP the/DT food/NN was/VBD the/DT most/RBS authentic/JJ Mexican/JJ food/NN they/PRP ever/RB had/VBD ,/, well/RB it/PRP was/VBD not/RB for/IN me/PRP since/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB really/RB Mexican/JJ but/CC Tex/NNP Mex/NNP really/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ but/CC nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN either/CD ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT pi√±a/NN colada/NN and/CC the/DT waiter/NN spill/NN it/PRP over/IN me/PRP without/IN replacing/NN it/PRP not/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT place/NN tries/VBZ so/RB hard/JJ to/TO be/VB unique/JJ and/CC as/RB Mexican/JJ as/IN can/MD be/VB but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT caricature/NN and/CC a/DT stereotype/NN of/IN anything/NN Mexican/NNP honestly/RB I/PRP was/VBD waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT three/CD amigos/NNS to/TO come/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT bathroom/NN or/CC something/NN I/PRP despise/VBP decoration/NN like/IN this/DT and/CC it/PRP affected/VBD the/DT overall/JJ rating/NN ./.
Second/NNP time/NN there/EX food/NN was/VBD not/RB as/IN good/JJ I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT dish/JJ that/IN included/JJ carnitas/NNS in/IN it/PRP but/CC they/PRP were/VBD missing/VBG I/PRP told/VBD my/RB waiter/JJR he/PRP apologized/VBD brought/VB them/PRP in/IN told/NN me/IN he/PRP was/VBD sorry/JJ but/CC he/PRP charged/VBD me/PRP for/IN them/PRP anyways/RB even/RB though/IN they/PRP were/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB included/VBN ./.
Not/RB as/RB bad/JJ as/IN others/NNS but/CC not/RB great/JJ by/IN any/DT means/NN ./.
Amazing/VBG Mexican/NNP place/NN !/NN !/.
Very/NNP tasty/NN and/CC reasonably/RB priced/RB ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP Molacajete/NNP ,/, seafood/NN chimi/NN and/CC carne/NN asada/NN burrito/NN ./.
The/DT best/JJS !/NN !/.
Molacajete/NNP is/VBZ a/DT must/NN try/NN !/.
This/DT is/VBZ something/NN new/JJ I/PRP have/VBP never/RB tried/VBN before/IN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ quick/JJ !/.
Cute/NNP authentic/JJ decor/NN ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ texmex/NN and/CC very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP they/PRP offered/VBD black/JJ beans/NNS ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP from/IN California/NNP where/WRB black/JJ beans/NNS are/VBP popular/JJ ./.
Margaritas/NNP are/VBP great/JJ ,/, I/PRP got/VBD a/DT buzz/NN from/IN two/CD ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD busy/NN ./.
Mexican/NNP families/NNS were/VBD here/RB and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ a/DT plus/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP noticed/VBD here/RB was/VBD the/DT decor/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB I/PRP liked/VBD ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, yes/NNS ,/, I/PRP enjoy/VBP lime/JJ green/JJ walls/NNS and/CC bright/JJ pink/NN color/NN washes/NNS ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ just/RB me/PRP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD three/CD little/JJ ones/NNS with/IN us/PRP ,/, so/IN you/PRP can/MD imagine/VB that/IN we/PRP were/VBD a/DT little/JJ less/JJR than/IN organized/JJ ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ server/NN took/VBD it/PRP all/DT in/IN stride/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP appreciated/VBD ./.
He/PRP was/VBD also/RB super/JJ fast/NN ;/: I/PRP think/VBP all/DT of/IN us/PRP were/VBD surprised/VBN how/WRB quickly/RB our/PRP$ meals/NNS came/VBD out/RP ./.
As/IN for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ difficult/NN to/TO review/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD never/RB been/VBN here/RB before/IN and/CC my/PRP$ Mexican/NNP palate/NN is/VBZ less-than-sophisticated/JJ ,/, so/RB I/PRP randomly/RB ordered/VBD a/DT plain/NN enchilada/NN and/CC quesadilla/NN ./.
The/DT latter/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, though/IN I/PRP found/VBD the/DT enchilada/NN a/DT little/JJ perplexing/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD hiding/VBG under/IN the/DT sauce/NN and/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB really/RB tell/JJ what/NN was/VBD in/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT chips/NNS and/CC salsa/NN were/VBD great/JJ ,/, though/IN ./.
And/CC hot/NN ./.
The/DT one/CD person/NN at/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ who/WP can/MD apparently/RB drink/VB tabasco/NN sauce/NN straight/NN even/RB admitted/VBD his/PRP$ eyes/NNS were/VBD watering/VBG a/DT little/JJ ./.
Everyone/NNP else/RB seemed/VBD to/TO really/RB enjoy/VB their/PRP$ meals/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB in/IN Ohio/NNP much/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'd/MD happily/RB go/VB back/RB and/CC try/RB something/NN else/RB ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC um/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB exactly/VB object/NN to/TO painting/VBG my/PRP$ living/NN room/NN lime/NN green/NN ,/, after/IN seeing/JJ how/WRB cool/JJ it/PRP looked/VBD at/IN Don/NNP 's/POS ./.
With/IN everywhere/RB else/RB packed/VBN on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ,/, we/PRP wondered/VBD in/IN ,/, not/RB expecting/VBG much/RB quite/RB honestly/RB ./.
We/PRP both/VBP ordered/VBN off/RP the/DT specials/NNS menu/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ husband/NN barely/RB managed/VBD to/TO squeeze/VB in/IN his/PRP$ standard/JJ 'where/NN 's/POS my/NN burrito/NN '/POS before/IN two/CD large/JJ plates/NNS ,/, overflowing/VBG with/IN food/NN ,/, arrived/VBD in/IN front/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.
The/DT food/NN itself/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Mexican/JJ food/NN can/MD too/RB easily/RB be/VB greasy/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT was/VBD not/RB ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN startling/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT classic/JJ mexican/JJ dishes/NNS were/VBD all/DT on/IN the/DT mark/NN ./.
And/CC there/EX was/VBD enough/RB left/VBN over/RP for/IN a/DT second/JJ meal/NN tomorrow/NN ./.
Prices/NNS were/VBD very/RB reasonable/JJ -/JJ our/NN total/NN bill/NN ,/, including/VBG tips/NNS ,/, was/VBD less/JJR than/IN $/$ 25/CD ./.
Definitely/RB planning/VBG another/DT visit/NN ./.
i/NN do/VBP n't/RB understand/VB all/DT of/IN the/DT high/JJ marks/NNS for/IN the/DT this/DT place/NN ./.
the/DT chips/NNS were/VBD not/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT salsa/NN was/VBD n't/RB good/JJ either../NN the/DT chips/NNS were/VBD bland/NN ,/, old/JJ and/CC not/RB seasoned/VBD at/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT salsa/NN represented/VBD canned/VBN tomato/NN taste/NN ,/, yuk/NN ,/, the/DT chix/NN enchilada/NN was/VBD flavorless/JJ ,/, while/IN using/VBG white/JJ meat/NN chicken/NN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB seasoned/VBN and/CC very/RB chewy/JJ ,/, it/PRP had/VBD no/DT flavor/NN whatsoever/NN and/CC was/VBD definitely/RB something/NN ``/`` not/RB ''/'' to/TO order/NN ./.
the/DT most/RBS off/JJ putting/VBG thing/NN about/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ the/DT filthiness/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT furniture/NN and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD fruit/VBN flies/NNS buzzing/VBG our/PRP$ table/JJ thru/NN out/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
while/IN el/JJ rodeo/NN and/CC el/NN patron/NN are/VBP nearby/JJ ,/, and/CC have/VBP far/VBN better/JJ food/NN ,/, i/NNP cant/NN understand/NN what/WP the/DT attraction/NN is/VBZ to/TO this/DT place/NN ,/, will/MD not/RB be/VB back/RB
On/IN a/DT recent/JJ trip/NN to/TO Kirtland/NNP ,/, OH/NNP ./.

Friendly/RB waitress/NN who/WP gave/-NONE- good/VBD tips/NNS from/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
We/PRP both/VBP had/VBD the/DT Tres/NNPS Amigos/NNP ./.

I/PRP went/VBD with/IN a/DT friend/NN of/IN mine/NN from/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, who/WP was/VBD treated/VBN like/IN a/DT rock/NN star/NN when/WRB he/PRP arrived/VBD (/RB well/RB ,/, he/PRP IS/VBD a/DT rock/NN star/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ indicative/JJ of/IN the/DT casual/JJ and/CC familial/JJ vibe/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB take/VB notes/NNS -/JJ too/RB busy/JJ enjoying/VBG the/DT company/NN -/NN but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP pretty/RB sure/JJ I/PRP got/VBD a/DT burrito/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
