I/PRP sat/VBP at/IN a/DT little/JJ table/NN in/IN a/DT corner/NN ./.
Waitress/NNP took/VBD my/NN order/NN ./.
Because/IN the/DT tables/NNS are/VBP so/RB close/JJ to/TO one/CD another/NN and/CC filled/VBD ,/, I/PRP could/MD n't/RB go/VB to/TO the/DT Salsa/NNP bar/NN to/TO try/VB a/DT few/JJ sauces/NNS ./.

When/WRB I/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD chicken/VBN tacos/NNS ,/, I/PRP expected/VBP two/CD nice/JJ size/NN tacos/NNS ./.

Only/IN reason/NN I/PRP tried/VBD this/DT place/NN was/VBD because/IN of/IN all/PDT the/DT reviews/NNS ./.

Awesome/NNP salsa/NNP bar/NN !/.
The/DT guacamole/NN is/VBZ different/JJ but/CC awesome/JJ !/.
The/DT street/NN tacos/VBZ with/IN great/JJ too/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB coming/VBG back/RB to/TO try/VB more/JJR stuff/NN !/.
Food/NNP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB what/WP I/PRP expected/VBP as/IN they/PRP use/VBP different/JJ ingredients/NNS together/RB (/VBP like/IN pecans/NNS in/IN the/DT sangria/NN or/CC cranberries/NNS and/CC mango/NN in/IN the/DT guacamole/JJ )/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC home/NN made/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN lacking/VBG slightly/NN was/VBD the/DT service/NN ./.
They/PRP got/VBD a/DT few/JJ things/NNS wrong/JJ ,/, took/VBD awhile/JJ ,/, and/CC was/VBD a/DT little/JJ slow/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP definitely/RB would/MD n't/RB stop/VB me/PRP from/IN going/VBG back/NNS ./.
Menu/NNP is/VBZ very/RB extensive/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD customize/VB ./.
Pros/NNS :/: Full/NNP bar/NN ,/, salsa/NN bar/NN Cons/NNS :/: No/JJ bartender/NN ,/, watery/NN salsas/NNS ,/, poor/JJ service/NN ./.
We/PRP visited/VBD this/DT shop/NN for/IN a/DT weekend/JJ lunch/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD starving/VBG and/CC did/VBD n't/RB have/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP opted/VBD to/TO quickly/RB sit/VB at/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD 5/CD minutes/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT server/NN brought/NN us/PRP chips/NNS ./.
We/PRP then/RB went/VBD and/CC picked/VBD out/RP a/DT few/JJ salsas/NNS from/IN the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
Out/IN of/IN the/DT 4/NN salsas/VBZ I/PRP tried/VBP ,/, I/PRP liked/VBD none/NN of/IN them/PRP ./.
They/PRP were/VBD very/RB thin/JJ and/CC watery/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT plastic/JJ containers/NNS are/VBP smaller/JJR than/IN the/DT chips/NNS -/JJ so/IN you/PRP can/MD only/RB dip/VB the/DT corner/NN of/IN a/DT chip/NN (/NN but/CC the/DT salsa/NN wo/MD n't/RB stick/VB )/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB pour/VB the/DT salsa/NN onto/NN a/DT chip/NN (/NN because/IN it/PRP will/MD run/VB off/RP )/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ chips/NNS that/IN sort/NN of/IN work/NN are/VBP the/DT 'defective/JJ '/NN folded/VBN ones/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN why/WRB everyone/NN raves/VBZ about/IN the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ,/, perhaps/RB for/IN the/DT novelty/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC chips/NNS do/VBP n't/RB work/VB as/IN a/DT salsa-delivery/JJ vehicle/NN for/IN watery/NN salsa/NN ./.
After/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS ,/, we/PRP still/RB did/VBD not/RB have/VB water/NN ,/, and/CC 15/CD minutes/NNS into/IN us/PRP sitting/VBG there/RB ,/, we/PRP apologized/VBD and/CC left/NN ./.
Their/NNP tacos/NNS may/MD well/RB be/VB amazing/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB time/VBN to/TO sit/VB around/IN ./.
Waiting/VBG for/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS (/IN literally/RB )/VBN with/IN no/DT water/NN delivery/NN during/IN an/DT AZ/NNP summer/NN should/MD be/VB criminal/JJ ./.
There/EX appeared/VBD to/TO only/RB be/VB 2/VBN servers/NNS for/IN the/DT entire/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT bartender/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP clearly/RB could/MD n't/RB handle/VB a/DT lunchtime/NN rush/NN by/IN themselves/PRP ./.
Luckily/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP many/JJ other/JJ excellent/JJ taco/NN shops/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
A/DT hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN but/CC amazing/VBG quesadilla/NN !/NNS !/VBP !/.
The/DT tacos/NNS were/VBD alright/RB ,/, the/DT star/NN of/IN this/DT restaurant/NN would/MD definitely/RB have/VB to/TO be/VB the/DT quesadilla/NN ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB go/VB here/RB and/CC not/RB order/VB one/CD or/CC two/CD or/CC THREE/NNP !/NNP !/.
Lol/NNP the/DT bread/crust/dough/JJ if/IN the/DT quesadilla/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN for/IN the/DT nachos/NNS they/PRP provide/VBP while/IN you/PRP wait/VBP for/IN your/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ fun/JJ and/CC there/RB are/VBP some/DT good/JJ selections/NNS ,/, esp/VB the/DT cilantro/NN one/CD and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB like/IN cilantro/NN ./.
Other/JJ than/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN I/PRP should/MD have/VB brushed/VBN up/RP on/IN my/PRP$ Rosetta/NNP Stone/NNP Spanish/NNP Edition/NNP before/IN trying/VBG to/TO find/NNP La/NNP Condessa/NNP I/PRP can/MD honestly/RB say/VB I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN better/VBN tacos/NNS in/IN PHX/NNP ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ hard/NN to/TO find/VB if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ your/JJ first/JJ time/NN so/RB after/IN multiple/JJ turn/NN arounds/NNS and/CC a/DT stop/NN at/IN the/DT Panaderia/NNP to/TO ask/VB for/IN directions/NNS my/JJ colleague/NN and/CC I/PRP arrived/VBD at/IN taco/NN bliss/NNS ./.
The/DT meal/NN starts/NNS off/RP with/IN an/DT endless/JJ bowl/NN of/IN fresh/JJ tortilla/NN chips/NNS and/CC a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN that/WDT would/MD make/VB Bobby/NNP Flay/NNP jealous/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS homemade/NN salsas/VBZ with/IN a/DT large/JJ variety/NN ./.
From/NNP your/VBD classic/JJ Pico/NNP De/NNP Gallo/NNP to/TO a/DT Creamy/NNP Cilantro/NNP salsa/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT two/CD taco/NN platter/NN with/IN a/DT tinga/NN taco/NN and/CC a/DT carne/NN asada/NN Taco/NNP ./.
These/DT were/VBD both/DT great/JJ ./.
The/DT carne/NN asada/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/NN for/IN my/NN taste/NN but/CC with/IN the/DT assist/NN of/IN the/DT homemade/NN salsa/NN 's/POS it/PRP was/VBD a/DT perfect/JJ combo/NN ./.
The/DT tinga/NN taco/NN was/VBD a/DT perfect/JJ combination/NN of/IN slowly/RB cooked/VBN shredded/JJ chicken/NN and/CC seasoning/NN ./.
My/NNP colleague/NN got/VBD a/DT carne/NN asada/NN burrito/NN and/CC a/DT tinga/NN taco/NN and/CC was/VBD satisfied/VBN by/IN both/DT ./.
In/IN short/JJ if/IN I/PRP am/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT great/JJ taco/NN for/IN a/DT good/JJ price/NN I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG back/RB to/TO La/NNP Condesa/NNP ./.

A/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO bring/VB visitors/NNS from/IN out/IN of/IN town/NN ./.
Aargh/NNP -/VBD the/DT two/CD reasons/NNS I/PRP come/VBP are/VBP the/DT two/CD reasons/NNS I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB give/VB this/DT place/NN what/WP could/MD be/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ due/JJ worth/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD specifically/RB to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ salsas/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ horchata/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB I/PRP never/RB really/RB got/VBN to/TO try/VB either/DT b/c/NN they/PRP had/VBD run/VBN out/RP pretty/RB much/JJ out/IN of/IN all/DT of/IN it/PRP ./.
Probably/RB a/DT good/JJ sign/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP busy/JJ and/CC popular/JJ but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, a/DT big/JJ disappointment/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBP their/PRP$ two/CD taco/NN plate/NN ./.
The/DT cochinita/NN pibil/NN and/CC veggie/NN tacos/NNS ./.
Both/DT were/VBD ok/NN ./.
The/DT beans/NNS were/VBD ok/JJ but/CC not/RB nearly/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN America/NNP 's/POS homemade/NN beans/NNS ./.
The/DT rice/NN was/VBD like/IN everyone/NN said/VBD -/JJ not/RB your/VB typical/JJ mexican/JJ rice/NN ./.
Not/RB bad/JJ though/IN ./.
Apparently/RB they/PRP were/VBD so/RB busy/JJ they/PRP could/MD barely/RB keep/VB up/RP with/IN ``/`` supply/NN ''/'' ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN was/VBD pretty/
With/IN only/RB the/DT one/CD remaining/NN tortilla/NN ,/, you/PRP do/VBP get/RB some/DT drippage/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP can/MD add/VB more/RBR salsa/JJ to/TO any/DT veggies/NNS and/CC cheese/NN that/IN fall/NN out/IN and/CC eat/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT spoon/NN ./.
Then/RB for/IN dessert/NN ,/, I/PRP pour/VBP the/DT cilantro/NN salsa/NN on/IN my/PRP$ rice/NN ./.
Mmmm/NNP ,/, salsa/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD buy/VB this/DT stuff/NN by/IN the/DT tub/NN if/IN they/PRP would/MD let/VB me/PRP ./.
BTW/NNP ,/, I/PRP asked/VBD -/JJ they/PRP just/RB laughed/VBD ./.
The/DT only/JJ draw/NN back/RB is/VBZ that/IN my/PRP$ poor/NN husband/NN tries/NNS to/TO order/VB a/DT margarita/NN every/DT time/NN we/PRP go/VB ,/, and/CC they/PRP still/RB do/VBP n't/RB have/VB any/DT ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP someday/JJ they/PRP will/MD take/VB his/PRP$ advice/NN and/CC add/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT menu/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ search/NN for/IN a/DT more/JJR authentic/JJ Mexico/NNP City/NNP style/NN taco/NN ,/, we/PRP came/VBD across/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP happy/JJ to/TO report/NN that/IN the/DT tacos/NNS here/RB are/VBP about/RB as/RB authentic/JJ as/IN one/CD can/MD hope/VB to/TO find/VB north/NN of/IN the/DT border/NN ./.
The/DT Horchatas/NNP are/VBP fun/JJ and/CC tasty/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT small/JJ dank/NN dining/VBG space/NN brought/NNS back/RB memories/NNS of/IN the/DT small/JJ eateries/NNS way/NN down/IN south/NN ./.
So/RB why/RB only/RB 3/VBN stars/NNS ?/.
The/DT price/NN is/VBZ not/RB right/RB ./.
For/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN four/CD (/NNS with/IN two/CD kids/NNS )/RB ,/, we/PRP walked/VBD out/RP with/IN a/DT bill/NN of/IN $/$ 55/CD ./.
All/DT we/PRP ordered/VBP was/VBD one/CD round/NN of/IN tacos/NNS and/CC some/DT Horchatas/NNP ./.
Ouch/NNP ./.
Down/NNP in/IN the/DT DF/NNP ,/, one/CD can/MD find/VB better/RBR quality/NN and/CC quantity/NN at/IN a/DT full-service/JJ sit/NN down/IN restaurant/NN for/IN 1/3/CD that/IN price/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP looking/VBG for/IN something/NN that/IN does/VBZ n't/RB exist/VB in/IN Phoenix/NNP and/CC I/PRP should/MD just/RB be/VB happy/JJ to/TO have/VB this/DT food/NN at/IN any/DT price/NN (/NN or/CC perhaps/RB I/PRP just/RB paid/VBD the/DT ``/`` Guy/NNP Fieri/NNP tax/NN ''/'' )/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Santisima/NNP special/NNP quesadilla/NNP ,/, which/WDT should/MD not/RB be/VB named/VBN something/NN so/RB bland/JJ and/CC unremarkable/JJ as/IN a/DT quesadilla/NN ;/: it/PRP was/VBD the/DT demi-god/NN of/IN quesadillas/NNS ,/, more/JJR of/IN an/DT empanada/NN ,/, the/DT hercules/NNS of/IN Mexican/JJ food/NN ;/: it/PRP could/MD beat/VB up/RP your/PRP$ dad/NN is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP 'm/VBP saying/VBG ,/, unless/IN your/PRP$ dad/NN is/VBZ really/RB old/JJ then/RB it/PRP would/MD help/VB him/PRP out/IN of/IN his/PRP$ chair/NN and/CC bring/RB all/PDT the/DT salsa/NN options/NNS to/TO the/DT table/JJ to/TO give/VB his/PRP$ old/JJ bones/NNS some/DT rest/NN ./.

The/DT tacos/NNS always/RB have/VBP large/JJ portions/NNS of/IN meat/NN and/CC fixings/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ places/NNS to/TO take/VB out/RP of/IN town/NN visitors/NNS ./.

On/IN top/NN of/IN that/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD small/JJ and/CC claustrophobic/JJ ,/, there/EX was/VBD 3/JJ groups/NNS of/IN screaming/VBG kids/NNS that/WDT echoed/VBD the/DT entire/JJ time/NN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD not/RB recommend/VB this/DT to/TO anyone/NN !/NNS !/.
!/NN
The/DT absolute/JJ best/NN Burros/NNS and/CC street/NN tacos/NNS for/IN a/DT great/JJ reasonable/JJ price/NN !/.
/DT best/JJS taco/NN was/VBD the/DT pork/NN shoulder/NN taco/NN which/WDT was/VBD moist/JJ and/CC tasted/VBN great/JJ ./.
I/PRP also/RB tried/VBD all/DT of/IN the/DT tacos/NNS with/IN the/DT spicy/NN guacamole/NN provided/NN at/IN the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN for/IN an/DT added/NN kick/NN ./.
The/DT pork/NN burrito/NN used/VBD a/DT flour/JJ tortilla/NN and/CC was/VBD relatively/RB bland/JJ aside/NN from/IN the/DT pineapple/NN salsa/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT refreshing/NN sweet/JJ flavour/NN ./.
Overall/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ portion/NN ,/, but/CC was/VBD a/DT little/JJ expensive/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ definitely/RB authentic/JJ and/CC provided/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ taco/NN ./.
Great/NNP place/NNP !/.
Reasonable/JJ price/NN with/IN delicious/JJ food/NN and/CC friendly/RB service/NN ./.
The/DT cafe/NN were/VBD cute/JJ and/CC sweet/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT shop/NN inside/NN was/VBD beautiful/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ ./.
I/PRP think/VBP most/JJ people/NNS have/VBP a/DT ``/`` go/NN to/TO ''/'' restaurant/NN &/CC for/IN us/PRP it/PRP 's/VBZ this/DT amazing/JJ place/NN for/IN Mexican/NNP food/NN ./.
We/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN around/IN the/DT Phoenix/NNP area/NN for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ wonderful/JJ to/TO see/VB a/DT new/JJ business/NN succeed/VBD right/NN from/IN the/DT start/NN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ this/DT place/NN !/.
Wonderful/NNP menu/NNP !/.

Nice/NNP atmosphere/RB !/.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN the/DT east/NN valley/NN or/CC really/RB anywhere/RB in/IN the/DT valley/NN ,/, give/VBP it/PRP a/DT try/NN !/.
You/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB disappointed/VBN !/.
Great/NNP place/NNP ,/, great/JJ Flavours/NNP -/NNP 7/NNP chili/NN ,/, cilantro/NN and/CC strawberry/JJ salsa/NN are/VBP must/JJ try/NN ./.
In/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN ,/, I/PRP tried/VBD chicken/VBN tinga/NN and/CC a/DT burro/NN ,/, the/DT meat/NN was/VBD well/RB cooked/VBN and/CC juicy/NN ./.
Place/NNP was/VBD small/JJ ,/, but/CC nice/JJ ambience/NN ./.
The/DT neighborhood/NN was/VBD litle/JJ shady/NN but/CC the/DT quality/NN of/IN food/NN defeats/NNS all/DT those/DT negative/JJ factors/NNS ./.
Definitely/RB recommended/VBD ./.
Ps/NNP -/VBD the/DT place/NN is/VBZ open/JJ late/JJ till/NN 11pm/CD ,/, even/RB though/IN yelp/JJ hours/NN shows/VBZ 9pm/CD ./.
La/NNP Condesa/NNP ,/, I/PRP give/VBD up/RP on/IN you/PRP ./.
We/PRP try/VBP and/CC try/VBD to/TO excuse/VB the/DT terrible/JJ service/NN ,/, but/CC no/DT more/JJR ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB worth/JJ it/PRP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB slow/JJ and/CC inattentive/JJ and/CC they/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB give/VB a/DT damn/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'll/MD take/VB my/PRP$ $/$ 33/CD elsewhere/RB ./.
This/DT time/NN we/PRP were/VBD disappointed/VBN by/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
We/PRP returned/VBP our/VBN horchata/NN for/IN being/VBG too/RB thin/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ ,/, and/CC you/PRP brought/VBD us/PRP new/JJ ones/NNS after/IN we/PRP finished/VBD eating/VBG ./.
You/PRP drizzled/VBD a/DT pretty/NN crema/NN all/DT over/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN my/PRP$ torta/NN (/NN sorry/NN ,/, lonche/JJ )/NN ./.
How/NNP do/VBP I/PRP pick/VB it/PRP up/IN and/CC eat/VB it/PRP ?/.
In/IN the/DT past/JJ we/NN forgave/VBP the/DT dirty/JJ tables/NNS and/CC loudness/NN because/IN your/PRP$ cochinita/NN pibil/NN was/VBD pure/JJ bliss/NN ./.
But/CC not/RB even/RB that/IN makes/VBZ up/RP for/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
:/: (/.
Meh/NNP ./.
The/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN my/PRP$ order/NN was/VBD the/DT rice/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT taco/NN combo/NN plate/NN with/IN 3/JJ tacos/NNS ./.
The/DT taco/NN shells/NNS were/VBD way/VBN too/RB crispy/JJ and/CC dripping/JJ with/IN grease/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD hardly/RB bite/VB them/PRP ./.
Not/RB really/RB impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT flavors/NNS of/IN the/DT different/JJ meats/NNS I/PRP chose/VBP ./.
For/IN what/WP I/PRP ordered/VBP ,/, over-priced/JJ and/CC the/DT flavor/NN was/VBD underwhelming/VBG ./.
I/PRP really/VBP like/IN La/NNP Condesa/NNP ./.
What/WP stands/VBD out/RP is/VBZ the/DT variety/NN of/IN fresh/JJ salsas/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ salsa/NN bar/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT great/JJ variety/NN of/IN tacos/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN the/DT shrimp/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN different/JJ versions/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ steak/JJ tacos/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP also/RB had/VBD the/DT mole/JJ chicken/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD great/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.
Service/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ sketchy/NN here/RB ,/, mostly/RB because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP often/RB very/RB busy/JJ ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO try/NN ./.
We/PRP drove/VBP down/RB from/IN Prescott/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, to/TO do/VB a/DT little/JJ shopping/NN and/CC found/VBD this/DT place/NN via/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
SO/NNP glad/VBD we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO drive/VB the/DT extra/JJ 20/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB there/RB (/VBN despite/IN being/VBG surrounded/VBN by/IN restaurants/NNS at/IN the/DT mall/JJ )/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN vegans/NNS ,/, vegetarians/NNS ,/, and/CC meat/NN eaters/NNS alike/VBP ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT Ghandi/NNP and/CC the/DT veggie/NN tacos/VBZ (/JJ cactus/NN )/NN ,/, while/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN had/VBD meaty/NN street/NN tacos/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ &/CC delicious/JJ and/CC the/DT portion/NN size/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ ./.
Loved/VBD the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN !/NN !/.
Other/JJ reviewers/NNS mentioned/VBD the/DT dried/VBN cranberries/NNS in/IN the/DT guacamole/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ sweet/JJ addition/NN and/CC the/DT guac/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ !/.
We/PRP will/MD definitely/RB return/VB for/IN a/DT meal/NN next/JJ time/NN we/PRP 're/VBP in/IN Phoenix/NNP hungry/NN for/IN Mexican/NNP food/NN ./.

The/DT quesadillas/NNS are/VBP a/DT must/JJ have/NN ./.
Loved/VBD the/DT salsas/NNS ,/, had/VBD many/JJ to/TO pick/NN from/IN ./.
Highly/RB recommend/VBP this/DT yummy/NN place/NN ./.
Poor/NN service/NN ,/, took/VBD over/IN an/DT hour/NN to/TO get/VB burritos/NNS ,/, freezing/VBG air/NN conditioning/VBG blowing/NN right/NN on/IN us/PRP ,/, sound/NN system/NN not/RB working/VBG just/RB crackling/VBG loudly/RB the/DT whole/JJ time/NN ./.
They/PRP charge/VBP 5/RB $/$ more/RBR just/RB to/TO get/VB sour/JJ cream/NN and/CC enchilada/NN sauce/NN on/IN burrito/NN ./.
Unique/IN atmosphere/RB complimented/VBN by/IN wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN free/JJ salsa/NN ./.
Reasonable/JJ prices/NNS and/CC pleasant/NN service/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ great/JJ !/.
I/PRP went/VBD multiple/JJ times/NNS during/IN my/JJ time/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP and/CC luckily/RB did/VBD not/RB have/VB to/TO wait/VB too/RB long/RB each/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT streets/NNS tacos/NNS are/VBP hearty/JJ and/CC well/RB seasoned/VBN ./.
The/DT best/JJS part/NN are/VBP all/PDT the/DT salsa/NN options/NNS you/PRP get/VB to/TO choose/NN from/IN and/CC the/DT included/NN chips/NNS that/WDT come/NN with/IN your/PRP$ order/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB fun/JJ trying/VBG all/PDT the/DT salsas/NNS and/CC they/PRP go/VBP great/JJ with/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
The/DT margaritas/NNS are/VBP also/RB pretty/RB delicious/JJ based/VBN on/IN the/DT sips/NNS I/PRP had/VBD from/IN others/NNS ./.
The/DT horchata/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB unique/JJ with/IN the/DT added/NN fruit/NN and/CC is/VBZ not/RB as/RB creamy/JJ as/IN other/JJ preparations/NNS but/CC is/VBZ still/RB refreshing/VBG !/.
A/DT nice/JJ spot/NN for/IN lunch/NN or/CC dinner/NN !/.
I/PRP bought/VBD a/DT groupon/NN here/RB last/JJ year/NN and/CC finally/RB got/VBD around/IN to/TO trying/VB the/DT place/NN ./.
My/NNP son/NN and/CC I/PRP are/VBP pretty/RB picky/JJ eaters/NNS ,/, so/IN we/PRP kind/VBP of/IN created/NN our/PRP$ own/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT chicken/NN and/CC bean/JJ burrito/NN enchilada/NN style/NN ,/, with/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP the/DT heck/NN was/VBD in/IN that/DT burrito/NN ,/, but/CC pretty/RB sure/JJ the/DT meat/NN was/VBD not/RB chicken/VBN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT stomach/JJ ache/NN before/IN even/RB walking/VBG out/RP .../: .I/NNP honestly/RB should/MD have/VB asked/VBN for/IN a/DT different/JJ item/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP was/VBD wrong/JJ with/IN the/DT meat/NN ./.
The/DT portion/NN itself/NN was/VBD huge/JJ ./.
Very/NNP large/JJ plate/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN I/PRP liked/VBD ,/, lots/NNS of/IN different/JJ options/NNS ,/, Inside/NN was/VBD cute/JJ ./.
Warning/NNP though/NNP ,/, parking/NN is/VBZ a/DT hot/NN mess/NN ,/, its/PRP$ literally/NN on/IN 16th/CD st./NN Good/NNP luck/NNP getting/VBD out/RP of/IN there/EX during/IN traffic/NN ./.
Waiter/NNP was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, but/CC slow/RB ./.
Over/IN all/DT I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD say/VB ,/, the/DT beer/NN battered/VBD fish/JJ taco/NN sounded/VBD good/JJ ./.
May/NNP go/VBD back/RB to/TO try/NN that/IN ,/, but/CC other/JJ than/IN that/DT based/VBN on/IN what/WP I/PRP ate/VBP ,/, we/PRP wont/MD be/VB returning/VBG ./.
Came/NN in/IN at/IN around/IN 4PM/CD on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP ,/, parking/NN was/VBD terrible/JJ but/CC we/PRP assumed/VBD it/PRP had/VBD to/TO be/VB good/JJ since/IN the/DT parking/NN lot/NN was/VBD packed/VBN ./.
Walked/NNP in/IN and/CC the/DT whole/JJ front/NN room/NN was/VBD packed/VBN with/IN patrons/NNS so/IN we/PRP waited/VBD patiently/RB to/TO be/VB seated/VBN ./.
The/DT artwork/NN was/VBD phenomenal/JJ and/CC the/DT full/JJ bar/NN was/VBD inviting/VBG ,/, but/CC after/IN five/CD minutes/NNS of/IN not/RB being/VBG acknowledged/VBN in/IN any/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD starting/VBG to/TO lose/VB patience/NN ./.
Finally/RB we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN in/IN the/DT back/NNP room/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ much/JJ larger/NN and/CC at/IN the/DT time/NN nearly/RB empty/JJ except/IN for/IN two/CD groups/NNS of/IN 5/JJ people/NNS ./.
We/PRP both/VBP ordered/VBN three/CD tacos/NNS each/DT ,/, which/WDT were/VBD way/RB pricier/JJR than/IN we/PRP were/VBD expecting/VBG ,/, they/PRP range/VBP between/IN 3.99/CD and/CC 5.50/CD each/NN or/CC you/PRP can/MD do/VB a/DT mix/NN and/CC match/NN plate/NN ./.
Many/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ options/NNS are/VBP seafood/VBN so/RB that/IN limited/NNP us/VBD a/DT bit/NN since/IN we/PRP are/VBP n't/RB fans/NNS ,/, though/IN if/IN you/PRP like/VBP seafood/NN maybe/NN you/PRP 'll/MD have/VB better/RBR luck/JJ than/IN we/PRP did/VBD !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ extensive/JJ so/IN we/PRP were/VBD excited/VBN ,/, we/PRP loaded/VBD up/RP 12/CD mini/NN condiment/NN cups/NNS ,/, filling/VBG them/PRP with/IN everything/NN from/IN clearly/NNP pico/NN to/TO some/DT more/RBR mysterious/JJ salsas/NNS ./.
Tried/NNP out/VBD a/DT few/JJ on/IN the/DT chips/NNS as/IN we/PRP waited/VBD for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN and/CC found/VBD that/IN none/NN of/IN them/PRP were/VBD spicy/NN in/IN any/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT best/NN was/VBD the/DT Pico/NNP and/CC another/DT similar/JJ to/TO it/PRP ./.
Finally/RB our/VBD tacos/NNS arrived/VBN and/CC we/PRP dug/VBP in/IN ./.
Well/NNP we/VBD tried/CD to/TO ./.
Instead/RB we/PRP each/DT ate/NN about/IN half/DT of/IN each/DT taco/NN (/NN except/IN for/IN the/DT barbiccoa/NN which/WDT both/DT of/IN us/PRP got/VBD ,/, I/PRP ate/VBP both/DT of/IN them/PRP after/IN he/PRP discovered/VBD he/PRP hated/VBD it/PRP )/-NONE- ./.
Each/DT taco/NN ranged/VBD from/IN bad/JJ to/TO almost/RB inedible/JJ ./.
Each/DT taco/NN was/VBD miniscule/JJ ,/, barely/RB the/DT size/NN of/IN my/PRP$ hand/NN and/CC barely/RB filled/VBD except/IN for/IN the/DT lack/NN luster/NN and/CC down/IN right/RB gross/VBZ tasting/VBG garnish/JJ ./.
The/DT meat/NN quality/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ habd/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, tasteless/JJ but/CC great/JJ quality/NN so/IN there/EX was/VBD room/NN for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB delicious/JJ ,/, they/PRP just/RB failed/VBD that/IN goal/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN the/DT only/RB tacos/VBZ I/PRP could/MD suggest/VB were/VBD the/DT barbiccoa/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD good/JJ enough/NN to/TO even/RB crave/VB again/RB but/CC for/IN the/DT price/NN and/CC how/WRB lacking/JJ everything/NN else/NN was/VBD ,/, I/PRP can/MD guarantee/VB we/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB returning/VBG ./.
I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB this/DT place/NN to/TO anyone/NN with/IN family/NN or/CC friends/NNS who/WP like/IN a/DT great/JJ setting/NN and/CC casual/JJ drinks/NNS with/IN some/DT small/JJ bites/NNS ,/, especially/RB if/IN they/PRP 're/VBP not/RB generally/RB fans/NNS of/IN Mexican/NNP food/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ inviting/VBG and/CC interesting/JJ with/IN plenty/NN of/IN tasteless/NN options/NNS to/TO explore/VB ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT fan/NN of/IN big/JJ fancy/NN ,/, red/VBD carpet/JJ joints/NNS ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT place/NN for/IN you/PRP ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ understaffed/JJ ,/, the/DT restaurant/JJ itself/NN is/VBZ small/JJ and/CC there/EX are/VBP a/DT boat/JJ load/NN of/IN people/NNS there/RB ./.

The/DT carne/NN asada/NN was/VBD okay/NN ;/: not/RB great/JJ ./.

But/CC the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, so/RB avoid/RB peak/VB times/NNS or/CC get/VB your/JJ food/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS Mexican/JJ spots/NNS in/IN town/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ (/NN salsa/NN bar/NN !/NN )/.

That/DT said/VBD ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ crammed/VBN -/JJ try/NN to/TO go/VB on/IN a/DT night/NN when/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ less/JJR busy/NN to/TO avoid/VB feeling/VBG the/DT full/JJ brunt/NN of/IN that/DT ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN slow/NN but/CC worth/IN the/DT wait/NN after/IN visiting/VBG here/RB from/IN the/DT East/NNP Coast/NNP it/PRP was/VBD great/JJ to/TO get/VB some/DT real/JJ authentic/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN I/PRP had/VBD the/DT shark/NN tacos/VBZ &/CC recommend/VB to/TO everyone/NN

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT place/NN that/IN I/PRP take/VBP out/RP of/IN town/NN visitors/NNS ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ small/JJ and/CC often/RB you/PRP have/VBP to/TO wait/VB but/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT food/NN makes/VBZ up/RP for/IN those/DT things/NNS ./.
I/PRP am/VBP giving/VBG this/DT place/NN 4/NN stars/NNS because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ unique/JJ ./.
The/DT night/NN we/PRP went/VBD it/PRP was/VBD crowded/VBN .../: but/CC we/PRP went/VBD because/IN of/IN all/PDT the/DT hype/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP and/CC my/NNP quest/NN for/IN Fish/JJ Tacos/NNP ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
I/PRP tried/VBP all/PDT the/DT salsa/NN 's/POS and/CC only/RB liked/VBD a/DT few/JJ ./.

The/DT Shark/NNP Taco/NNP needed/VBD a/DT better/JJR sauce/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB enjoyed/VBN it/PRP much/RB better/JJR ./.
Truthfully/RB ,/, I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB find/VB the/DT shark/NN tacos/VBZ as/RB great/JJ as/IN everyone/NN else/RB does/VBZ on/IN these/DT reviews/NNS ,/, but/CC then/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP new/JJ to/TO Fish/JJ Tacos/NNP ./.
I/PRP also/RB tried/VBD the/DT Mayan/NNP Cochinita/NNP Pibil/NNP Taco/NNP ,/, I/PRP found/VBD this/DT flavor/NN strong/JJ (/NN unlike/NN other/JJ Mexican/NNP places/NNS I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN )/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB care/VB for/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT bad/JJ ,/, my/JJ son/NN ordered/IN the/DT steak/JJ Quesa/NN ./.
He/PRP did/VBD n't/RB care/VB for/IN it/PRP at/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP did/VBD like/IN this/DT ,/, but/CC then/RB the/DT waitress/NN took/VBD the/DT entire/JJ thing/NN away/RB when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB done/VBN with/IN it/PRP and/CC Dave/NNP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB get/VB a/DT chance/NN to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
So/IN that/DT was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ disappointing/NN ,/, given/IN he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB eat/VB hardly/RB any/DT of/IN it/PRP ./.

Though/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD decent/JJ ,/, not/RB amazing/VBG ,/, the/DT service/NN was/VBD poor/JJ enough/JJ to/TO not/RB ever/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP felt/VBD bad/JJ for/IN the/DT servers/NNS ,/, there/EX was/VBD 2/CD of/IN them/PRP and/CC they/PRP seemed/VBD overwhelmed/VBN ./.

Like/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT other/JJ reviews/NNS the/DT best/JJS thing/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ,/, however/RB most/JJS of/IN the/DT ``/`` good/JJ ''/'' salsas/NNS were/VBD empty/NN and/CC never/RB refilled/VBD during/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN ./.

They/PRP ca/MD n't/RB add/VB beans/NNS inside/VBP like/IN somebody/NN mentioned/VBN ,/, only/RB on/IN the/DT side/NN (/VBD make/VB sure/JJ to/TO ask/NN for/IN beans/NNS without/IN cheese/NN on/IN top/JJ )/NN If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT ``/`` junk/NN vegan/NN ''/'' you/PRP may/MD be/VB good/JJ to/TO go/NN ./.
I/PRP personally/RB hardly/RB eat/JJ fried/JJ things/NNS and/CC wanted/VBD to/TO make/VB an/DT exception/NN for/IN this/DT ./.
They/PRP fry/VBP the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN so/IN it/PRP sits/VBZ in/IN a/DT layer/NN of/IN oil/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN and/CC the/DT spinach/NN and/CC mushrooms/NNS etc/JJ inside/NN are/VBP soaked/JJ as/IN well/RB -/JJ all/DT I/PRP tasted/VBD was/VBD the/DT oil/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP only/RB been/VBN vegan/JJ for/IN a/DT year/NN so/IN I/PRP can/MD imagine/VB this/DT must/MD be/VB really/RB good/JJ with/IN the/DT cheese/NN but/CC in/IN vegan/JJ you/PRP may/MD be/VB better/VBN off/RP with/IN a/DT burrito/NN or/CC taco/NN ./.
Omni/NNP hubby/NN had/VBD the/DT tacos/NNS and/CC loved/VBD them/PRP !/.

Maybe/NNP I/PRP missed/VBD something/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN more/JJR dissappointed/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ culinary/JJ adventures/NNS ./.
The/DT chips/NNS were/VBD alright/RB .../: the/DT array/NN of/IN salsas/NNS was/VBD impressive/JJ and/CC all/PDT the/DT ones/NNS I/PRP sampled/VBD were/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ./.

The/DT Condesa/NNP Shrimp/NNP taco/NN had/VBD WAAAY/NNP too/RB much/JJ garlic/NN and/CC the/DT shrimp/NN had/VBD zero/VBN flavor/NN -/NN I/PRP came/VBD across/IN at/IN least/JJS 10/CD full/JJ slices/NNS and/CC I/PRP still/RB have/VBP the/DT taste/NN of/IN garlic/NN in/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN hours/NNS later/JJ ./.
Overall/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB horrible/JJ -/JJ it/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB good/JJ -/NN definately/RB not/RB 25/VB dollars/NNS worth/VBP -/JJ this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT place/NN I/PRP would/MD return/VB to/TO nor/NN would/MD I/VB recommend/VBP it/PRP to/TO anyone/VB else/RB If/IN you/PRP want/VBP good/JJ street/NN tacos/NNS see/VBP my/PRP$ reviews/NN ./.

after/IN i/NNP had/VBD been/VBN seated/VBN ,/, we/PRP still/RB waited/VBD 20/CD minutes/NNS for/IN someone/NN to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ order/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB even/RB the/DT server/NN that/IN 's/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
it/PRP was/VBD the/DT hostess/NN that/IN took/JJ our/NN order/NN and/CC told/VBD us/PRP ``/`` our/NN ''/'' server/NN would/MD be/VB by/IN with/IN out/JJ food/NN ./.
i/NN like/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, not/RB the/DT disorganization/NN though/IN
Being/VBG from/IN Los/NNP Angeles/NNP I/PRP pride/VBP myself/JJ on/IN having/NN discovered/IN some/DT great/JJ taco/NN shops/NNS and/CC trucks/NNS ./.
La/NNP Santisima/NNP was/VBD a/DT Yelp/NNP driven/VBP decision/NN right/RB before/IN driving/VBG back/RB to/TO CA/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD absolutely/RB amazing/JJ .../: .../: .../: .an/JJ explosion/NN of/IN flavor/NN that/IN is/VBZ second/JJ to/TO none/NN ./.
You/PRP can/MD taste/VB the/DT attention/NN given/NN to/TO the/DT preparation/NN and/CC the/DT quality/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT ingredients/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO always/RB make/VB time/NN whenever/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN Phoenix/NNP to/TO stop/VB in/IN .../: .../: .../: however/RB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ so/RB special/JJ that/IN I/PRP may/MD actually/RB drive/VB back/RP every/DT so/RB often/RB for/IN a/DT fix/NN ./.
Every/NNP once/RB in/IN a/DT while/NN yelp/NN is/VBZ just/RB flat/JJ out/IN wrong/JJ and/CC that/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN la/NN santisima/NN taco/NN shop/NN ./.
Every/NNP review/VBD makes/IN you/PRP think/VBP it/PRP will/MD be/VB amazing/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT reality/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ ok/JJ ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP much/JJ better/NN places/NNS to/TO eat/VB in/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.
So/IN what/WP is/VBZ wrong/JJ with/IN this/DT place/NN ?/.
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, what/WP the/DT heck/JJ kind/NN of/IN quesadilla/NN are/VBP the/DT making/NN ?/.
I/PRP am/VBP still/RB not/RB sure/JJ ./.
Why/WRB fry/JJ a/DT tortilla/NN and/CC throw/NN some/DT cheese/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN ,/, it/PRP just/RB does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB any/DT sense/NN to/TO me/PRP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP quesadillas/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT one/NN was/VBD not/RB good/JJ ./.
Second/NNP ,/, the/DT ``/`` carne/NN asada/NN ''/'' was/VBD not/RB good/JJ ./.
It/PRP just/RB did/VBD n't/RB have/VB much/JJ flavor/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ burrito/NN that/IN I/PRP liked/VBD was/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN burrito/NN ,/, although/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB realize/VB that/IN it/PRP had/VBD mushrooms/NNS in/IN it/PRP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD disappointing/JJ ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT tortilla/NN chips/NNS are/VBP ok/JJ ./.
The/DT location/NN leaves/VBZ a/DT little/JJ bit/NN to/TO be/VB desired/VBN and/CC so/RB does/VBZ the/DT food/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ many/JJ will/MD go/VB to/TO this/DT place/NN based/VBN on/IN yelp/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
Best/NNP tacos/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN during/IN my/JJ week/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP ,/, with/IN a/DT literal/JJ buffet/NN of/IN well-made/JJ salsas/NNS to/TO match/NN ./.
Busy/NNP and/CC a/DT little/JJ disorganized/JJ at/IN lunch/NN (/IN they/PRP needed/VBD one/CD more/RBR person/JJ to/TO help/NN handle/VB the/DT crowd/NN )/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ seeking/VBG out/RP ./.
Get/NNP the/DT horchata/NN with/IN fruits/NNS and/CC pecans/NNS ,/, too/RB -/JJ it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ ./.
Came/NN here/RB after/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN had/VBD done/VBN seen/VBN it/PRP on/IN Yelp/NNP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB by/IN any/DT means/NNS a/DT large/JJ spacious/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT best/JJS Mexican/JJ restaurants/NNS are/VBP primarily/RB a/DT hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.
We/PRP split/VBD the/DT House/NNP Margarita/NNP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD asked/VBN for/IN no/DT salt/NN but/CC it/PRP still/RB came/VBD salted/VBN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, although/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB salt/NN on/IN my/PRP$ margarita/NN when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP trying/VBG one/CD for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN because/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO know/VB what/WP it/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN without/IN anything/NN added/VBD ./.
I/PRP got/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN (/NN because/IN I/PRP couldnt/VBP decide/JJ what/NN to/TO get/VB )/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT traditional/JJ Quesadilla/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ironically/RB not/RB a/DT traditional/JJ quesadilla/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT corn/NN tortilla/NN folded/VBD over/IN that/DT has/VBZ Oaxaca/NNP Cheese/NNP inside/NN and/CC its/PRP$ fried/JJ ./.
Its/PRP$ kinda/NN like/IN a/DT Calzone/NN but/CC better/JJR ./.
If/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO pick/VB a/DT cheese/NN that/WDT could/MD possibly/RB be/VB my/VBN favorite/JJ cheese/NN in/IN Mexican/NNP cuisine/NN it/PRP would/MD be/VB Oaxaca/NNP ./.
The/DT Quesadilla/NNP was/VBD amazing/VBG but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ HUGE/NNP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG something/NN around/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN my/PRP$ hand/NN ./.
Nope/NNP ,/, one/CD half/NN was/VBD probably/RB the/DT size/NN of/IN my/PRP$ hand/NN ./.
We/PRP did/VBD ask/NN for/IN no/DT crema/NN but/CC they/PRP still/RB put/VBP it/PRP on/IN there/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD the/DT Conchita/NNP Lonche/NNP ,/, the/DT meat/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ but/CC the/DT bread/NN was/VBD kinda/NN hard/NN ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ come/VB with/IN mustard/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP was/VBD not/RB expecting/VBG ./.
It/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT great/JJ thing/NN to/TO order/NN for/IN Lunch/NN for/IN anyone/NN who/WP works/NNS downtown/VBP (/IN which/WDT I/PRP do/VBP )/RB ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN got/VBD the/DT shark/NN taco/NN but/CC I/PRP was/VBD not/RB up/RB for/IN trying/VBG it/PRP mainly/RB because/IN I/PRP barely/RB eat/JJ fish/JJ tacos/NNS when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ cod/JJ inside/NN ./.
It/PRP did/VBD look/VB good/JJ displayed/VBN on/IN his/PRP$ plate/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB to/TO try/VB the/DT beans/NNS but/CC the/DT rice/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP a/DT hard/JJ time/NN judging/VBG rice/NN because/IN I/PRP still/RB believe/VBP my/JJ Nana/NNP makes/VBZ the/DT best/JJS white/JJ rice/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ but/CC the/DT woman/NN was/VBD the/DT only/RB one/CD really/NN taking/VBG care/NN of/IN tables/NNS and/CC about/IN 4/CD tables/NNS including/VBG us/PRP walked/VBD in/IN probably/NNP within/IN 5/NNP mins/NNS ./.
So/IN she/PRP was/VBD running/VBG around/IN taking/NN orders/NNS ,/, running/JJ food/NN and/CC then/RB touching/VBG back/RB to/TO the/DT tables/NNS to/TO see/VB if/IN anything/NN was/VBD alright/RB ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, I/PRP definitely/RB am/VBP coming/VBG back/RB ./.
Great/NNP atmosphere/RB ,/, phenomenal/JJ service/NN and/CC fantastic/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT baja/NN shark/NN tacos/NNS and/CC cabo/NN shrimp/NN tacos/NNS ./.
Fresh/NNP and/CC very/RB delicious/JJ to/TO say/VB the/DT least/NN ./.
A/DT MUST/NNP TRY/NNP !/.

I/PRP wish/VBP their/PRP$ space/NN was/VBD bigger/JJ and/CC had/VBD something/VBN further/RB on/IN the/DT northside/NN but/CC that/DT is/VBZ honestly/RB the/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP can/MD say/VB negative/JJ about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB had/VBN anything/NN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB ./.
Everyone/NNP who/NNP 's/POS visited/VBD me/PRP has/VBZ wanted/VBN to/TO come/VB back/RB to/TO Phoenix/NNP to/TO eat/VB these/DT tacos/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP go/VBP during/IN a/DT normal/JJ meal/NN time/NN expect/NN to/TO wait/VB probably/RB at/IN least/JJS an/DT hour/NN ./.

By/IN far/RB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ Mexican/NNP restaurants/NNS to/TO eat/VB at/IN in/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP it/PRP every/DT time/NN i/NN get/VB the/DT opportunity/NN ./.
Everything/NN from/IN their/PRP$ exceptional/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN to/TO their/PRP$ Quesas/NNS !/.
You/PRP will/MD not/RB leave/VB disappointed/JJ ./.
One/CD of/IN my/PRP$ ``/`` go/VB to/TO ''/'' places/NNS in/IN downtown/NN Phoenix/NNP ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, salsa/JJ bar/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./.
Very/NNP creative/JJ menu/NN ,/, so/IN you/PRP are/VBP n't/RB stuck/JJ with/IN just/RB a/DT single/JJ filling/NN choice/NN in/IN your/PRP$ tortilla/NN ./.
House/NNP special/NNP is/VBZ a/DT fave/NN ./.
Place/NNP is/VBZ very/RB small/JJ ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB an/DT energetic/JJ environment/NN for/IN a/DT meal/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP can/MD also/RB be/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT pain/NN when/WRB you/PRP want/VBP to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN someone/NN else/RB ./.
There/EX is/VBZ the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN with/IN around/IN a/DT dozen/NN house/NN made/VBD salsas/NNS ./.
I/PRP am/VBP truly/RB amazed/VBN by/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ small/JJ so/RB not/RB recommended/VBN for/IN big/JJ groups/NNS ./.
Maybe/NNP a/DT second/JJ date/NN if/IN you/PRP notice/VBP a/DT parking/NN spot/NN open/JJ as/IN you/PRP are/VBP approaching/VBG ./.
Horchata/NNP with/IN chopped/VBN nuts/NNS ,/, fruit/NN ,/, and/CC cinnamon/NN for/IN the/DT win/NN ./.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB to/TO Phoenix/NNP so/IN I/PRP can/MD eat/VB there/RB again/RB !/.
!/NN
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, the/DT service/NN was/VBD lacking/VBG ./.
Our/NNP waitress/NN did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB very/RB attentive/JJ or/CC happy/JJ towards/NNS us/PRP ./.
She/PRP could/MD have/VB checked/VBN on/IN us/PRP every/DT once/NN in/IN a/DT while/NN .../: and/CC maybe/VB smile/NN ?/.
HOWEVER/NNP ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ (/NN which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP had/VBD to/TO give/VB a/DT least/NN four/CD stars/NNS )/RB ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP their/PRP$ carne/NN asada/NN tacos/NNS and/CC they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB disappoint/VB ./.
Their/NNP salsa/NNP bar/NN has/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN choices/NNS and/CC yes/NNS ,/, the/DT horchata/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
Excellent/NNP food/NN ./.
Kinda/NNP steep/NN on/IN the/DT pricing/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT tacos/NNS is/VBZ by/IN far/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT largest/JJS portions/NNS you/PRP can/MD get/VB ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO eat/VB some/DT good/JJ ole/NN unadulterated/JJ tacos/NNS ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ outstanding/JJ as/IN well/RB ,/, a/DT lot/NN of/IN different/JJ styles/NNS and/CC heat/JJ levels/NNS ./.
The/DT self/NN serve/NN salsa/NN had/VBD a/DT great/JJ variety/NN and/CC was/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN fun/NN ./.
The/DT margaritas/NNS were/VBD n't/RB amazing/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN certainly/NN was/VBD ./.
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD a/DT few/JJ street/NN tacos/NNS ,/, but/CC particularly/RB enjoyed/VBD the/DT refried/VBN beans/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD visiting/VBG Phoenix/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ definitely/RB the/DT best/JJS Mexican/JJ food/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
We/PRP moved/VBD to/TO Arizona/NNP about/IN 4/CD months/NNS ago/IN and/CC had/VBD driven/VBN past/JJ this/DT place/NN several/JJ times/NNS ,/, but/CC last/JJ night/NN we/PRP saw/VBD it/PRP on/IN an/DT episode/NN of/IN Triple/NNP D/NNP and/CC decided/VBD its/PRP$ time/NN to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
Who/NNP doesnt/VBD love/JJ tacos/NNS ,/, especially/RB for/IN breakfast/brunch/NN !/.
But/CC they/PRP do/VBP serve/JJ actual/JJ breakfast/NN on/IN the/DT weekends/NNS too/RB ./.
We/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD this/DT restaurant/NN bookmarked/VBD for/IN a/DT while/NN after/IN seeing/VBG it/PRP on/IN Diners/NNS ,/, Drive-Ins/NNP ,/, and/CC Dives/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD attending/VBG a/DT show/NN in/IN Downtown/NNP Phoenix/NNP ,/, so/IN we/PRP went/VBD by/IN La/NNP Santisima/NNP before/IN that/DT ./.
It/PRP was/VBD around/IN 6-ish/JJ in/IN the/DT evening/NN when/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD and/CC there/EX were/VBD only/RB 1/CD or/CC 2/CD small/JJ tables/NNS open/JJ ,/, so/RB we/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN immediately/RB ./.
Getting/VBG to/TO the/DT table/JJ was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN like/IN walking/NN through/IN a/DT maze/NN since/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ small/JJ and/CC crowded/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB obvious/JJ that/IN they/PRP were/VBD super/NN busy/NN and/CC there/NNS were/VBD only/RB 2/JJ people/NNS taking/VBG orders/NNS ,/, delivering/VBG food/NN ,/, etc/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD a/DT while/NN for/IN them/PRP to/TO take/VB our/NN orders/NNS and/CC then/RB even/RB longer/VB to/TO bring/VB us/PRP chips/NNS to/TO snack/VB on/IN &/CC our/PRP$ drinks/NNS ./.
When/WRB they/PRP did/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD more/JJR than/IN happy/JJ to/TO wait/NN for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN as/IN we/PRP were/VBD were/VBD enjoying/VBG all/PDT the/DT different/JJ salsas/NNS with/IN the/DT chips/NNS !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN they/PRP have/VBP is/VBZ very/RB unique/JJ ./.
They/PRP had/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ salsas/NNS that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB had/VBD before/RB ./.
My/NNP favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT peanut/NN one/CD ./.
It/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN thick/NN and/CC creamy/NN with/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN spice/NN ./.
Other/JJ salsas/NNS that/IN both/DT me/NNS and/CC my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN liked/VBD were/VBD the/DT pecan/JJ salsa/NN ,/, the/DT salsa/NN roja/NN ,/, the/DT guacamole/NN ,/, etc/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD a/DT total/JJ of/IN maybe/NN 10/CD or/CC 12/CD different/JJ ones/NNS ,/, all/DT that/IN tasted/VBN great/NN with/IN the/DT chips/NNS and/CC also/RB on/IN our/PRP$ tacos/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP come/VBN back/RB here/RB just/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN !/.
As/IN far/RB as/IN our/PRP$ food/NN goes/NN ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Tinga/NNP taco/NN and/CC the/DT Cabo/NNP Shrimp/NNP taco/NN plate/NN with/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT La/NNP Santisima/NNP Speciality/NN tacos/NNS with/IN chicken/NN ./.
Both/IN the/DT tacos/NNS I/PRP ordered/VBP were/VBD completely/RB different/JJ from/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
The/DT Tinga/NNP taco/NN tasted/VBD good/JJ as/IN it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN but/CC I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN the/DT shrimp/NN taco/NN needed/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN salsas/NNS to/TO enhanced/VB the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT breaded/JJ shrimp/NN ./.
The/DT La/NNP Santisima/NNP Speciality/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD much/RB like/IN the/DT Tinga/NNP taco/NN in/IN that/DT there/NNS were/VBD a/DT bunch/NN of/IN different/JJ toppings/NNS on/IN them/PRP ,/, so/IN they/PRP tasted/VBD great/JJ as/IN served/VBN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN could/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC to/TO add/VB the/DT delicious/JJ salsas/NNS on/IN them/PRP anyways/RB ,/, however/RB !/.
Next/NNP time/NN ,/, we/PRP come/VBP in/IN ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD probably/RB skip/VB both/DT the/DT rice/NN &/CC beans/NNS and/CC instead/RB order/VBD one/CD more/RBR taco/NN !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB that/IN the/DT rice/NN &/CC beans/NNS were/VBD n't/RB good/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD just/RB that/IN the/DT tacos/NNS were/VBD SO/RB GOOD/NNP !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ that/IN everything/NN that/IN can/MD be/VB ordered/VBN a/DT la/NN carte/NN or/CC as/IN a/DT meal/NN ./.
Some/DT tacos/NNS are/VBP bit/JJ more/RBR expensive/JJ than/IN other/JJ ones/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT whole/JJ menu/NN seemed/VBD fairly/RB reasonably/RB priced/VBN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, like/IN I/PRP 've/VBP said/VBN ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ where/WRB there/RB could/MD be/VB some/DT improvement/NN ./.

I/PRP really/VBP like/IN the/DT filling/NN choices/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN a/DT taco/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ quesadillas/NNS are/VBP like/IN a/DT thick/NN fry/NN bread/NN ,/, I/PRP though/IN they/PRP we/PRP 're/VBP too/RB greasy/JJ but/CC everyone/NN else/RB raved/VBD ./.
Leave/NNP extra/JJ time/NN to/TO check/NN out/IN ,/, it/PRP took/VBD longer/JJR than/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
Their/NNP salsa/NNP bar/NN is/VBZ very/RB inventive/JJ ,/, and/CC tasty/NN ./.

The/DT best/JJS thing/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP everything/NN from/IN pico/NN to/TO strawberry/JJ to/TO pecan/JJ salsa/NN ./.
Some/DT were/VBD spicy/NN ,/, some/DT sweet/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ insane/NN ./.

Pretty/NNP cool/NN and/CC simple/NN taco/NN spot/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.
Small/JJ dining/JJ area/NN though/NN ,/, so/RB do/VBP n't/RB get/VB mad/RB if/IN there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT wait/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD so/RB totally/RB awesome/JJ and/CC unique/JJ ./.
My/NNP girlfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP are/VBP visiting/VBG from/IN Colorado/NNP and/CC this/DT place/NN was/VBD recommended/VBN by/IN a/DT local/JJ and/CC damn/JJ did/VBD we/PRP get/VB lucky/NN ./.

The/DT burritos/NNS and/CC the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN were/VBD out/IN of/IN this/DT world/NN amazing/VBG !/.
I/PRP grew/VBD up/RP in/IN the/DT SW/NNP but/CC have/VBP loved/VBN in/IN the/DT NE/NNP for/IN 20+/CD years/NNS ./.
Also/RB worked/VBD in/IN a/DT Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN during/IN high/JJ school/NN and/CC college/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD the/DT best/JJS Mexican/JJ food/NN I/PRP can/MD recall/VB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD Queso/VBN Fundido/NNP with/IN Choizo/NNP and/CC Poblanos/NNP ,/, paired/VBD with/IN a/DT 3-taco/JJ platter/NN of/IN Baby/NNP Shark/NNP ,/, Tiger/NNP Shrimp/NNP and/CC Mahi/NNP ./.
All/DT I/PRP got/VBD to/TO say/VB that/IN these/DT were/VBD the/DT best/JJS taco/NN 's/POS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Found/NNP this/DT place/NN by/IN chance/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP by/IN chance/NN on/IN a/DT visit/NN to/TO Phoenix/NNP for/IN the/DT Pro/NNP Bowl/NNP ./.
The/DT salsa/NN selection/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
Next/NNP time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN town/NN I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB there/RB again/RB ./.
Love/NNP the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN !/NN !/.
Kind/NNP of/IN a/DT tight/JJ squeeze/NN but/CC worth/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN here/RB twice/JJ now/RB and/CC both/DT visits/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT Salsa/NNP Bar/NNP they/PRP have/VBP with/IN fresh/JJ homemade/NN salsas/NNS ./.
Both/DT visits/NNS I/PRP ordered/VBP Taco/NNP plates/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN the/DT Tinga/NNP Chicken/NNP and/CC the/DT Carne/NNP Asada/NNP ./.
The/DT Chicken/NNP was/VBD much/JJ better/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP also/RB had/VBD the/DT mahi/NN taco/NN and/CC a/DT shrimp/NN taco/NN ./.
Those/NNS were/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
Their/NNP Horchata/NNP is/VBZ delicious/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN their/PRP$ rice/NN and/CC beans/VBZ that/IN accompany/NN their/PRP$ Taco/NNP Plates/NNP ./.
I/PRP highly/VBP recommend/JJ this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP hear/VBP their/PRP$ margaritas/NNS are/VBP great/JJ too/RB ./.
I/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB .../: .../: .many/JJ more/RBR times/NNS ./.
A/DT great/JJ little/NN taco/NN spot/NN hidden/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.
The/DT pastor/NN tacos/NNS have/VBP a/DT nice/JJ hit/NN of/IN spice/NN ,/, which/WDT contrasts/NNS well/RB with/IN the/DT sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT pineapple/NN ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ seriously/RB small/JJ ,/, we/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Tuesday/NNP afternoon/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD empty/JJ ,/, though/IN I/PRP can/MD see/VB La/NNP Santisima/NNP filling/VBG up/RP quickly/RB during/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD reserved/VBN ,/, but/CC not/RB rude/VB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB in/IN the/DT best/JJS neighborhood/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ kind/NN of/IN sad/JJ ,/, because/IN there/EX 's/VBZ an/DT elementary/JJ school/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN the/DT best/JJS eateries/NNS are/VBP usually/RB in/IN someplace/NN sketchy/NN ./.
Often/NNP ,/, you/PRP must/MD venture/VB outside/IN your/PRP$ comfort/NN zone/NN to/TO experience/VB the/DT sublime/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, I/PRP neglected/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD so/RB memorized/VBN by/IN the/DT pastor/NN tacos/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP definitely/RB return/VBN on/IN my/PRP$ next/JJ trip/NN to/TO PHX/NNP ./.
Fantastic/NNP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD gaucho/NN borro/NN ,/, was/VBD delicious/JJ but/CC I/PRP should/MD have/VB added/VBN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS ./.
Margaritas/NNP were/VBD tasty/JJ too/RB ./.
Guacamole/NNP was/VBD from/IN perfectly/RB ripe/JJ avocados/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP really/RB appreciated/VBD ./.
If/IN you/PRP go/VBP at/IN night/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB be/VB discouraged/VBN by/IN the/DT total/JJ lack/NN of/IN lighting/VBG outside/NNS ./.
Inside/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC staff/NN was/VBD welcoming/VBG ./.
Tip/NNP :/: When/WRB it/PRP says/VBZ 3.99/CD a/DT la/NN carte/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ actually/RB only/RB 1/CD taco/NN ./.
Only/IN the/DT taco/NN plate/NN has/VBZ 2/VBN tacos/NNS ./.
We/PRP made/VBD that/IN mistake/NN and/CC our/PRP$ bill/NN ended/VBD up/RP tripling/NN in/IN price/NN ./.
On/IN a/DT brighter/JJ note/NN ,/, the/DT horchata/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN horchata/NN filled/VBD with/IN so/RB much/JJ fruit/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD such/JJ a/DT large/JJ size/NN ,/, perfect/NN for/IN sharing/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT slow/JJ cooked/JJ pork/NN taco/NN and/CC I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/NN messy/NN ./.
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT fish/JJ tacos/NNS the/DT most/RBS ,/, light/JJ and/CC crispy/NN ./.
Also/RB loved/VBD the/DT extensive/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN and/CC the/DT fact/NN there/EX is/VBZ cilantro/NN salsa/NN !/.
the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, the/DT service/NN is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ sometimes/NN ./.
in/IN fact/NN sometimes/IN the/DT service/NN kind/NN of/IN ruins/NNS the/DT experience/NN when/WRB i/JJ eat/NN in/IN so/RB i/JJ always/RB order/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
and/CC even/RB when/WRB i/JJ order/NN to/TO go/VB i/RB must/MD wait/VB 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN my/JJ food/NN ,/, even/RB at/IN times/NNS when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP not/RB too/RB busy/JJ ./.
i/NN have/VBP tried/VBN multiple/JJ times/NNS to/TO call/VB in/IN my/PRP$ order/NN ahead/RB of/IN time/NN so/IN i/JJ dont/NN waste/NN my/JJ time/NN with/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ,/, but/CC many/JJ times/NNS their/PRP$ phone/NN just/RB keeps/VBZ ringing/NN and/CC they/PRP never/RB answer/VBP it/PRP ./.
funny/JJ tho/NN ,/, because/IN when/WRB you/PRP walk/VBP up/RP to/TO the/DT counter/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ their/PRP$ phone/NN right/NN next/IN to/TO the/DT most/JJS encountered/JJ area/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
when/WRB i/JJ have/VBP the/DT patience/NN to/TO put/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN decent/NN service/NN here/RB ,/, i/NNP come/NNP and/CC enjoy/JJ some/DT good/JJ food/NN ./.
We/PRP really/VBP enjoy/JJ the/DT food/NN here/RB ,/, but/CC service/NN was/VBD poor/JJ due/JJ to/TO lack/NN of/IN adequate/JJ staff/NN ./.
They/PRP recently/RB expanded/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD sorely/RB needed/VBN ,/, but/CC appear/VB have/VBP failed/VBN to/TO hire/VB more/JJR staff/NN and/CC cooks/NNS ,/, which/WDT makes/NNS for/IN an/DT even/RB longer/JJ wait/NN than/IN usual/JJ ./.
Would/NNP give/VBD this/DT place/NN 5/VBD stars/NNS for/IN cuisine/NN ,/, 2/CD stars/NNS for/IN service/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD like/VB aknowledge/VB the/DT staff/NN in/IN service/NN since/IN they/PRP tried/VBP their/PRP$ best/NN ./.
Dude/NNP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ walking/VBG distance/NN from/IN my/PRP$ house/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ baaaad/JJ news/NN for/IN my/PRP$ thighs/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP driven/VBN past/JJ it/PRP multiple/JJ times/NNS and/CC it/PRP never/RB caught/VBD my/PRP$ eye/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP did/VBD notice/VB their/PRP$ large/JJ statue/NN thingy/NN outside/NN of/IN the/DT establishment/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD all/DT lit/NN up/IN as/IN I/PRP drove/VBP by/IN during/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP realized/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT gourmet/NN taco/NN shop/NN ,/, I/PRP knew/VBD I/PRP had/VBD to/TO go/VB asap/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN and/CC we/PRP both/VBP went/NNS to/TO TOWN/NNP on/IN their/PRP$ chips/NNS and/CC assorted/VBN salsas/NNS ./.
My/NNP favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT pecan/JJ salsa/NN ./.
Sweet/NNP and/CC spicy/NNP !/.
For/IN our/PRP$ meals/NNS ,/, he/PRP ordered/VBD 3/CD tacos/NNS and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP 2/RB ./.
The/DT pork/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD slightly/RB bland/JJ and/CC made/VBD me/PRP worry/VBD at/IN first/JJ that/IN I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB let/VBN down/RP ,/, but/CC then/RB came/VBD the/DT chicken/NN mole/NN taco/NN -/JJ oh/JJ my/NN !/.
Delicious/NNP !/.
Sweet/NNP and/CC savory/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD perfect/JJ ./.
I/PRP know/VBP that/IN sauce/NN is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO make/VB too/RB ,/, so/RB ,/, well/RB done/RB ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT tacos/NNS actually/RB do/VBP n't/RB come/VB with/IN cheese/NN -/JJ you/PRP know/VB why/WRB ?/.
Because/IN the/DT tacos/NNS are/VBP so/RB bomb/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB need/VB the/DT cheese/NN really/RB ./.
Their/PRP$ flavors/NNS are/VBP very/RB carefully/JJ picked/VBN to/TO taste/VB a/DT certain/JJ way/NN ./.
Save/NNP the/DT cheese/NN and/CC salsa/NN for/IN the/DT chips/NNS !/.
You/PRP 'll/MD enjoy/VB the/DT tacos/NNS just/RB as/IN they/PRP are/VBP ./.
YUM/NNP !/.
Great/JJ food/NN but/CC boy/NN .../: ../IN the/DT wait/NN to/TO get/VB served/VBN is/VBZ so/RB long/RB ./.
And/CC forget/JJ getting/NN your/NN appetizer/NN before/IN your/PRP$ entree/NN ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD 30/CD min/NN for/IN appetizer/NN only/RB ./.
If/IN they/PRP continue/VBP with/IN this/DT horrible/JJ service/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ they/PRP 'll/MD go/VB out/IN of/IN business/NN ,/, no/DT matter/NN if/IN they/PRP were/VBD featured/VBN in/IN Food/NNP network/NN ./.
Gon/NNP na/NNP keep/VB it/PRP short/-NONE- (/VBZ ish/JJ )/NNS and/CC simple/JJ today/NN ./.
Arrived/VBN at/IN 6PM/CD on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP ,/, and/CC to/TO say/VB that/IN parking/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB limited/VBN is/VBZ an/DT understatement/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, which/WDT explains/NNS why/VBD there/RB were/VBD n't/RB too/RB many/JJ parking/NN spots/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT 45/JJ minute/NN wait/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ for/IN two/CD so/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP takeout/JJ instead/NN ./.
A/DT little/JJ crammed/NN and/CC loud/NN with/IN people/NNS talking/VBG over/IN one/CD another/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD actually/RB pretty/RB cozy/JJ ./.
The/DT staff/NN were/VBD really/RB nice/JJ ,/, pleasant/JJ ,/, and/CC efficient/JJ even/RB with/IN the/DT crowd/NN and/CC gave/VBD us/PRP little/RB lids/VBZ for/IN the/DT salsa/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN our/PRP$ horchata/NN ,/, after/IN we/PRP placed/VBP our/VBN order/NN ./.
Fast/NNP forward/NN through/IN standing/NN around/IN awkwardly/RB in/IN what/WP felt/NNS like/IN everyone/NN 's/POS way/NN for/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD our/VBN burros/NNS in/IN hand/NN -/JJ an/DT Al/NNP Pastor/NNP burro/NN and/CC La/NNP Santisima/NNP burro/NN (/VBD chicken/VBN )/NN ./.
The/DT burros/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB sizable/JJ and/CC scrumptious/JJ ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ probably/RB what/WP sets/RB this/DT place/NN apart/NN from/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ fun/JJ and/CC most/JJS of/IN them/PRP have/VBP a/DT little/JJ kick/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, so/RB have/VBP a/DT glass/NN of/IN water/NN nearby/NN ./.
I/PRP loved/VBD their/PRP$ horchata/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ sweeter/NN than/IN other/JJ horchatas/NNS ,/, has/VBZ more/JJR cinnamon/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT fruits/NNS (/VBP strawberries/NNS )/NNS are/VBP a/DT great/JJ touch/NN ./.
Definitely/NNP will/MD be/VB back/RB ,/, probably/RB for/IN takeout/NN ./.
My/NNP co-worker/NN walked/VBD in/IN from/IN lunch/NN the/DT other/JJ day/NN with/IN their/PRP$ horchata/NN and/CC I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT bit/NN I/PRP had/VBD so/RB much/RB I/PRP demanded/VBD to/TO know/VB where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD from/IN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD a/DT bit/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO get/VB used/NN to/TO the/DT sheer/NN number/NN of/IN salsas/NNS they/PRP had/VBD available/JJ ,/, but/CC once/RB I/PRP got/VBD comfortable/JJ trying/VBG things/NNS (/IN I/PRP was/VBD afraid/JJ I/PRP might/MD burn/VB my/PRP$ tongue/NN off/IN accidentally/RB )/JJ I/PRP was/VBD hooked/VBN !/.
I/PRP 'd/VBP recommend/VB the/DT peanut/NN salsa/NN to/TO anyone/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD some/DT seriously/RB good/JJ sauce/NN ./.
Wow/NNP !/.
I/PRP was/VBD pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN when/WRB I/PRP stepped/VBD into/IN this/DT joint/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN was/VBD fun/JJ ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD super/NN clean/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD so/RB great/JJ !/.
I/PRP am/VBP so/RB excited/VBN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ within/IN walking/VBG distance/NN of/IN my/PRP$ home/NN ./.
YOU/NNP MUST/NNP TRY/NNP THE/NNP HORCHATA/NNP !/.
It/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN 's/POS except/NN better/NN ./.

Yes/NNS !/.
I/PRP swear/VBP to/TO little/JJ baby/NN Jesus/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS horchata/NN in/IN the/DT universe/NN ./.
The/DT Cochinita/NNP Pibil/NNP taco/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, the/DT mole/NN chicken/NN taco/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN was/VBD killer/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD 5/CD or/CC 6/CD and/CC they/PRP were/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC uniquely/RB flavored/VBN ./.
The/DT best/JJS part/NN ?/.
Three/JJ people/NNS ate/VBP for/IN 20/CD bucks/NNS !/.
I/PRP could/MD have/VB eaten/VBN cheaper/IN if/IN I/PRP had/VBD not/RB gotten/VBN the/DT plate/NN ./.
I/PRP took/VBD half/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN home/NN ,/, if/IN that/DT is/VBZ any/DT sign/NN of/IN the/DT healthy/JJ (/NN but/CC not/RB overly/RB large/JJ )/NNS portions/NNS here/RB ./.

I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT shrimp/NN and/CC carnitas/VBZ tacos/NNS (/IN both/DT delicious/JJ !/NN )/.
and/CC washed/VBD it/PRP down/IN with/IN an/DT ice-cold/JJ Mexican/NNP Coke/NNP (/VBD the/DT only/RB soda/JJ I/PRP 'll/MD drink/VB )/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ GREAT/NNP -/JJ variety/NN ./.
The/DT walls/NNS are/VBP covered/VBN with/IN local/JJ art/NN ./.
Con/NNP :/: There/EX is/VBZ nowhere/RB to/TO wait/VB if/IN the/DT modest/NN sized/VBD restaurant/NN is/VBZ full/JJ ./.
No/DT one/CD wants/NN to/TO wait/VB in/IN the/DT heat/NN during/IN the/DT summer/NN ./.
Well/NNP we/PRP went/VBD back/RB just/RB to/TO check/NN and/CC ,/, sure/JJ enough/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ still/RB the/DT best/JJS mexican/JJ food/NN we/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
My/NNP taco/NN with/IN pork/JJ cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT banana/NN leaf/NN was/VBD uh-mA-zing/JJ ./.

I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP just/RB gained/VBD five/CD pounds/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP go/VBP ,/, do/VBP the/DT carne/NN asada/NN tacos/NNS ./.

She/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT executive/JJ chef/NN and/CC is/VBZ madly/RB in/IN love/JJ with/IN Guy/NNP Fieri/NNP ./.
When/WRB she/PRP saw/VBD the/DT autographed/JJ poster/NN she/PRP instinctively/RB tried/VBD to/TO climb/NN on/IN the/DT table/JJ and/CC smell/JJ it/PRP ./.
I/PRP think/VBP she/PRP even/RB tried/VBD to/TO lick/NN it/PRP ./.
After/IN the/DT manager/NN had/VBD to/TO threaten/VBN to/TO call/VB the/DT cops/NNS she/PRP settled/VBD down/RB and/CC after/IN the/DT shakes/NNS and/CC sweats/NNS stopped/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT best/JJS damn/NN tacos/NNS we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN in/IN a/DT loooong/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN kicks/VBZ ass/NN and/CC we/PRP mixed/VBP a/DT few/JJ together/NN to/TO get/VB even/RB better/RBR sauces/NNS ./.
I/PRP do/VBP recommend/RB this/DT place/NN to/TO everyone/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB Guy/JJ Fieri/NNP ./.
He/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT dick/NN and/CC almost/RB ruined/VBN our/PRP$ vacation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT superlative/JJ bean/NN and/CC cheese/NN burrito/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP !/.
Classic/NNP taste/NN and/CC the/DT refried/JJ beans/NNS are/VBP not/RB cooked/VBN in/IN lard/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ nice/JJ for/IN vegetarians/NNS to/TO know/VB and/CC whatever/VB oils/NNS they/PRP use/VBP give/VBP them/PRP a/DT good/JJ savory/NN taste/NN ./.
No/DT bland/NN beans/VBZ here/RB !/.
If/IN dairy/NN is/VBZ not/RB your/JJ thing/NN ,/, the/DT Ghandi/NNP Vegan/NNP burrito/NN has/VBZ fresh/JJ guacamole/NN and/CC black/NN beans/NNS matched/VBD by/IN no/DT other/JJ ./.
And/CC if/IN the/DT entrees/NNS were/VBD n't/RB enough/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ also/RB THE/NNP best/NNP salsa/NNP bar/NN of/IN all/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT red/VBD chipotle/NN salsa/NN must/MD have/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN addictive/JJ substance/NN in/IN it/PRP ,/, as/IN I/PRP can/MD not/RB stop/VB at/IN just/RB two/CD servings/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ top/JJ notch/NN and/CC the/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ mellow/NN ./.
My/NNP only/RB issue/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ kinda/NN hard/NN to/TO see/VB from/IN the/DT road/NN ./.

Best/NNP horchata/NN EVER/NNP !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT huge/JJ variety/NN to/TO try/NN ./.
The/DT shark/NN dog/NN fish/JJ tacos/NNS are/VBP great/JJ .../: a/DT MUST/NNP try/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ somewhat/JJ small/JJ ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP come/VBP at/IN the/DT right/JJ time/NN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT wait/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD this/DT joint/JJ simply/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT great/JJ reviews/NNS on/IN yelp/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ an/DT awesome/NN salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD helpful/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN alone/NN was/VBD worth/IN the/DT trip/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD just/RB so/RB many/JJ wonderful/JJ elements/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT steak/JJ and/CC bean/JJ burro/NN ./.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD seasoned/VBN perfectly/RB and/CC had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ crust/NN of/IN season/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT horchata/NN is/VBZ seriously/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO take/VB everyone/NN I/PRP know/VBP to/TO this/DT great/JJ spot/NN ./.
Enjoy/NNP !/.
Place/NNP is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ overrated/VBN ./.
Good/NNP salsa/NN bar/NN but/CC tortillas/NN for/IN the/DT tacos/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB average/JJ and/CC the/DT meat/NN on/IN the/DT arrachera/NN tacos/VBZ not/RB particularly/RB tender/JJ ./.
The/DT fish/JJ tacos/NNS were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
Based/VBN on/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB happily/RB given/VBN La/NNP Condesa/NNP a/DT 4/NN star/NN review/NN ./.
My/NNP veggie/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD delicious/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP loved/VBD all/PDT the/DT fun/JJ salsas/NNS ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB get/VB enough/RB of/IN them/PRP !/.
Really/RB ,/, the/DT only/JJ negative/NN was/VBD the/DT cramped/JJ quarters/NNS ./.
My/NNP second/NNP visit/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, was/VBD not/RB nearly/RB as/RB good/JJ ./.
On/IN the/DT positive/JJ side/NN ,/, I/PRP got/VBD guacamole/JJ this/DT time/NN which/WDT was/VBD studded/VBN with/IN dried/JJ cranberries/NNS and/CC tasted/VBN great/JJ with/IN the/DT strawberry/JJ salsa/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT service/NN too/RB because/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN 's/POS order/NN came/VBD out/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN mine/JJ despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP separately/RB 10/CD minutes/NNS apart/RB ./.
The/DT tacos/NNS this/DT time/NN were/VBD awful/JJ ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT vegan/NN tacos/NNS since/IN the/DT description/NN of/IN ``/`` no/DT pintos/NNS ,/, no/DT rice/NN ''/'' lead/NN me/PRP to/TO believe/VB that/IN the/DT beans/NNS and/CC rice/NN in/IN the/DT veggie/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD n't/RB really/RB vegetarian/JJ friendly/RB ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT pretty/RB strict/JJ vegetarian/JJ so/IN I/PRP try/VBP to/TO avoid/VB food/NN that/IN 's/VBZ been/VBN prepared/VBN with/IN meat-based/JJ stock/NN ./.
The/DT vegan/JJ tacos/NNS come/VBP with/IN black/NN beans/NNS which/WDT were/VBD absolutely/RB flavorless/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ these/DT beans/NNS encountered/VBD even/RB a/DT grain/NN of/IN salt/NN during/IN their/PRP$ preparation/NN ./.
The/DT tacos/NNS also/RB had/VBD iceburg/VBN lettuce/NN in/IN them/PRP which/WDT tasted/VBN dreadful/JJ of/IN course/NN ./.
So/IN now/RB I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB have/VB their/PRP$ veggie/NN tacos/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT vegan/JJ ones/NNS suck/NN ./.
No/DT reason/NN to/TO visit/NN again/RB ./.
Hands/NNP down/NNP yum/NN and/CC fave/VB taco/NN place/NN in/IN town/NN !/NN !/VBD !/RB !/JJ !/.
Have/NNP n't/RB tried/VBD the/DT burros/NNS as/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN love/NN with/IN the/DT tacos/NNS .../: Love/NNP love/VB the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN as/IN well/RB !/.
Cute/NNP inside/NN ,/, nothing/NN fancy/NN and/CC a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO take/VB friends/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP like/IN barrio/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD love/VB la/NN condesa/NN (/NN so/RB will/MD your/VB wallet/NN )/NNS ./.

I/PRP will/MD go/VB back/RB for/IN sure/JJ !/.
The/DT guacamole/JJ salsa/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG !/NN !/.
!/NN
First/NNP i/NNP wanted/VBD a/DT quesadilla/NN and/CC they/PRP didnt/VBP have/VBP any/DT cheese/NN and/CC then/RB the/DT waitress/NN skiped/VBD our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC gave/JJ food/NN to/TO 2/CD other/JJ tables/NNS that/WDT got/IN there/EX after/IN us../NN never/RB going/VBG back../NN
Not/RB a/DT fan/JJ ./.
We/PRP waited/VBD 15/CD minutes/NNS for/IN a/DT table/JJ when/WRB the/DT place/NN was/VBD practically/RB empty/JJ ./.
They/PRP sat/VBP us/PRP next/JJ to/TO the/DT hot/NN window/NN (/VBD triple-digit/JJ hot/NN day/NN )/NN when/WRB there/EX was/VBD plenty/NN of/IN open/JJ tables/NNS all/DT over/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT guacamole/NN was/VBD weird/JJ (/NN cranberries/NNS in/IN guac/JJ ?/NN )/.
and/CC I/PRP hate/VB those/DT salsa/NN bars/VBZ that/IN give/NN you/PRP those/DT tiny/NN plastic/JJ containers/NNS that/WDT are/VBP too/RB small/JJ for/IN you/PRP to/TO dip/VB your/PRP$ chips/NNS into/IN ./.
The/DT margaritas/NN and/CC tacos/NNS were/VBD good/JJ though/NN ./.
Just/NNP a/DT warning/NN .../: do/VBP n't/RB get/VB the/DT three/CD taco/NN plate/NN .../: it/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB much/JJ food/NN ./.
One/CD taco/NN was/VBD enough/RB with/IN the/DT beans/NNS and/CC rice/NN ./.
Nice/NNP variety/NN of/IN salsas/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN tacos/NNS and/CC they/PRP were/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ very/RB small/JJ and/CC only/RB had/VBD two/CD servers/NNS for/IN dinner/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD nice/JJ though/IN ./.
I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB return/VB ./.
As/IN someone/NN who/WP 's/POS travels/NNS to/TO Southern/NNP California/NNP a/DT few/JJ times/NNS a/DT year/NN ,/, I/PRP sort/VBP of/IN know/NN my/IN Mexican/NNP food/NN especially/RB as/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO street/NN tacos/NNS and/CC such/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP admit/RB this/DT place/NN has/VBZ more/VBN protein/NN for/IN your/PRP$ tacos/NNS than/IN any/DT other/JJ Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN in/IN ./.
It/PRP can/MD also/RB be/VB overwhelming/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN choices/NNS but/CC at/IN $/$ 3.99-/CD $/$ 6.50/CD for/IN a/DT single/JJ taco/NN ,/, the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB high/JJ so/IN I/PRP had/VBD some/DT high/JJ expectations/NNS ./.
What/WP I/PRP can/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN the/DT al/JJ pastor/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD dry/JJ ,/, in/IN fact/NN tasted/VBD like/IN tree/NN bark/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN texture/NN ./.
The/DT braised/VBD pork/NN was/VBD good/JJ though/NN but/CC the/DT tortas/NNS were/VBD very/RB interesting/JJ ,/, it/PRP came/VBD out/RP on/IN a/DT toasted/VBN French/JJ baguette/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO put/VBN quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN salsa/NN in/IN it/PRP to/TO moisten/VB it/PRP up/IN due/JJ to/TO it/PRP again/RB being/VBG very/RB dry/JJ ./.
Imagine/NNP dry/VBD meat/NN on/IN a/DT toasted/VBN French/JJ baguette/NN ./.
What/WP I/PRP believe/VBP does/VBZ set/VB this/DT place/NN apart/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ amazing/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ self/JJ serve/NN and/CC unlimited/JJ ./.
You/PRP get/VBP your/VBN first/JJ bowl/NN of/IN chips/NNS on/IN the/DT house/NN ,/, refills/NNS are/VBP $/$ 2.70/CD ./.
The/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/IN stood/NN out/NN was/VBD the/DT horchata/NN ,/, it/PRP had/VBD fresh/JJ ground/NN cinnamon/NN ,/, some/DT oats/NNS and/CC bits/NNS of/IN strawberries/NNS on/IN the/DT bottom/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB interesting/JJ ,/, but/CC nonetheless/JJ ,/, was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
We/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT strawberry/JJ margarita/NN ,/, tasted/VBD more/RBR like/IN sugar/NN water/NN with/IN a/DT half/JJ shot/NN of/IN a/DT tequila/NN and/CC very/RB very/RB sweet/JJ ./.
I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT strawberry/JJ margarita/NN was/VBD $/$ 9.00/CD ,/, so/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ high/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP ever/VBP go/JJ back/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP 'll/MD stick/VB with/IN the/DT horchata/NN instead/RB of/IN their/PRP$ margaritas/NNS ./.
They/PRP said/VBD an/DT hour/NN wait/NN for/IN two/CD ,/, we/PRP waited/VBD outside/NN for/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS and/CC was/VBD called/VBN ,/, so/RB at/IN least/JJS that/IN 's/POS nice/NN ./.
A/DT tip/NN is/VBZ to/TO write/VB your/PRP$ name/NN ,/, party/NN size/NN and/CC phone/NN number/NN on/IN the/DT waiting/NN list/NN ,/, they/PRP will/MD call/VB you/PRP when/WRB your/JJ table/NN is/VBZ ready/NN ./.
And/CC no/DT waiting/NN inside/NN either/NN ,/, all/DT waiting/NN is/VBZ outside/RB ./.
``/`` Oh/NNP wow/NN ,/, what/WP did/VBD I/PRP get/VB myself/JJ into/IN ?/. ''/''
was/IN all/DT I/PRP thought/VBP as/IN I/PRP pulled/VBD up/RP to/TO La/NNP Condesa/NNP ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB familiar/JJ with/IN Phoenix/NNP or/CC the/DT surrounding/NN neighborhoods/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ taken/NN aback/NN at/IN first/JJ ./.
The/DT business/NN looks/VBZ like/IN an/DT old/JJ house/NN ,/, as/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT businesses/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN do/VBP ,/, i/VB noticed/JJ lots/NNS of/IN bars/NNS on/IN the/DT windows/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT business/NN signs/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN were/VBD in/IN Spanish/JJ ./.
THE/NNP ONLY/NNP reason/NNP I/PRP noticed/VBD this/DT is/VBZ because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP unfamiliar/JJ with/IN Phoenix/NNP and/CC was/VBD traveling/VBG alone/RB ./.
First/NNP impression/NN ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ tiny/NN !/.
I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN at/IN capacity/NN ,/, the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB loud/JJ and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT difficult/JJ time/NN hearing/NN my/NN server/NN ./.
The/DT tables/NNS were/VBD very/RB close/JJ together/NN ,/, all/PDT the/DT chairs/NNS were/VBD mismatched/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT lighting/NN was/VBD really/RB dim/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB to/TO the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN where/WRB they/PRP put/VBP the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
The/DT house/NN margaritas/VBZ were/VBD made/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ grapefruit/NN and/CC lime/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT was/VBD perfect/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN burro/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB sloppy/JJ ./.
It/PRP melted/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT sleeve/NN and/CC fell/VBD apart/NN while/IN I/PRP was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO eat/VB it/PRP ./.
Plus/RB ,/, some/DT of/IN the/DT tails/NNS were/VBD left/VBN on/IN the/DT shrimp/NN .../: let/NN me/PRP tell/VBP you/PRP about/IN shocking/NN !/.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD sub-par/JJ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
My/NNP server/NN was/VBD inattentive/JJ and/CC did/VBD n't/RB ask/VB how/WRB my/JJ food/NN was/VBD ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO flag/NN down/IN the/DT server/NN like/IN an/DT air/NN traffic/NN controller/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ bill/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP took/VBD a/DT while/NN to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ bill/NN back/RB ./.
This/DT one/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT revisit/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
A/DT truly/NN great/NN casual/JJ and/CC authentic/JJ Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN with/IN a/DT gourmet/NN twist/NN ./.
La/NNP Santisima/NNP sports/VBZ great/JJ artwork/NN on/IN the/DT interior/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN with/IN a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN interesting/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ ,/, unique/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ ./.
Less/NNP traditional/NNP ,/, but/CC flavorful/JJ and/CC satisfying/JJ ./.
So/RB are/VBP the/DT portions/NNS ./.
My/NNP friend/NN raved/VBD about/IN it/PRP so/RB I/PRP thought/VBD I/PRP 'd/MD try/VB it/PRP ./.
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, the/DT place/NN is/VBZ SMALL/NNP ./.
luckily/RB we/PRP got/VBD there/RB right/RB when/WRB they/PRP opened/VBP ./.
Seemed/NNP like/IN as/RB soon/RB as/IN we/PRP got/VBD seated/VBN ,/, the/DT place/NN started/VBD to/TO fill/NN up/IN ./.
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN and/CC the/DT different/JJ assortment/NN of/IN salsas/NNS ./.
As/IN for/IN my/PRP$ actual/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB care/VB for/IN it/PRP much/RB ./.
To/TO me/PRP ,/, it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB much/JJ of/IN a/DT flavor/NN to/TO it/PRP unless/IN it/PRP was/VBD drowned/VBN in/IN the/DT salsa/NN from/IN the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
Was/NNP going/VBD to/TO order/VB a/DT strawberry/JJ horchata/NN to/TO go/VB but/CC every/DT time/NN we/PRP asked/VBD for/IN something/NN ,/, the/DT waitress/NN took/VBD a/DT while/NN to/TO come/VB back/RB (/VBN she/PRP only/RB came/VBD back/RB in/IN a/DT hurry/NN when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD time/NN to/TO pick/VB up/RP the/DT money/NN )/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP said/VBD forget/JJ it/PRP ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/VBN but/CC at/IN least/JJS I/PRP can/MD say/VB I/PRP went/VBD ./.
Saw/NNP this/DT restaurant/NN on/IN diners/NNS ,/, drive-ins/NNS and/CC dives/NNS and/CC am/VB so/RB glad/JJ we/PRP stopped/VBP here/RB !/.
We/PRP are/VBP in/IN town/NN for/IN 2/CD days/NNS from/IN Miami/NNP ,/, on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN to/TO Sedona/NNP !/.

I/PRP interpret/VBP that/DT plaque/NN as/IN something/NN having/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN ``/`` low/JJ prices/NNS ''/'' however/RB ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN the/DT restaurant/NN totally/RB moved/VBD away/RB from/IN low/JJ cost/NN !/.

the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN does/VBZ have/VB great/JJ salsas/NNS but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP watered/VBN down/IN .../: it/PRP ca/MD n't/RB even/RB be/VB scooped/VBN ,/, you/PRP can/MD only/RB ``/`` wet/JJ ''/'' your/NN chips/NNS in/IN it/PRP and/CC if/IN you/PRP add/VBP it/PRP to/TO your/VB food/NN be/VB ready/NN for/IN your/PRP$ tortilla/NN or/CC lonche/NN to/TO fall/VB apart/NN .../: they/PRP might/MD as/RB well/RB serve/VB the/DT salsa/NN on/IN a/DT cup/NN with/IN a/DT straw/NN so/IN you/PRP can/MD sip/VB on/IN it/PRP as/IN you/PRP eat/VBP !/.

I/PRP wish/VBP there/RB was/VBD one/CD in/IN California/NNP ./.
P.S-/NNP Everyone/NNP around/IN us/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT quesadilla/NN because/IN they/PRP are/VBP stuffed/VBN inside/JJ their/PRP$ homemade/NN tortillas/NNS and/CC deep/VB fried/JJ ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB and/CC try/RB these/DT ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ ,/, too/RB !/.
i/NN have/VBP been/VBN to/TO this/DT place/NN a/DT few/JJ times/NNS now../NN in/IN the/DT beginning/NN it/PRP was/VBD amazing/VBG but/CC last/JJ time/NN i/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ disappointed/JJ ./.
the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN has/VBZ lots/NNS of/IN great/JJ flavors/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT best/NN was/VBD the/DT guacamole/JJ which/NN used/NN to/TO be/VB free/JJ ./.
now/RB they/PRP charge/VBD $/$ 3.75/CD for/IN a/DT tiny/NN container../NN !/.
the/DT quesa/NN (/VBD although/IN tasty/NN )/NN can/MD be/VB VERY/NNP greasy../NN took/VBD it/PRP to/TO go/VB last/JJ time/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD literally/RB swimming/VBG in/IN the/DT container/NN by/IN the/DT time/NN i/NN got/VBD it/PRP home/-NONE- ./.
the/DT art/NN on/IN the/DT walls/NNS and/CC bathroom/NN doors/NNS is/VBZ lovely/RB and/CC tricks/VBZ me/PRP into/IN liking/VBG the/DT place/NN more/RBR than/IN i/NN would/MD otherwise/VB ,/, i/NNP think/NNP ./.
not/RB bad../NN but/CC not/RB good/JJ ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD ok/JJ .../:
Parking/NNP was/VBD slim/JJ ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD space/NN on/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ ,/, friendly/RB place../NN small/JJ ,/, but/CC welcoming/VBG to/TO our/PRP$ large/JJ group/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN was/VBD nice/JJ ./.
There/EX were/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN different/JJ ones/NNS to/TO choose/VB from/IN and/CC everyone/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO find/NN ones/NNS that/IN they/PRP enjoyed/VBD ./.
The/DT chips/NNS were/VBD free/JJ (/JJ there/NNS were/VBD some/DT reviews/NNS saying/VBG they/PRP were/VBD charged/VBN for/IN chips../NN )/NN i/NN had/VBD the/DT taco/burro/NN combo../NN
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN taco/NN and/CC the/DT gaucho/NN steak/NN burro/NN ./.
The/DT shrimp/NN had/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN breading/NN ./.
It/PRP had/VBD good/JJ flavor/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT shrimp/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB found/VBD that/IN the/DT steak/NN in/IN my/PRP$ burro/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/NN ./.
Again/NNP ,/, it/PRP had/VBD good/JJ flavor/NN ,/, but/CC i/NN was/VBD disappointed/VBN in/IN the/DT meat/NN ./.
The/DT grilled/JJ squash/NN that/WDT came/NNS with/IN the/DT plate/NN was/VBD good/JJ though/IN !/.
I/PRP decided/VBD that/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT horchata/NN because/IN of/IN all/PDT the/DT reviews/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB care/VB for/IN the/DT chunks/NNS of/IN fruit/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD difficult/JJ to/TO drink/NN through/IN the/DT straw/JJ towards/NNS the/DT end/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP wasting/VBG 1/4/CD of/IN my/PRP$ $/$ 4/CD drink/VBP .../: Pricing/NNP is/VBZ higher/JJR than/IN noted/CD ./.
My/NNP plate/NN was/VBD $/$ 12ish/CD and/CC the/DT horchata/NN was/VBD $/$ 4/CD ./.
After/IN tax/NN and/CC tip/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD over/IN $/$ 20/CD ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT decent/JJ meal/experience/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB go/VB back/RB ./.
Love/NNP the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN with/IN so/RB many/JJ different/JJ varieties/NNS from/IN sweet/JJ and/CC fruity/NN to/TO hot/NN and/CC juicy/NN
Diner/NNP 's/POS Drive-ins/NNP and/CC Dives/NNP location/NN .../: known/NN for/IN their/PRP$ tacos/NNS and/CC salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD tasty/JJ and/CC the/DT prices/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ basically/RB counter/JJ service/NN ,/, but/CC good/JJ ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO move/VB quickly/RB ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB be/VB surprised/VBN with/IN a/DT wait/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
Make/NNP sure/VBD to/TO try/NNS as/IN many/JJ salsas/NNS as/IN you/PRP can/MD ./.
The/DT tacos/NNS were/VBD very/RB good/JJ -/NN I/PRP had/VBD very/RB high/JJ expectations/NNS ,/, and/CC while/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB blown/JJ away/RB ,/, they/PRP were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
So/IN I/PRP went/VBD to/TO lunch/NN here/RB on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP and/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD full/JJ ,/, but/CC then/RB again/RB it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB all/DT that/DT big/JJ ./.
The/DT interior/NN is/VBZ fairly/RB nice/JJ for/IN a/DT Mexican/JJ food/NN joint/NNS and/CC what/WP first/JJ caught/NN my/NN eye/NN was/VBD the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
At/IN least/JJS 10/CD different/JJ kind/NN of/IN salsas/NNS for/IN the/DT taking/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ omen/NN ./.
Gourmet/NNP Taco/NNP 's/POS feels/NNS incredibly/RB insincere/VBP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ like/IN when/WRB MacDonald/NNP 's/POS have/VBP ``/`` a/DT la/NN carte/NN ''/'' on/IN the/DT to/NN of/IN their/PRP$ back/JJ lit/NN wall/NN menu/NN ./.
It/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT joke/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT shrimp/NN tacos/VBZ that/IN comes/NN when/WRB ordering/VBG some/DT cheesy/NN slur/NN that/IN most/JJS surely/RB contains/VBZ the/DT words/NNS 'baja/NNS '/POS or/CC 'cabo/NNS '/POS or/CC something/NN silly/RB to/TO that/DT nature/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT horchata/NN to/TO go/VB with/IN my/PRP$ lunch/NN ./.
The/DT order/NN is/VBZ two/CD decently/RB filled/VBN tacos/NNS with/IN both/DT double/JJ corn/NN tortillas/NNS ./.
The/DT shrimp/NN was/VBD n't/RB the/DT long/JJ monster/NN that/IN I/PRP expected/VBP but/CC instead/RB three/CD minor/NN in/IN each/DT taco/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD OK./NNP Then/NNP it/PRP was/VBD filled/VBN with/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN cabbagy/NN mass/NN that/WDT was/VBD completely/RB raw/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ -/JJ but/CC would/MD look/VB good/JJ on/IN a/DT picture/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD not/RB OK/RB -/JJ tasteless/NN filler/NN is/VBZ pointless/NN ./.
The/DT horchata/NN was/VBD tasty/JJ ,/, but/CC way/NN too/RB much/JJ ice/NN in/IN the/DT glass/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB -/JJ they/PRP have/VBP hot/VBN and/CC mild/NN and/CC spicy/NN and/CC seasonal/JJ ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN some/DT strawberry/JJ salsa/NN that/WDT was/VBD strangely/RB tangy/JJ ./.
But/CC I/PRP love/VBP the/DT variety/NN ./.
I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT food/NN ./.
Not/RB all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ party/NN did/VBD enjoy/VB their/PRP$ meal/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD ./.
But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB pricey/JJ for/IN Mexican/NNP food../NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB that/DT spectacular/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT price/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT discouragement/NN for/IN me/PRP ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO my/PRP$ return/NN factor/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN better/VBN tacos/NNS for/IN cheaper/JJR ./.
that/DT is/VBZ the/DT bottom/NN line/NN -/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ ./.
Not/RB at/IN all/DT ./.
In/IN summary/JJ ;/: meal/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC too/RB expensive/JJ ./.
Oh/NNP My/NNP Goodness/NNP !/NNP !/.

I/PRP love/VBP the/DT food/NN here/RB ,/, ans/NNS their/PRP$ salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ always/RB kept/JJ stocked/JJ and/CC clean/JJ ./.
Every/NNP time/NN I/PRP have/VBP visited/VBN the/DT restaurant/NN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT wait/JJ time/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ worth/IN it/PRP ./.
Portions/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB well/RB for/IN price/NN of/IN food/NN (/NN which/WDT is/VBZ reasonable/JJ )/NN ./.
I/PRP live/VBP closer/NN to/TO their/PRP$ location/NN in/IN Glendale/NNP but/CC will/MD rather/RB drive/VB to/TO this/DT location/NN due/JJ to/TO better/JJR service/NN ,/, food/NN and/CC cleanliness/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB because/IN my/PRP$ coworkers/NNS were/VBD all/DT talking/VBG about/IN how/WRB good/JJ this/DT place/NN was/VBD ./.
I/PRP also/RB heard/VBD that/IN they/PRP had/VBD shark/VBN tacos/NNS that/IN my/PRP$ bf/NN really/RB wanted/VBD to/TO try/NNP ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ super/NN small/JJ and/CC kind/JJ of/IN divey/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN for/IN you/PRP to/TO enjoy/VB when/WRB you/PRP first/RB sit/JJ down/IN ./.
The/DT strawberry/JJ salsa/NN was/VBD my/JJ favorite/NN ./.
Sweet/NNP but/CC a/DT little/JJ bit/NN spicy/NN ./.
They/PRP definitely/RB get/VBP you/PRP on/IN the/DT chips/NNS though/RB because/IN there/EX are/VBP no/DT free/JJ refills/NNS like/IN most/JJS other/JJ places/NNS ./.
Another/DT basket/NN of/IN chips/NNS is/VBZ almost/RB $/$ 3/CD ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT chicken/NN mole/NN quesadilla/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ quesadillas/NNS are/VBP definitely/RB not/RB like/IN your/PRP$ typical/JJ quesadilla/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ almost/RB like/IN a/DT deep/NN fried/VBN calzone/NN ./.
The/DT portion/NN is/VBZ huge/JJ though/IN ,/, I/PRP could/MD only/RB eat/VB half/DT of/IN it/PRP ./.
My/NNP bf/NN got/VBD one/CD shark/NN taco/NN to/TO try/VB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN disappointing/NN ./.
It/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN cod/NN and/CC there/EX was/VBD n't/RB very/RB much/JJ flavoring/NN ./.
The/DT taco/NN just/RB came/VBD with/IN a/DT tiny/NN bit/NN of/IN lettuce/NN and/CC some/DT green/JJ sauce/NN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD the/DT guacamole/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
They/PRP put/VBD raisins/NNS and/CC some/DT other/JJ fruit/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
At/IN first/JJ it/PRP sounds/VBZ strange/JJ but/CC trust/RB me/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ./.
Wish/NNP we/PRP saved/VBD some/DT chips/NNS to/TO eat/VB with/IN it/PRP since/IN we/PRP ate/VBP most/JJS of/IN it/PRP with/IN the/DT salsa/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB and/CC the/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP pretty/RB quick/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ we/PRP tried/VBP it/PRP out/IN but/CC do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN I/PRP would/MD be/VB dying/VBG to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
Food/NNP and/CC drinks/VBZ were/VBD amazing..I/RB enjoyed/VBN the/DT black/NN mole`/NN taco/NN ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN had/VBD a/DT variety/NN of/IN flavors/NNS and/CC spices/NNS .../: The/DT guacamole/NN was/VBD rediculously/RB hot/NN ,/, but/CC yummy/JJ !/.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ rough/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD very/RB busy/JJ and/CC i/JJ think/NN they/PRP were/VBD understaffed/VBN ./.
They/PRP forgot/VBP to/TO set/VB our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC once/RB served/VBD did/VBD not/RB come/VB around/RB often/RB to/TO check/NN on/IN us/PRP ./.
If/IN you/PRP dont/VBP mind/JJ waiting/NN and/CC sub/NN par/NN service/NN come/VBD check/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN .../: The/DT good/JJ food/NN definitely/RB outweighs/VBZ the/DT bad/JJ service/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC salsa/NN were/VBD n't/RB off/IN the/DT hook/NN incredible/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN just/RB 1/CD star/NN ./.
Apparently/RB I/PRP went/VBD to/TO LCGTS/NNP on/IN a/DT really/RB bad/JJ night/NN ./.
But/CC they/PRP pulled/VBD off/RP a/DT tasty/NN miracle/NN ./.
My/NNP pal/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD to/TO LCGTS/NNP on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN to/TO see/VB Cheech/NNP and/CC Chong/NNP at/IN the/DT Dodge/NNP Theater/NNP ./.
So/IN we/PRP were/VBD up/RB for/IN some/DT good/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN munchies/NNS ./.
We/PRP walk/VBP in/IN and/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT line/NN .../: okay/NN no/DT big/JJ deal/NN ./.
BUT/NNP there/EX were/VBD no/DT forks/NNS (/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO eat/VB with/IN spoons/NNS and/CC fingers/NNS )/RB ./.
There/EX were/VBD no/DT napkins/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN was/VBD bone/JJ dry/NN ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT salsa/NN trays/NNS looked/VBD like/IN they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN licked/VBN clean/NN by/IN a/DT starving/JJ dog/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO replenish/VB the/DT salsa/NN but/CC they/PRP completely/RB ran/VBD out/IN of/IN forks/NNS ./.
We/PRP got/VBD no/DT chips/NNS and/CC no/DT drinks/NNS ./.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO beg/VB the/DT poor/NN ,/, nice/JJ girl/NN who/WP was/VBD completely/RB stressed/VBN out/RP ./.
They/PRP were/VBD a/DT tad/JJ understaffed/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT ``/`` trip/NN ''/'' ./.
But/CC somehow/IN they/PRP managed/VBP to/TO bring/VB out/RP my/PRP$ dish/JJ .../NN ./. a/DT Chicken/NNP Mole/NNP burrito/NN and/CC a/DT Carne/NNP Asada/NNP Steak/NNP taco/NN ./.
OMG/NNP were/VBD they/PRP amazing/VBP ./.
The/DT flavors/NNS of/IN those/DT dishes/NNS and/CC the/DT flavors/NNS of/IN the/DT AMAZING/NNP salsa/NN were/VBD just/RB super/JJR ./.
The/DT meat/NN in/IN that/DT taco/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/NN ./.
Crusty/NNP bits/NNS of/IN steak/NN that/IN had/VBD a/DT crunchy/JJ sear/NN but/CC were/VBD still/RB very/RB tender/VBN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB mind/VB not/RB having/VBG a/DT fork/NN ./.
While/IN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, they/PRP LOCKED/VBP the/DT door/NN ,/, just/RB like/IN Cheech/NNP Marin/NNP did/VBD in/IN the/DT Vampire/NNP den/NN in/IN ``/`` From/NNP Dusk/NNP till/NN Dawn/NNP ''/'' ./.
We/PRP were/VBD locked/VBN in/IN as/IN prisoners/NNS ./.
Apparently/RB they/PRP were/VBD closing/VBN down/RP at/IN 6:45/CD p.m./NN due/JJ to/TO being/VBG understaffed/VBN and/CC not/RB having/VB forks/NNS or/CC more/JJR salsa/NN ./.
Luckily/RB ,/, my/PRP$ buddy/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD the/DT last/JJ people/NNS to/TO be/VB served/VBN ./.
I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB go/VB back/RB ./.
Delish/NNP ./.

Packed/NNP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD so/RB impressed/VBN with/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC so/RB surprised/VBD we/PRP had/VBD never/VBN heard/NN of/IN it/PRP !/.
Salsa/NNP :/: There/NNS are/VBP something/NN like/IN 20/CD different/JJ salsa/NN to/TO choose/VB from/IN in/IN their/PRP$ salsa/NN bar/NN but/CC our/PRP$ favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT salsa/NN mexicana/NN which/WDT was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC garlicky/JJ with/IN chopped/VBN cilantro/NN ./.
You/PRP scoop/VBP the/DT salsas/NNS into/IN little/JJ plastic/JJ containers/NNS similar/JJ to/TO what/WP you/PRP 'd/MD find/VB in/IN a/DT taqueria/NN but/CC this/DT is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT cloth/NN napkin/NN type/NN of/IN place/NN ./.
Luckily/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP free/JJ chips/NNS with/IN which/WDT to/TO try/VB the/DT many/JJ salsa/NN so/IN you/PRP can/MD pick/VB your/PRP$ favorite/JJ before/IN you/PRP food/NN arrives/NNS ./.
Food/NNP :/: So/IN fresh/JJ ,/, warm/NN ,/, and/CC just/RB plain/VB delicious/JJ ./.
We/PRP split/VBD the/DT Santo/NNP Plato/NNP and/CC Traditional/NNP Quesa/NNP ./.
The/DT Santo/NNP Plato/NNP comes/VBZ with/IN your/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN burro/NN and/CC taco/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN calabacitas/NNS ./.
We/PRP chose/VBP the/DT fish/JJ taco/NN which/WDT conveniently/RB came/VBD with/IN two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN fish/JJ and/CC two/CD tortillas/NNS so/IN it/PRP was/VBD like/IN having/JJ two/CD tacos/NNS !/.
It/PRP was/VBD traditional/JJ fried/VBN fish/JJ ``/`` Baja/NNP ''/'' style/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD light/JJ and/CC crispy/JJ instead/NN of/IN greasy/NN and/CC came/VBD with/IN a/DT savory/JJ white/JJ sauce/NN ./.
The/DT La/NNP Condesa/NNP Veggie/NNP burro/NN was/VBD filled/VBN white/JJ Mexican-style/NNP rice/NN (/NN but/CC not/RB that/IN orangish/JJ ``/`` Mexican/NNP rice/NN ''/'' you/PRP see/VBP at/IN fast/JJS food/NN joints/NNS )/RB ,/, Oaxaca/NNP cheese/NN ,/, mushrooms/NNS ,/, spinach/NN ,/, poblano/NN pepper/NN ,/, onions/NNS and/CC fresh/JJ garlic/NN ./.
The/DT burro/NN is/VBZ grilled/VBN after/IN its/PRP$ assembled/JJ which/WDT enhanced/VBD the/DT mouth/NN feel/NN ./.
Crispy/NNP outside/NNP ,/, soft/JJ inside/NN ./.
The/DT calabacitas/NNS were/VBD just/RB grilled/VBN green/JJ Mexican/NNP squash/NN ,/, nothing/NN special/NN ./.
The/DT Traditional/NNP Quesa/NNP was/VBD unlike/JJ anything/NN I/PRP 'd/MD ever/RB seen/VB ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP made/VBN with/IN a/DT THICK/NNP ,/, dense/VBP corn/NN tortilla/NN ,/, stuffed/VBD with/IN Oaxaca/NNP cheese/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB grilled/VBD for/IN a/DT nice/JJ crunch/NN ./.
These/DT bad/JJ boys/NNS are/VBP HUGE/NNP and/CC have/VBP so/RB much/RB cheese/VB which/WDT made/VBN me/PRP relieved/VBD to/TO be/VB sharing/VBG ./.
You/PRP have/VBP to/TO eat/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT fork/NN and/CC knife/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD amazing/VBG with/IN different/JJ salsa/NN varieties/NNS drizzled/VBD on/IN top/NNS ./.
Drinks/NNS :/: Try/NNP the/DT Horchata/NNP !/.
Best/NNP we/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
They/PRP put/VBD real/JJ fruit/NN and/CC pecans/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
There/EX was/VBD some/DT sort/NN of/IN strawberry/JJ syrup/NN in/IN the/DT bottom/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB overly/RB sweet/JJ ./.
The/DT serving/VBG size/NN is/VBZ 32oz/CD which/WDT was/VBD a/DT lot/NN bigger/NN than/IN we/PRP were/VBD expecting/VBG ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB any/DT alcohol/NN but/CC I/PRP overheard/VBP the/DT guy/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP tell/VBP the/DT waitress/NN his/PRP$ margarita/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
Atmosphere/RB :/: Be/NNP prepared/NNP because/IN this/DT place/NN it/PRP TINY/NNP !/.
We/PRP got/VBD there/RB at/IN the/DT right/JJ time/NN because/IN when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD leaving/VBN all/DT of/IN the/DT 10/CD or/CC so/RB tables/NNS were/VBD full/JJ ./.
People/NNS did/VBD n't/RB have/VB room/VBN to/TO wait/NN and/CC some/DT turned/JJ around/NNS and/CC left/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN they/PRP came/VBD in/IN and/CC saw/VBD how/WRB crowded/JJ it/PRP was/VBD ./.
There/EX is/VBZ an/DT itty/JJ bitty/NN bar/NN that/IN a/DT few/JJ people/NNS chose/VBP to/TO wait/NN at/IN ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ cute/JJ but/CC the/DT custom/NN made/VBD chairs/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ fragile/NN as/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO switch/NN mine/NN out/IN due/JJ to/TO the/DT bottom/NN falling/VBG out/NN ./.
Overall/NN :/: We/PRP know/VBP Mexican/JJ food/NN and/CC this/DT may/MD be/VB the/DT best/JJS we/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.

Dia/NNP del/NN morte/NN all/DT about/IN including/VBG cool/NN mosaic/NN tile/JJ art/NN ./.
We/PRP walked/VBD right/RB up/RB past/VB the/DT bar/NN to/TO look/VB up/RP menus/NN and/CC wait/NN on/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
No/DT tables/NNS available/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD directed/VBN to/TO use/VB the/DT men/NN 's/POS room/NN ./.
Which/NNP was/VBD decorated/VBN yet/RB cluttered/VBN with/IN a/DT music/JJ stand/NN ,/, stool/NN ,/, and/CC supplies/NNS ./.

The/DT horchata/NN contributed/VBD too/RB ./.
The/DT peanut/NN salsa/NN was/VBD the/DT hottest/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT salsa/NN de/IN albor/NN was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ experience/NN with/IN this/DT fruity/NN hot/NN Mexican/NNP Chile/NNP ./.
The/DT jicama/NN was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC refreshing/NN and/CC cooling/VBG but/CC very/RB hard/JJ to/TO get/VB on/IN the/DT chip/NN as/IN by/IN its/PRP$ nature/NN was/VBD n't/RB saucy/JJ ./.
However/RB the/DT cilantro/NN was/VBD too/RB soupy/JJ so/IN I/PRP could/MD only/RB pour/VB it/PRP on/IN ./.
The/DT pecan/NN was/VBD n't/RB spicy/JJ like/IN the/DT peanut/NN and/CC was/VBD therefore/JJ nice/NN against/IN the/DT heat/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT sign/NN for/IN another/DT business/NN there/VBZ that/IN says/VBZ FAT/NNP PAD/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ easily/RB visible/JJ ./.

I/PRP was/VBD skeptical/JJ at/IN first/RB because/IN the/DT parking/NN is/VBZ n't/RB very/RB inviting/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ somewhat/JJ small/JJ but/CC yet/RB quaint/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB excited/JJ to/TO try/NN all/PDT the/DT salsa/NN 's/POS but/CC was/VBD utterly/RB disappointed/JJ when/WRB the/DT chips/NNS they/PRP brought/VBP us/PRP were/VBD hard/RB ,/, stale/NN ,/, and/CC just/RB not/RB suitable/JJ for/IN eating/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP were/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT worst/NN chips/NNS I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD one../NN
I/PRP requested/VBD another/DT basket/NN and/CC they/PRP kindly/RB bought/VBD another/DT basket/NN of/IN chips/NNS but/CC they/PRP were/VBD the/DT same/JJ ,/, Stale/NNP ,/, hard/NNP and/CC dull/NNP ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Aztec/NNP Tinga/NNP Taco/NNP ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.

Overall/IN tacos/NNS were/VBD great/JJ for/IN the/DT money/NN ,/, just/RB disappointed/VBN with/IN the/DT chips/NNS ./.
We/PRP tried/VBD this/DT spot/NN last/JJ night/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.

The/DT lighting/NN is/VBZ horrible/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN layout/NN is/VBZ over/IN crowded/VBN and/CC the/DT lack/NN of/IN ambience/NN is/VBZ just/RB sad/JJ ./.
Now/RB with/IN all/DT of/IN that/DT said/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN was/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN fun/NN ./.
We/PRP enjoyed/VBD trying/VBG several/JJ types/NNS of/IN salsa/NN while/IN we/PRP waited/VBD for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT waiter/NN did/VBD not/RB put/VB our/PRP$ two/CD courses/NNS in/IN properly/RB ,/, so/RB after/IN waiting/VBG an/DT hour/NN ,/, everything/NN came/VBD at/IN once/RB ./.
This/DT was/VBD only/RB after/IN we/PRP asked/VBD about/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT waitress/NN apologized/VBD and/CC did/VBD comp/VB our/PRP$ beverages/NNS ./.
We/PRP are/VBP our/VBG entrees/NNS and/CC wrapped/VBD up/RP the/DT first/JJ course/NN to/TO eat/VB the/DT next/JJ day/NN ./.

Their/PRP$ quesas/NNS are/VBP the/DT bomb.com/NN !/.

The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC had/VBD different/JJ varieties/NNS of/IN salsas/NNS and/CC guacamole/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD there/RB around/IN 11:30/CD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB busy/JJ ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB surprising/JJ for/IN a/DT place/NN that/WDT has/VBZ really/RB good/JJ food/NN eh/NN ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB in/IN the/DT high-income/JJ part/NN of/IN Phoenix/NNP ,/, but/CC certainly/RB the/DT area/NN is/VBZ safe/JJ ./.

Over/IN hyped/VBD I/PRP think/VBP ./.
To/TO me/PRP the/DT tacos/NNS actually/RB lacked/VBD flavor/NN ./.
Had/NNP a/DT combo/NN of/IN 3/CD different/JJ types/NNS and/CC thought/VBD they/PRP were/VBD all/DT somewhat/JJ bland/NN and/CC lacked/VBD real/JJ creativity/NN ./.
Basically/RB its/PRP$ taco/NN truck/NN food/NN (/VBZ not/RB a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN )/NN at/IN probably/RB triple/VB the/DT price/NN (/VBD a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN )/NN ./.

Their/NNP margaritas/VBZ (/IN I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB had/VBD the/DT house/NN )/NNS are/VBP the/DT best/NN ,/, period/NN ./.

Salsa/NNP bar/NN is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP crave/VBP the/DT pecan/JJ salsa/NN !/.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB believe/VB I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB written/VBN a/DT review/NN for/IN La/NNP Condesa/NNP yet/NNP ./.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN disappointed/JJ here/RB ./.

Here/NNP is/VBZ the/DT deal/NN :/: -you/JJ start/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN chips/NNS ./.
And/CC then/RB you/PRP get/VB to/TO feast/NN on/IN the/DT humongous/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
My/NNP favorites/NNS are/VBP the/DT pecan/JJ (/NN creamy/NN ,/, thick/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN a/DT kick/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN )/NN ,/, cilantro/NN (/NN thinner/NN but/CC delicious/JJ )/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT tamarindo/NN (/NN sweet/NN and/CC spicy/NN )/NN ./.
Sadly/RB ,/, the/DT tamarindo/NN one/CD seems/NN to/TO be/VB quite/JJ elusive/JJ and/CC is/VBZ not/RB always/RB available/JJ ./.
You/PRP could/MD spend/VB hours/NNS trying/VBG all/PDT the/DT different/JJ salsas/NNS ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP though/IN with/IN Iain/NN ,/, the/DT peanut/NN was/VBD the/DT weak/JJ link/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP only/RB had/VBD the/DT tacos/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP imagine/VBP everything/NN to/TO be/VB of/IN the/DT same/JJ quality/NN ./.
So/IN these/DT tacos/NNS come/VBP with/IN double/JJ tortillas/NNS to/TO hold/VB all/PDT the/DT ingredients/NNS ./.
These/NNS are/VBP n't/RB skimpy/NN by/IN any/DT means/NN ./.
Two/NNS should/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ for/IN most/JJS people/NNS ./.
The/DT Cabo/NNP Shrimp/NNP is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
Huge/NNP shrimp/VBD beer/NN battered/VBD with/IN a/DT creamy/NN sauce/NN on/IN top/JJ ./.
The/DT chicken/NN mole/NN taco/NN was/VBD also/RB great/JJ with/IN that/DT special/JJ chocolately/NN flavor/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.

Though/NNP in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN after/IN four/CD or/CC so/RB visits/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ best/VBN to/TO come/VB enjoy/VB the/DT chips/NNS and/CC salsa/NN and/CC then/RB indulge/VB in/IN two/CD tacos/NNS ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ really/RB hard/JJ to/TO find/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP find/VBP Palm/NNP and/CC McDowell/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ right/RB there/RB with/IN a/DT few/JJ parking/NN spots/NNS along/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP like/IN tacos/NNS ,/, you/PRP need/VBP to/TO come/VB here/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB that/IN simple/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP found/VBD this/DT place/NN when/WRB our/JJ friends/NNS moved/VBD to/TO the/DT area/NN ./.

All/DT of/IN their/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ but/CC the/DT mole/NN .../:

I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN their/PRP$ black/JJ mole/NN tacos/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ black/NN mole/NN sandwich/NN and/CC the/DT heavenly/JJ Oaxacan/NNP Black/NNP Mole/NNP Chicken/NNP Quesa/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ more/RBR like/IN an/DT empanada/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP from/IN the/DT Midwest/NN originally/RB ./.

This/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ probably/RB my/JJ single/JJ favorite/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/VB since/IN moving/VBG here/RB 3/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.

The/DT mole/NN was/VBD to/TO die/VB for/IN and/CC the/DT shark/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
The/DT rice/NN is/VBZ also/RB so/RB tasty/JJ and/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB usually/RB a/DT rice/NN kind/NN of/IN guy/NN ./.
I/PRP always/VBP forgo/RB ordering/VBG the/DT traditional/JJ side/NN of/IN rice/NNP &/CC beans/NNP and/CC initially/NNP I/PRP did/VBD the/DT same/NN on/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN ./.

The/DT rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS were/VBD the/DT best/NN ,/, THE/NNP BEST/NNP ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Also/RB ,/, One/CD outstanding/JJ veggie/NN quesadilla/NN ./.
What/WP !/JJ !/NN !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB even/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN Mexican/NNP food/NN but/CC this/DT was/VBD pretty/RB damn/JJ good/JJ !/NN
So/RB many/JJ colorful/JJ unique/JJ flavorful/JJ sauces/NNS and/CC salsas/VBZ helped/VBD a/DT lot/NN ./.
Really/RB really/RB delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT chips/NNS were/VBD good/JJ too/NN ,/, not/RB greasy/JJ at/IN all/DT Hot/NNP hats/NNS drink/VBP had/VBD nuts/NNS and/CC fruits/NNS in/IN it/PRP which/WDT I/PRP ate/VBP with/IN a/DT fork/NN afterwards/VBZ .../: Service/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
There/NNS were/VBD two/CD servers/NNS and/CC they/PRP handled/VBD it/PRP well/RB ./.
Alan/NNP took/VBD care/NN of/IN us/PRP and/CC he/PRP was/VBD friendly/RB professional/JJ and/CC nice/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ ./.
When/WRB we/PRP came/VBD in/IN ,/, the/DT place/NN had/VBD three/CD tables/NNS ./.

We/PRP parked/VBD around/IN the/DT corner/NN in/IN the/DT white/JJ spaces/NNS ./.
The/DT place/NN has/VBZ a/DT cool/NN exterior/NN and/CC a/DT cool/NN interior/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP add/VBG a/DT photo/NN of/IN two/CD Enjoy/NNP ,/, folks/NNS ,/, this/DT one/NN is/VBZ a/DT winner/NN .../:
This/DT is/VBZ my/RB first/JJ time/NN in/IN Phoenix/NNP and/CC decided/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN this/DT evening/NN due/JJ to/TO all/DT the/DT yelper/JJ reviews/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
The/DT salsa/NN Bar/NNP had/VBD many/JJ different/JJ flavors/NNS of/IN salsas/NNS --/: yum/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.
I/PRP was/VBD really/RB pleased/VBN ./.
So/RB many/JJ varieties/NNS and/CC all/DT complimented/VBN our/PRP$ meals/NNS very/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT al/JJ pastor/NN bowl/NN (/VBD perfect/RB low/JJ carb/NN option/NN )/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT kids/NN had/VBD a/DT chicken/VBN quesadilla/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD very/RB happy/JJ ./.
If/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP ever/RB up/RB this/DT way/NN I/PRP just/RB may/MD come/VB here/RB again/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT wait/NN for/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB a/DT table/JJ and/CC we/PRP also/RB had/VBD to/TO wait/VB 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN the/DT food/NN to/TO come/VB ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ fine/VBN except/IN for/IN little/JJ kids/NNS having/VBG to/TO wait/NN was/VBD not/RB easy/JJ ./.
Amazing/VBG fair/NN with/IN a/DT laid/JJ back/NN atmosphere/RB ./.
Love/NNP the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN !/.
Love/NNP how/WRB their/PRP$ menu/NN basically/RB blasts/VBZ TexMex/NNP as/IN giving/NNP Mexican/NNP food/VBD a/DT bad/JJ representation/NN ./.
Now/RB this/DT is/VBZ authentic/JJ Mexican/JJ food/NN ./.
Not/RB some/DT heavy/JJ just/RB because/IN we/PRP 're/VBP Americans/VBN portion/NN ./.
Ordered/IN a/DT lonches/NNS ./.
Because/IN they/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO be/VB different/JJ from/IN a/DT torta/NN ./.
But/CC even/RB in/IN the/DT mindset/NN of/IN what/WP a/DT standard/JJ torta/NN is/VBZ ,/, these/DT lonches/NNS are/VBP WAY/NNP BETTER/NNP ./.
Bread/JJ sustains/NNS itself/VBP to/TO the/DT fillings/NNS (/VBP instead/RB of/IN falling/NN apart/NN or/CC soaking/VBG up/RP stuff/NN like/IN a/DT torta/NN bread/JJ does/NN ./.
Ordered/NNP shark/NN ./.
So/IN that/DT was/VBD different/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT freshness/NN to/TO it/PRP due/JJ to/TO a/DT cucumber/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT nice/JJ crispness/NN to/TO each/DT bite/NN ./.
Brother/RB ordered/VBD the/DT al/JJ pastor/NN lonche/NN and/CC he/PRP thoroughly/RB enjoyed/VBD it/PRP as/RB well/RB ./.
Girlfriend/NNP ordered/VBD the/DT mole/NN quesadilla/NN ./.
And/CC yes/VBZ yes/NNS yes/NNS !/.
Delivered/NNP on/IN the/DT multiple/JJ layers/NNS of/IN spices/NNS within/IN the/DT mole/NN ./.
Man/NNP ,/, have/VBP I/PRP always/RB only/RB had/VBD flat/VBN moles/NNS (/VBP such/JJ a/DT sad/JJ fact/NN )/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD imagine/VB not/RB being/VBG able/JJ to/TO order/NN mole/NN from/IN anywhere/RB else/RB ever/RB again/RB !/.
Eeeek/NNP !/.
But/CC do/VBP give/VBP it/PRP a/DT try/NN ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC this/DT quesadilla/NN looked/VBD more/RBR like/IN a/DT dessert/NN ./.
But/CC nope/NN ./.
A/DT nice/JJ balance/NN between/IN the/DT spices/NNS of/IN the/DT mole/NN ,/, meat/NN (/NN chicken/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC cotija/NN cheese/NN that/WDT 's/POS sprinkled/VBD over/IN it/PRP ./.
Also/RB tried/VBD their/PRP$ horchata/NN ./.
Once/NNP again/RB ,/, flavors/NNS up/IN the/DT Ying-yang/NNP !/.
Theirs/NNP nuts/NNS ,/, melons/NNS ,/, freshly/RB mashed/VBD strawberries/NNS ./.
So/RB definitely/RB not/RB your/VB typical/JJ Americanized/VBN Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN ./.
Tip/NN :/: do/VBP n't/RB park/VB in/IN the/DT front/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ extremely/RB difficult/JJ to/TO back/VB out/RP into/IN the/DT busy/NN traffic/NN street/NN ./.
Especially/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP alone/RB ./.
Somewhat/NNP more/RBR doable/JJ if/IN you/PRP have/VBP someone/VBN standing/VBG outside/IN the/DT car/NN giving/VBG your/NN a/DT thumbs/RB up/RB ./.
Remember/NN :/: food/NN adventures/NNS are/VBP out/IN there/RB ./.
So/RB eat/JJ 'em/NN up/IN !/CD
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ probably/RB paradise/NN for/IN my/PRP$ white/non-hispanic/JJ friends/NNS !/.
I/PRP was/VBD born/JJ and/CC raised/VBD in/IN Mexico/NNP ,/, so/RB I/PRP know/VBP La/JJ Santisima/NNP is/VBZ NOT/NNP authentic/JJ mexican/JJ food/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ tasty/JJ food/NN and/CC for/IN a/DT good/JJ price/NN ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN with/IN about/IN 23,594/CD different/JJ salsas/NNS (/VBP ok/NN ,/, maybe/NN I/PRP exaggerated/VBD a/DT bit/NN )/NN but/CC only/RB about/RB 2/CD are/VBP pretty/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP say/VBP this/DT restaurant/NN consists/VBZ more/JJR of/IN ``/`` Mexican-American/JJ ''/'' food/NN ./.
But/CC if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP hispanic/JJ and/CC want/JJ to/TO take/VB your/RP non-hispanic/JJ buddies/NNS to/TO a/DT ``/`` mexican/JJ ''/'' place/NN ,/, then/RB La/JJ Santisima/NNP is/VBZ the/DT perfect/NN spot/NN where/WRB their/PRP$ minds/NNS will/MD be/VB blown/VBN thinking/-NONE- they/PRP 're/VBP eating/VBG ``/`` authentic/JJ ''/'' mexican/JJ food/NN and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB satisfied/VBN too/RB with/IN the/DT tasty/NN Americanized/VBD version/NN of/IN a/DT torta/NN or/CC quesadilla/NN ./.
But/CC shhhhh/JJ .../: you/PRP know/VB the/DT secret/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB !/VB
Not/RB impressed/VBN ,/, after/IN reading/NN the/DT comment/NN i/NN though/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT great/JJ spot/NN ,/, but/CC wish/JJ i/NN didnt/NN go/IN there/RB honestly/RB
Maintain/NNP low/JJ expectations/NN for/IN service/NN ,/, wait/NN times/NNS ,/, and/CC general/JJ common/JJ sense/NN ./.
But/CC damn/NN is/VBZ the/DT food/NN ever/RB worth/JJ such/JJ trauma/NN ./.
Absolutely/RB delicious/JJ and/CC unique/JJ tacos/NNS ./.
I/PRP would/MD highly/RB recommend/VB this/DT place/NN ./.
Great/NNP salsa/NNP bar/NN ,/, secluded/VBD atmosphere/RB ./.
I/PRP take/VBP friends/NNS here/RB from/IN out/IN of/IN town/NN to/TO give/VB them/PRP a/DT real/JJ taste/NN of/IN Mexican/NNP food/NN !/.
Walked/NNP into/IN a/DT small/JJ crammed/JJ room/NN with/IN dingy/JJ white/JJ walls/NNS and/CC Day/NN of/IN the/DT Dead/NNP themed/VBD wall/JJ decor/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB in/RP disarray/NN as/IN a/DT regular/JJ ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD basically/RB $/$ 10/CD and/CC up/RB ./.
Quesadilla/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, was/VBD like/IN a/DT mexican/JJ calzone/NN type/NN thing/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, not/RB worth/RB going/VBG there/RB ./.
Guy/NNP Fieri/NNP did/VBD them/PRP a/DT solid/JJ giving/VBG them/PRP more/JJR credit/NN than/IN they/PRP deserved/VBD ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD tasty/JJ ,/, but/CC perhaps/RB the/DT customer/NN service/NN ,/, seating/NN and/CC cleanliness/NN can/MD be/VB better/RBR ?/.
Wow/NNP !/.
We/PRP pulled/VBD up/RP to/TO this/DT place/NN with/IN some/DT skepticism/NN ,/, but/CC after/IN entering/VBG we/PRP immediately/RB knew/VBD we/PRP were/VBD in/IN for/IN a/DT great/JJ lunch/NN ./.
With/IN a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN in/IN the/DT corner/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD given/VBN chips/NNS and/CC first/JJ tried/NN 3/NN different/JJ salsas/NNS ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD types/NNS of/IN tacos/NNS and/CC a/DT chicken/NN mole/NN quesadilla/NN to/TO share/NN ./.
The/DT tacos/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT quesadilla/NN was/VBD like/IN a/DT fluffy/JJ fried/JJ calzone/NN ./.
Absolutely/RB delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT only/JJ bump/NN was/VBD the/DT fact/NN I/PRP ordered/VBP my/JJ taco/NN with/IN no/DT mushrooms/NNS and/CC it/PRP came/VBD with/IN them/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB mind/VB that/DT much/JJ ./.
My/NNP husband/NN had/VBD a/DT hornitos/NN margarita/NN which/WDT was/VBD good/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.
Next/NNP time/NN we/PRP 're/VBP in/IN Phoenix/NNP we/PRP will/MD certainly/RB be/VB back/RB !/.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT question/NN this/DT place/NN has/VBZ the/DT BEST/NNP Mexican/NNP food/NN in/IN the/DT valley/NN ./.
My/NNP problem/NN is/VBZ with/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP is/VBZ ran/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT patron/NN here/RB since/IN before/IN it/PRP was/VBD on/IN tv/NN ,/, before/IN anybody/NN heard/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, before/IN it/PRP was/VBD popular/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP raved/VBN on/IN yelp/JJ how/NN delicious/VBZ the/DT breakfast/NN is/VBZ here/RB ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB served/VBN on/IN weekends/NNS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
The/DT past/JJ three/CD times/NNS I/PRP have/VBP come/VBN for/IN the/DT desayundos/NNS ,/, the/DT waiters/NNS told/VBD me/PRP that/IN I/PRP missed/VBD brunch/JJ hours/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD get/VB there/RB pretty/RB late/JJ ,/, around/IN 230/CD so/IN I/PRP understood/VBD ./.
She/PRP said/VBD 2/CD was/VBD The/DT cut/NN off/NN ./.
The/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP got/VBD there/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD 1/CD ,/, and/CC ironically/RB ,/, they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB serving/JJ breakfast/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD just/RB missed/VBN it/PRP ./.
Now/RB this/DT time/NN ,/, I/PRP came/VBD at/IN noon/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT more/JJR breakfast/NN ./.
What/WP a/DT Shame/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN my/VBN favorite/JJ breakfast/NN in/IN almost/RB a/DT year/NN ./.
And/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ every/DT time/NN I/PRP get/VBP ther/RB ,/, is/VBZ when/WRB they/PRP stop/VBP serving/VBG it/PRP ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT salsa/NN is/VBZ picked/VBN over/IN before/IN noon/NN ./.
They/PRP make/VBP a/DT wonderful/JJ salsa/NN seven/NN chiles/NNS that/IN I/PRP could/MD eat/VB as/IN a/DT main/JJ course/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ always/RB out/IN when/WRB I/PRP get/VBP there/RB ./.
Ever/NN since/IN it/PRP has/VBZ become/VBN popular/JJ it/PRP seems/VBZ the/DT customer/NN service/NN is/VBZ poor/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT rules/NNS keep/VBP changing/VBG ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ wonderful/JJ ,/, everything/NN else/NN is/VBZ horrible/JJ ./.
There/EX really/RB are/VBP few/JJ words/NNS to/TO describe/VB how/WRB perfect/JJ the/DT food/NN is/VBZ ,/, how/WRB delectable/JJ the/DT salas/NNS are/VBP ,/, how/WRB great/JJ the/DT waitstaff/NN is/VBZ ,/, and/CC how/WRB awesome/JJ the/DT vibe/NN is/VBZ ./.
Sufficeth/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, we/PRP come/VBP here/RB at/IN least/JJS twice/NN a/DT month/NN (/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO hold/VB ourselves/NNS back/RB !/VBP )/NN ./.
Since/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN 's/POS from/IN SoCal/NNP and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT born/NN and/CC bred/VBD Austinite/NNP ,/, we/PRP both/DT grew/NN up/IN eating/VBG delicious/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN La/NNP Condesa/NNP truly/RB beats/VBZ out/RP even/RB my/JJ favorite/JJ spots/NNS in/IN San/NNP Diego/NNP or/CC Austin/NNP (/NNP sorry/NN ,/, hometown/NN !/.
you/PRP still/RB have/VBP the/DT best/JJS migas/NN !/NN )/NN ./.

My/NNP absolutely/RB favorite/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/VB tacos/NNS in/IN Phoenix/NNP .../: wait/NN ,/, make/VBP that/DT Arizona/NNP !/.
So/RB happy/JJ they/PRP got/VBD the/DT expansion/NN done/NN because/IN more/JJR people/NNS should/MD visit/VB this/DT little/JJ gem/NN when/WRB visiting/VBG ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB let/VB the/DT neighborhood/NN discourage/NN you/PRP from/IN coming/VBG -/JJ the/DT tacos/NNS are/VBP worth/VBG the/DT drive/JJ !/NN
Get/NNP the/DT al/JJ pastor/NN and/CC tinga/NN .../NNS do/VBP n't/RB forget/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT margarita/NN too/RB as/IN they/PRP are/VBP oh/JJ so/RB good/JJ !/NN !/.

Whenever/NNP we/PRP travel/VBP anywhere/RB I/PRP use/VBP the/DT ``/`` TV/NN Foods/NNS ''/'' app/NN and/CC then/RB cross/VBZ check/NN places/NNS on/IN Yelp/NNP to/TO find/VB great/JJ places/NNS to/TO eat/VB ./.
Well/NNP ,/, this/DT place/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT small/JJ neighborhood/NN like/IN place/NN with/IN great/JJ food/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN with/IN about/IN 20/CD kinds/NNS to/TO try/NNS ./.
My/NNP favorites/NNS were/VBD the/DT mango/strawberry/JJ one/CD and/CC a/DT orange/NN colored/VBN pecan/JJ one/CD (/NN had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ kick/NN )/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP both/VBP got/VBN gourmet/JJ tacos/NNS ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB remember/VB what/WP all/DT ones/NNS I/PRP had/VBD but/CC all/DT were/VBD great/JJ ./.
Favorite/NNP was/VBD the/DT battered/VBN shrimp/NN one/CD (/NN top/JJ left/NN option/NN on/IN that/DT page/NN of/IN menu/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT Horchata/NNP was/VBD the/DT best/JJS one/CD I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD (/VBN so/RB said/VBD many/JJ others/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ reviews/NNS )/VBP ./.
Had/NNP real/NNP fruit/NN and/CC pecans/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
Must/RB go/VBD to/TO this/DT place/NN !/VBD !/RB !/JJ !/.
We/PRP will/MD go/VB again/RB ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ small/JJ but/CC totally/RB worth/IN it/PRP ./.
Guac/NNP has/VBZ mangos/NNS in/IN it/PRP which/WDT just/RB makes/VBZ its/PRP$ all/PDT the/DT more/RBR amazing/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC the/DT margartia/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS one/CD that/IN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.
The/DT service/NN however/RB was/VBD poor/JJ ./.
It/PRP took/VBD way/NN to/TO long/JJ to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN by/IN the/DT waitstaff/NN ./.
I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP was/VBD because/IN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB enough/JJ employees/NNS ./.
We/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB !/.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ fun/JJ and/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT great/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ so/RB small/JJ and/CC always/RB packed/VBD ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN we/PRP tried/VBD to/TO go/VB they/PRP only/RB accepted/JJ cash/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN it/PRP was/VBD so/RB packed/VBN that/IN we/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB get/VB out/IN of/IN our/PRP$ seats/NNS to/TO check/NN out/IN the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD delicious/JJ but/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD uncomfortable/JJ and/CC too/RB overcrowded/VBN to/TO enjoy/VB ./.
Man/NNP ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB given/VBN such/JJ a/DT low/JJ review/NN .../: where/WRB do/VBP I/PRP start/VBP ?/.
So/IN I/PRP get/VBP an/DT hour/NN long/RB lunch/JJ everyday/NN ./.
I/PRP work/VBP extremely/RB close/JJ to/TO La/NNP Santisma/NNP ,/, so/RB I/PRP figured/VBD that/IN this/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO check/NN out/IN and/CC that/IN I/PRP 'd/MD have/VB plenty/NN of/IN time/NN to/TO sit/VB down/RP and/CC enjoy/JJ my/NN food/NN ./.
Wrong/NNP ./.
I/PRP showed/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT coworker/NN around/IN 2:30pm/CD ./.
There/EX were/VBD maybe/NN 18/CD other/JJ customers/NNS MAX/RB in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD about/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS for/IN us/PRP to/TO get/VB cups/NNS of/IN water/NN and/CC it/PRP took/VBD 30-35/CD minutes/NNS for/IN someone/NN to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ order/NN ./.
And/CC had/VBD I/PRP not/RB approached/VBD a/DT waitress/NN requesting/VBG to/TO have/VB our/VBN orders/NNS taken/RB ,/, it/PRP probably/RB would/MD 've/VB taken/RB longer/RBR ./.
There/EX were/VBD plenty/NN of/IN waiters/NNS and/CC waitresses/NNS standing/VBG around/IN ,/, chatting/VBG ./.
Customers/NNS that/IN came/NN in/IN after/IN us/PRP were/VBD served/VBN before/IN us/PRP ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ huge/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ SO/RB much/JJ to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ plus/NN !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ overwhelming/NN but/CC I/PRP LOVE/NNP variety/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB decide/VB so/RB I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT waitress/NN to/TO tell/NN me/PRP what/WP the/DT spiciest/JJS burrito/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN was/VBD ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP requesting/VBG the/DT Mayan/NNP burro/NN ./.
While/IN we/PRP were/VBD waiting/VBG for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN to/TO arrive/VB ,/, we/PRP checked/VBD out/RP the/DT awesome/NN salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
I/PRP LOVE/NNP salsa/NN and/CC tried/VBD every/DT single/JJ one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ options/NNS ./.
My/NNP favorite/NN was/VBD definitely/RB the/DT cilantro/NN one/CD as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT green/JJ chile/NN one/CD ./.
We/PRP visited/VBD the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN 3-4/CD times/NNS (/JJ seriously/RB ,/, we/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP )/-NONE- ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ food/NN still/RB had/VBD n't/RB arrived/VBN ./.
Upon/IN its/PRP$ arrival/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB an/DT extra/JJ couple/NN of/IN minutes/NNS for/IN utensils/NNS and/CC napkins/NNS ./.
By/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP had/VBD everything/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD maybe/VBN 10/CD minutes/NNS left/VBD to/TO eat/VB our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP eating/VBG a/DT fourth/NN of/IN my/PRP$ burrito/NN and/CC took/VBD the/DT rest/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD late/JJ for/IN work/NN ./.
The/DT burrito/NN itself/NN was/VBD not/RB spicy/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ !/NN
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ portion/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD $/$ 9.99/CD ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ .../: after/IN I/PRP drowned/VBD it/PRP in/IN salsa/NN ./.
Honestly/RB ,/, I/PRP probably/RB would/MD n't/RB get/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
And/CC I/PRP know/VBP this/DT place/NN is/VBZ known/RB for/IN their/PRP$ tacos/NNS and/CC not/RB their/PRP$ burritos/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB sure/JJ to/TO check/NN them/PRP out/IN if/IN I/PRP ever/VBP come/VBN here/RB again/RB ./.
And/CC to/TO be/VB quite/JJ blunt/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN I/PRP ever/VBP will/MD ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/VB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ worth/IN the/DT wait/NN and/CC the/DT horrible/JJ service/NN .../: As/RB much/RB as/IN I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN and/CC the/DT ambiance/NN ,/, I/PRP definitely/RB feel/VBP like/IN there/EX 's/VBZ some/DT other/JJ place/NN out/IN there/EX that/IN has/VBZ better/VBN service/NN and/CC better/JJR salsa/NN ./.
Until/IN the/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP decide/VBP to/TO visit/NN this/DT location/NN and/CC update/JJ my/NN review/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN gets/VBZ two/CD stars/NNS for/IN me/PRP ./.

I/PRP truly/VBP do/RB hope/VBG some/DT of/IN these/DT concerns/NNS are/VBP addressed/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP would/MD have/VB loved/VBN many/JJ of/IN the/DT salsas/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP ran/VBD out/IN of/IN cups/NNS &/CC had/VBD small/JJ plates/NNS to/TO put/VB the/DT salsas/NNS on/IN instead/RB ./.
Dude/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB hard/JJ to/TO dunk/VB a/DT tortilla/NN chip/NN into/IN a/DT plate/NN of/IN salsa/NN ./.

The/DT Mayan/NNP pork/NN taco/NN was/VBD damn/JJ near/IN perfect/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT chicken/NN mole/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/RB much/RB on/IN the/DT sweet/JJ side/NN ./.
Best/NNP Mexican/NNP food/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN years/NNS .../: and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBD a/DT lot/NN ./.

That/DT said/VBD ,/, the/DT food/NN did/VBD not/RB blow/JJ my/NN mind/NN ./.

We/PRP drove/VBP from/IN Mesa/NNP &/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB take/VB too/RB long/RB on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP afternoon/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB excited/VBN about/IN a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN since/IN I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB been/VBN to/TO one/CD and/CC my/CD last/JJ meal/NN would/MD definitely/RB include/VB chips/NNS and/CC salsa/NN ./.
The/DT rave/JJ reviews/NNS on/IN Yelp/NNP won/NNP me/NN over/IN so/RB I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO recommend/VB this/DT place/NN to/TO a/DT friend/NN so/IN we/PRP could/MD meet/VB up/RP for/IN lunch/NN ./.
Luckily/RB I/PRP snagged/VBD a/DT spot/NN right/NN out/IN front/NN at/IN 1pm/CD but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ where/WRB the/DT additional/JJ parking/NN was/VBD ?/.
Upon/NNP entering/NN ,/, the/DT place/NN has/VBZ some/DT cute/JJ decor/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ startling/NN to/TO walk/NN in/IN and/CC see/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB small/JJ inside/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD busy/NN ./.
With/IN no/DT hostest/NN stand/NN ,/, I/PRP immediately/RB had/VBD that/IN ,/, 'deer/NN in/IN headlights/NNS look/NNS '/POS about/IN what/WP to/TO do/VB and/CC where/VB to/TO go/VB but/CC I/PRP was/VBD recognized/VBN when/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN within/IN a/DT few/JJ seconds/NNS and/CC luckily/RB there/EX was/VBD a/DT table/JJ for/IN two/CD open/JJ ./.
While/IN I/PRP was/VBD recognized/VBN and/CC that/DT was/VBD a/DT relief/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB greeted/VBN per/NNS say/VBP but/CC was/VBD just/RB asked/RB if/IN there/EX would/MD only/RB be/VB one/CD for/IN lunch/NN ./.
I/PRP said/VBD I/PRP was/VBD waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT friend/NN so/RB luckily/RB they/PRP sat/VBP me/PRP without/IN her/PRP being/VBG there/RB ./.
The/DT water/NN came/VBD around/IN and/CC gave/VBD me/PRP small/JJ plastic/JJ Solo/NNP cup/NN full/NN for/IN water/NN and/CC menus/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB seen/VBN solo/NN cups/NNS like/IN this/DT in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ?/.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ for/IN the/DT lunch/NN crowd/NN ?/.
I/PRP noticed/VBD all/PDT the/DT other/JJ tables/NNS had/VBD larger/VBN drinks/NNS ,/, also/RB in/IN plastic/JJ cups/NNS ,/, so/RB maybe/VB it/PRP was/VBD just/RB for/IN your/PRP$ drinks/NNS to/TO go/VB ?/.
Anyway/NNP ,/, my/NNP friend/NN arrived/VBD a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS later/JJ and/CC after/IN we/PRP got/VBD caught/VBN up/RP on/IN our/PRP$ week/NN and/CC looked/VBD over/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO flag/NN down/IN our/PRP$ waiter/NN to/TO order/NN ./.
I/PRP attempted/VBD to/TO order/VB the/DT grapefruit/NN margarita/NN that/IN I/PRP had/VBD heard/VBN rave/JJ reviews/NNS about/IN but/CC the/DT waiter/NN did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB 'Grapefruit/JJ Margarita/NNP '/POS and/CC offered/VBD some/DT fruity/NN one/CD with/IN melon/NN and/CC something/NN else/RB ./.
When/WRB I/PRP confirmed/VBP that/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB grapefruit/NN and/CC he/PRP offered/VBD another/DT one/CD ,/, again/RB without/IN grapefruit/NN ,/, I/PRP opted/VBD just/RB to/TO forget/VB it/PRP and/CC drink/VB the/DT water/NN ./.
I/PRP figured/VBD I/PRP would/MD fill/VB up/RP on/IN chips/NNS and/CC salsa/NN so/IN I/PRP went/VBD with/IN two/CD al/JJ la/NN cart/NN tacos/NNS ./.
My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD a/DT mahi/NN mahi/NN bowl/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB impressed/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ chips/NNS ,/, not/RB overly/RB thick/JJ like/IN some/DT places/NNS and/CC pretty/RB light/JJ and/CC the/DT the/DT 6-7/CD salsas/NNS we/PRP tried/VBP were/VBD mostly/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB aware/JJ there/NN was/VBD a/DT need/NN for/IN peanut/NN salsa/NN ?/.
It/PRP was/VBD definitely/RB different/JJ but/CC not/RB something/NN I/PRP needed/VBD to/TO try/NNP twice/NN ./.
My/NNP favorites/NNS were/VBD the/DT creamy/NN white/JJ one/CD (/NN ca/MD n't/RB remember/VB the/DT name/NN )/NN and/CC the/DT strawberry/NN salsa/NN one/CD ./.
You/PRP go/VBP help/RB yourself/JJ to/TO the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN once/RB they/PRP bring/VBP the/DT chips/NNS but/CC it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN you/PRP had/VBD to/TO pay/VB extra/NN for/IN an/DT extra/JJ bowl/NN of/IN chips/NNS since/IN they/PRP were/VBD on/IN their/PRP$ special/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN board/NN for/IN $/$ 2/CD ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT salsa/NN bar/NN had/VBD small/JJ dipping/JJ cups/NNS to/TO eat/VB the/DT salsa/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP about/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT to-go/NN dressing/VBG cups/NNS you/PRP get/VB in/IN other/JJ restaurants/NNS but/CC not/RB quite/RB as/RB deep/VB ./.
Again/NNP ,/, they/PRP were/VBD plastic/JJ so/IN it/PRP kinda/NN took/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT overall/JJ feel/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP all/DT for/IN convenience/NN and/CC I/PRP know/VBP this/DT probably/NN cuts/VBZ down/RP on/IN the/DT customers/NNS filling/VBG up/RP larger/JJR containers/NNS and/CC wasting/VBG salsa/NN .../: and/CC doing/VBG dishes/NNS .../: but/CC I/PRP would/MD think/VB there/RB has/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT more/JJR environmentally/NN and/CC more/JJR aesthetic/JJ way/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT ?/.
Granted/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ no/DT fancy/NN Mexican/NNP place/NN but/CC they/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO put/VB effort/NN in/IN the/DT decor/NN so/RB maybe/VBD that/IN 's/POS where/WRB they/PRP spent/VBP all/DT their/PRP$ money/NN on/IN rather/RB than/IN real/JJ dishes/NNS ?/.
It/PRP definitely/RB did/VBD discourage/NN me/NN from/IN going/VBG back/NNS for/IN seconds/NNS though/IN so/RB maybe/NN that/IN was/VBD their/PRP$ goal/NN ?/.
Our/NNP food/NN came/VBD and/CC both/DT my/NNS tacos/NNS were/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT presentation/NN was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, no/DT plastic/JJ there/NN !/.
The/DT tortillas/NNS were/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC all/DT ingredients/NNS seemed/VBD quality/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN said/VBD her/PRP dish/VB was/VBD really/RB good/JJ and/CC she/PRP got/VBD a/DT really/RB big/JJ portion/NN ./.
We/PRP enjoyed/VBD our/PRP$ meal/NN but/CC our/PRP$ waiter/NN never/RB returned/VBD ./.
A/DT young/JJ kid/NN ,/, maybe/NN 8/NN or/CC 10/NN ,/, came/VBD over/IN and/CC asked/VBD to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ plates/NNS and/CC he/PRP asked/VBD if/IN there/EX was/VBD anything/NN else/RB we/PRP needed/VBP ./.
I/PRP requested/VBD the/DT bill/NN thinking/VBG he/PRP would/MD tell/VB our/PRP$ waiter/NN that/IN we/PRP were/VBD ready/NN for/IN the/DT check/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP guessing/JJ this/DT is/VBZ a/DT family/NN owned/NN place/NN so/IN I/PRP understand/VBP everyone/NN pitching/NN in/IN but/CC the/DT kid/NN then/RB delivered/VBD our/PRP$ check/NN and/CC then/RB took/VBD our/PRP$ credit/NN cards/NNS to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT bill/NN !/.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD standing/VBG back/RB at/IN the/DT register/NN ,/, almost/RB watching/VBG over/IN him/PRP though/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP still/RB was/VBD n't/RB overly/RB eager/VB about/IN handing/NN over/IN my/JJ card/NN to/TO such/VB a/DT young/JJ kid/NN ./.
He/PRP was/VBD at/IN least/JJS faster/JJR than/IN our/PRP$ waiter/NN though/IN so/RB I/PRP guess/VBP it/PRP was/VBD okay/NN ./.
I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB to/TO harp/VB on/IN this/DT place/NN because/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Just/IN a/DT few/JJ more/RBR things/NNS done/JJ differently/RB and/CC I/PRP could/MD see/VB this/DT being/VBG a/DT go-to/NN spot/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
For/IN now/RB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB top/VB my/PRP$ list/NN of/IN places/NNS I/PRP have/VBP to/TO come/VB back/RB to/TO soon/RB ./.
As/IN the/DT name/NN implies/VBZ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT eatery/NN that/IN specialized/VBN in/IN tacos/NNS and/CC wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN salsas/NNS ./.
Among/IN 5/NN of/IN us/PRP ,/, three/CD ordered/NNS tacos/NNS and/CC were/VBD pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, and/CC two/CD persons/NNS ordered/IN the/DT Quesa/NN :/: La/NNP Condesa/NNP Mahi/NNP Mahi/NNP and/CC Sonora/NNP Arrachera/NNP Quesa/NNP ./.
The/DT quesa/NN is/VBZ like/IN a/DT jumbo/NN empanada/NN made/VBD with/IN corn/NN flour/NN dough/JJ then/RB deep/VB fried/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP it/PRP at/IN the/DT waitress/NN recommendation/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ the/DT soft/NN corn/NN flour/JJ dough/JJ makes/NN it/PRP very/RB hard/JJ to/TO stay/NN together/NN during/IN the/DT frying/NN process/NN however/RB the/DT creation/NN is/VBZ way/NN too/RB doughy/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ ,/, with/IN little/JJ filling/NN ./.
Nobody/NN ordered/VBD burritos/NNS ./.
If/IN we/PRP come/VBP back/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD definitely/RB recommend/VB my/PRP$ friends/family/NN to/TO stay/VB with/IN the/DT tacos/NNS ./.
So/RB bummed/VBD ./.
We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN going/VBG to/TO this/DT place/NN for/IN years/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP gave/VBP it/PRP 2/-NONE- stars/VBZ over/IN 1/CD ./.
In/IN the/DT food/NN biz/NN service/NN is/VBZ everything/NN and/CC this/DT place/NN has/VBZ broken/VBN my/PRP$ heart/NN ./.
We/PRP brought/VBD a/DT friend/NN here/RB from/IN NY/NNP ranting/NN and/CC raving/VBG about/IN the/DT food/NN the/DT whole/JJ way/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD we/PRP were/VBD quickly/RB embarrassed/VBN as/IN the/DT entire/JJ staff/NN treated/VBD us/PRP as/IN if/IN we/PRP were/VBD invisible/JJ ./.
We/PRP stood/VBD by/IN the/DT ``/`` please/NN wait/NN to/TO be/VB seated/VBN ''/'' sign/NN for/IN almost/RB 10/CD min/NN ./.
as/IN the/DT staff/NN worked/VBD hard/JJ to/TO not/RB make/VB eye/JJ contact/NN with/IN us/PRP ./.
We/PRP ultimately/RB had/VBD to/TO ask/VB the/DT busser/NN if/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT host/NN ./.
Half/NNP the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD empty/NN ./.
They/PRP easily/VBP could/MD have/VB acknowledged/VBN us/PRP ,/, sat/JJ us/PRP ,/, offered/VBD chips/NNS and/CC told/VBD us/PRP the/DT kitchen/NN was/VBD behind/NN ./.
Instead/RB they/PRP chose/VBP to/TO completely/RB ignore/VB us/PRP making/VB us/PRP feel/VB as/IN if/IN they/PRP wanted/VBP us/PRP to/TO just/RB turn/VB around/IN and/CC walk/NN out/IN ./.
We/PRP took/VBD the/DT hint/NN and/CC went/VBD to/TO Pepe/NNP 's/POS Taco/NNP Villa/NNP where/WRB they/PRP made/VBD us/PRP feel/VBD at/IN home/NN ./.
Arrived/VBN here/RB for/IN lunch/NN off/IN peak/NN (/NN 2:00/CD )/NNS and/CC the/DT place/NN showed/VBD signs/NNS of/IN being/VBG super/NN busy/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD a/DT wee/JJ bit/NN dirty/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD only/RB us/RB and/CC another/DT party/NN and/CC they/PRP did/VBD start/RB catching/VBG up/RP on/IN the/DT bussing/NN while/IN we/PRP were/VBD eating/VBG ./.
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, BEST/NNP Mexican/NNP I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
Anywhere/RB ./.
The/DT guac/NN is/VBZ something/NN special/NN and/CC different/JJ ./.
See/NNP the/DT photo/NN ./.
The/DT pork/NN shoulder/NN and/CC steak/JJ w/chimichurri/NN sauce/NN were/VBD amazing/VBG ,/, even/RB the/DT simple/NN rice/NN side/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD like/IN the/DT steak/JJ taco/NN better/JJR than/IN the/DT pork/NN but/CC the/DT favors/NNS were/VBD very/RB different/JJ ./.
The/DT salsabar/NN was/VBD a/DT real/JJ treat/NN !/.
So/IN many/JJ things/NNS to/TO try/NNS ./.
Will/NNP be/VBD back/RB next/JJ time/NN in/IN town/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN here/RB twice/JJ and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ consistently/RB excellent/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT shark/NN taco/NN ,/, mahi/NNP mahi/NNP taco/NN and/CC veggie/NN taco/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO bribe/JJ my/NN meat-loving-high-cholesterol-fighting/NN mother/NN into/IN ``/`` splitting/JJ ''/'' the/DT mahi/NN mahi/NN and/CC veggie/NN taco/NN 's/POS with/IN me/PRP ./.
She/PRP loved/VBD them/PRP ,/, too/RB !/.
The/DT horchata/NN is/VBZ like/IN nothing/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN experienced/JJ ./.
Love/NNP the/DT fresh/JJ fruit/NN and/CC nuts/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ a/DT tastebud/JJ orgy/NN of/IN sheer/NN delight/NN and/CC a/DT playground/NN for/IN foodies/NNS who/WP love/JJ complexity/NN of/IN flavor/NN ./.
But/CC best/JJS of/IN all/DT .../NN for/IN 2/CD tacos/NNS ,/, a/DT little/JJ side/NN of/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS ,/, chips/NNS ,/, two/CD BIG/NNP drinks/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD only/RB $/$ 16/CD !/.
Plus/RB ,/, we/PRP listened/VBD to/TO The/DT Smiths/NNP and/CC old/JJ Mexican/NNP folk/NN music/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN rocks/VBZ ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC for/IN those/DT reviewers/NNS who/WP were/VBD frightened/VBN by/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN ,/, get/VBD over/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP live/VBP 5/JJ blocks/NNS in/IN a/DT historic/JJ neighborhood/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ as/RB safe/JJ as/IN a/DT city/NN can/MD get/VB ./.
If/IN you/PRP come/VBP for/IN lunch/NN ,/, you/PRP just/RB might/MD take/VB a/DT walk/NN a/DT couple/NN blocks/VBZ up/RP to/TO get/VB a/DT poleta/NN for/IN desert/NN ./.
16th/JJ st/NN between/IN McDowell/NNP and/CC Thomas/NNP has/VBZ successfully/RB embraced/VBN its/PRP$ roots/NNS to/TO create/VB a/DT truly/RB positive/JJ cultural/JJ experience/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT green/JJ chili/NN chilequilles/NNS with/IN poached/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC a/DT margarita/NN with/IN a/DT corona/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ and/CC the/DT drink/NN was/VBD superb/JJ but/CC what/WP really/RB impacted/VBN our/PRP$ first/JJ time/NN experience/NN was/VBD the/DT wait/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD about/IN 5-10/CD min/NN to/TO get/VB water/NN but/CC she/PRP did/VBD bring/VB our/PRP$ chips/NNS out/IN first/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP small/JJ plastic/JJ to/TO go/VB cups/NNS for/IN salsa/NN which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT inconvenience/NN to/TO keep/VB going/VBG back/RB and/CC forth/NN for/IN refills/NNS ,/, not/RB to/TO mention/NN half/NN of/IN the/DT sauces/NNS were/VBD bland/NN ,/, (/NNP had/VBD no/DT flavor/NN )/NN ./.
At/IN this/DT point/NN we/PRP ate/VBP two/CD baskets/NNS of/IN chips/NNS and/CC still/RB did/VBD n't/RB get/VB our/PRP$ drinks/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP from/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
Our/NNP food/NN actually/RB came/VBD our/PRP$ first/JJ then/RB finally/RB my/JJ margarita/NN and/CC two/CD mechiladas/NNS came/VBD ./.
We/PRP ate/VBP half/DT our/JJ food/NN as/IN the/DT chips/NNS filled/VBD us/PRP up/RP from/IN waiting/VBG so/RB long/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN needs/VBZ immediate/JJ attention/NN ./.
Another/DT issue/NN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD that/IN the/DT ladies/NNS room/NN had/VBD no/DT hand/NN soap/NN so/IN I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO let/VB the/DT staff/NN now/RB ./.
Should/NNP n't/RB they/PRP check/VBP this/DT prior/NN to/TO opening/VB ?/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ unsanitary/JJ if/IN the/DT staff/NN goes/VBZ to/TO the/DT restroom/NN and/CC touches/NNS food/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD give/VB it/PRP one/CD more/RBR try/JJ but/CC I/PRP 'd/MD go/VB if/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB in/IN a/DT hurry/JJ to/TO go/VB anywhere/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP on/IN a/DT short/JJ lunch/NN break/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB come/VB here/RB unless/IN you/PRP 're/VBP ok/JJ with/IN showing/NNP real/NNP late/JJ to/TO work/NN ./.
Hopefully/RB I/PRP can/MD leave/VB a/DT better/JJR review/NN next/IN time/NN I/PRP visit/NN ./.

Otherwise/RB our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD nice/JJ .../: ./. btw/NN there/EX was/VBD only/RB a/DT couple/NN dining/NN and/CC three/CD girls/NNS ./.
They/PRP place/VBP was/VBD n't/RB packed/VBN so/RB I/PRP should/MD n't/RB have/VB waiting/JJ about/IN 25-39/CD minutes/NNS for/IN my/PRP$ drinks/NNS and/CC food/NN (/NN -_-/JJ )/NN
I/PRP had/VBD lunch/NN at/IN La/NNP Santisima/NNP today/NN ./.

Mole/NNP '/POS taco/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN on/IN the/DT chocolatey/NN side/NN .../: Cochintia/NNP pibIL/NNP was/VBD not/RB spicy/JJ as/IN usual/JJ and/CC Al/NNP pAstor/NNP was/VBD on/IN point/NN ./.

Well/NNP ,/, La/NNP Condesa/NNP is/VBZ not/RB in/IN an/DT area/NN where/WRB I/PRP would/MD take/VB an/DT after/NN dark/NN stroll/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ by/IN no/DT means/NN a/DT hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN !/.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, clean/JJ ,/, well/RB decorated/VBN and/CC most/RBS importantly/RB they/PRP have/VBP a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN filled/VBD with/IN amazing/JJ salsas/NNS ,/, made/VBD fresh/JJ daily/JJ to/TO suit/NN all/DT taste/NN preferences/NNS ./.
My/NNP parents/NNP and/CC I/PRP had/VBD various/JJ burritos/NNS and/CC the/DT bill/NN was/VBD under/IN $/$ 20/CD for/IN the/DT 3/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.

To/TO make/VB the/DT evening/NN even/RB more/JJR exciting/JJ ,/, I/PRP accidentally/RB spilled/VBD my/PRP$ water/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN and/CC knocked/VBD a/DT painting/VBG off/RP the/DT wall/NN when/WRB I/PRP stood/VBD up/RP to/TO leave/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD return/VB to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN not/RB only/RB because/IN i/JJ feel/NN guilty/NN that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN lost/VBD revenue/NN by/IN us/PRP dining/VBG there/RB ,/, both/DT through/NNS extra/JJ takeout/NN and/CC damage/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD also/RB excellent/JJ !/.

My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP just/RB ca/VBP n't/RB get/VB over/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC salsa/NN bar/NN here/RB !/.
So/RB many/JJ amazing/VBG flavors/NNS of/IN salsas/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ salsas/NNS here/RB were/VBD the/DT Guacamole/NNP salsa/NN (/NN has/VBZ some/DT heat/NN )/NNS and/CC Mexicana/NNP salsa/NNP (/NNP salsa/NNP Mexicana/NNP ,/, lots/NNS of/IN lime/NN flavor/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Dogfish/NNP Shark/NNP taco/NN based/VBN on/IN reviews/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT filet/NN mignon/NN taco/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB overly/RB impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT shark/NN taco/NN ,/, there/EX were/VBD n't/RB any/DT flavors/NNS that/WDT distinguished/JJ it/PRP from/IN just/RB a/DT regular/JJ fish/JJ taco/NN ./.

The/DT beef/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN medium/NN and/CC tender/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT dressing/fixings/NNS was/VBD an/DT avocado/NN salsa/NN with/IN cranberries/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD way/VBN too/RB much/JJ food/NN to/TO fit/VB onto/NN the/DT tortilla/NN (/VBD a/DT good/JJ problem/NN to/TO have/VB )/VBN so/IN the/DT tip/NN is/VBZ to/TO eat/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT filling/NN ,/, then/RB try/VBD to/TO roll/VB it/PRP up/RB as/IN a/DT taco/NN ./.
The/DT one/CD sad/JJ thing/NN to/TO note/NN was/VBD that/IN they/PRP ran/VBD out/IN of/IN grapefruit/NN juice/NN so/IN the/DT house/NN margarita/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN it/PRP previously/RB ./.
But/CC you/PRP definitely/RB need/VBP to/TO get/VB the/DT house/NN margarita/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ./.

The/DT -1/JJ star/NN is/VBZ only/RB for/IN the/DT atmosphere/RB ,/, bad/JJ lighting/NN and/CC sound/NN system/NN (/NNS with/IN loud/JJ music/JJ )/NN ./.
Their/NNP veggie/NN tacos/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN ,/, with/IN fresh/JJ tortillas/NNS and/CC yummy/JJ salsa/NN ./.

Our/NNP server/NN looked/VBD like/IN he/PRP was/VBD n't/RB a/DT day/NN over/IN 18/CD ,/, but/CC seemed/RB like/IN he/PRP had/VBD years/NNS of/IN experience/NN ,/, and/CC very/RB nice/JJ ./.
Almost/RB hope/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB spruce/VB up/RP the/DT place/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB their/PRP$ delicious/JJ food/NN !/.
We/PRP were/VBD in/IN Phoenix/NNP for/IN Spring/NNP Training/NNP (/NNP The/DT Cubs/NNP )/NNP and/CC decided/VBD we/PRP wanted/VBD Mexican/NNP food/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ place/NN with/IN only/RB ten/VBN tables/NNS and/CC a/DT small/JJ bar/NN ./.

My/NNP profound/NN love/NN of/IN Mexican/NNP cuisine/NN and/CC a/DT bevy/NN of/IN shining/VBG Yelp/NNP reviews/NNS of/IN this/DT place/NN led/VBD me/PRP here/RB last/JJ Saturday/NNP night/NN ./.
My/NNP BF/NNP and/CC I/PRP arrived/VBD just/RB after/IN 7pm/CD ,/, which/WDT was/VBD perfect/JJ because/IN just/RB after/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT place/NN filled/VBD up-/JJ fast/NN !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ fantastic/JJ !/.
Some/DT of/IN my/NNP fave/NN 's/POS were/VBD the/DT peanut/NN ,/, chipotle/NN ,/, strawberry/NN and/CC a/DT chunky/NN dark/JJ one/CD who/WP 's/POS name/NN escapes/VBZ me/PRP .../: ../NN
But/CC really/IN they/PRP were/VBD all/DT good/JJ ./.
The/DT very/NN best/RB taco/NN that/IN we/PRP tried/VBP was/VBD the/DT Cochinita/NNP Pibil/NNP (/NNP sp/VB ?/. )/.
It/PRP was/VBD heavenly-/JJ packed/VBN with/IN meat/NN that/IN had/VBD a/DT kind/NN of/IN smokey/NN ,/, kind/NN of/IN mole/chocolaty/JJ taste-/NN it/PRP was/VBD incredible/JJ ./.
All/IN the/DT taco/NN 's/POS we/PRP had/VBD were/VBN great/JJ though/NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, my/PRP$ BF/NN is/VBZ a/DT lifelong/NN connoisseur/NN of/IN quesadillas/NNS ,/, so/RB we/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT steak/JJ one/CD to/TO split/NN ./.
Holy/NNP crap-/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT monster/NN !/.
They/PRP split/VBP it/PRP up/IN for/IN us/PRP but/CC it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD of/IN them/PRP !/.

It/PRP resembled/VBD a/DT strudel/NN pastry/NN !/.

I/PRP dunno/VBP ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD to/TO die/VB for/IN !/.
Even/RB the/DT next/JJ day/NN when/WRB we/PRP reheated/VBD our/PRP$ leftovers/NNS this/DT cheesy/NN doughy/NN meaty/NN concoction/NN was/VBD still/RB fantastic/JJ !/.

(/JJ Maybe/NNP because/IN it/PRP didnt/VBD have/VBP to/TO compete/VB with/IN any/DT tacos/NNS )/VBP !/.
All/DT in/IN all/DT we/NNS were/VBD very/RB satisfied/JJ and/CC will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/VBN I/PRP only/RB gave/VBD it/PRP four/CD stars/NNS ./.
The/DT tacos/NNS here/RB are/VBP to/TO die/VB for../NN

The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB insane/JJ ,/, lots/NNS of/IN real/JJ spicy/NN options../NN Kitchy/NNP ,/, inexpensive/JJ ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP a/DT must/NN for/IN locals/NNS to/TO take/VB your/PRP$ tourists/NNS as/IN that/DT ``/`` hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN ''/'' place/NN with/IN some/DT real/JJ spunk/NN and/CC guster..Pack/NN some/DT heat../NN Its/VBD the/DT Ghetto/NN :/: )/.

Food/NNP :/: The/DT food/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB excellent/JJ ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP trying/VBG 4/CD different/JJ tacos/NNS during/IN my/PRP$ visit/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD all/DT very/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Mayan/NNP Cochinita/NNP Pibil/NNP ,/, La/NNP Condesa/NNP Veggie/NNP Taco/NNP ,/, the/DT whitefish/JJ taco/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT Gaucho/NNP taco/NN ./.

The/DT steak/NN in/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB well/RB done/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT flavors/NNS went/VBD well/RB with/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
I/PRP could/MD have/VB used/VBN some/DT more/JJR chimichurri/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD tasty/JJ nonetheless/JJ ./.
The/DT cochinita/NN pibil/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
The/DT whitefish/JJ taco/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ bland/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD n't/RB have/VB minded/VBN some/DT stronger/JJR flavors/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.
And/CC the/DT veggie/NN taco/NN was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ --/: right/RB up/IN there/RB with/IN the/DT cochinita/NN pibil/NN ./.
The/DT rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS ,/, though/IN not/RB the/DT star/NN of/IN the/DT show/NN ,/, were/VBD really/RB good/JJ !/.
I/PRP liked/VBD that/IN the/DT rice/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ ``/`` stickier/NN ''/'' than/IN most/JJS rice/NN you/PRP find/VBP outside/IN of/IN more/JJR Asian-type/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.

When/WRB I/PRP first/RB opened/VBD the/DT menu/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD very/RB conflicted/VBN over/IN what/WP to/TO order/NN ./.

Despite/IN there/EX being/VBG nobody/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN me/PRP waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT table/JJ when/WRB I/PRP arrived/VBD ,/, it/PRP took/VBD about/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS of/IN waiting/VBG to/TO get/VB a/DT table/JJ ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT experience/NN and/CC will/MD be/VB back/RB ./.

My/NNP boyfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD here/RB for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN today/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, and/CC so/RB is/VBZ the/DT service/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB fried/JJ food/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB get/VB the/DT quesadillas/NNS ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN had/VBD the/DT horchata/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP says/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT best/NN that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ ever/RB had/VBN ./.

We/PRP were/VBD driving/VBG back/RB to/TO LA/NNP and/CC we/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT place/NN to/TO stop/VB for/IN a/DT quick/JJ but/CC yummy/JJ lunch/NN .../: ./. Found/NNP this/DT place/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP and/CC I/PRP am/VBP so/RB glad/JJ we/PRP stopped/VBP here/RB ./.
Best/NNP tacos/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Salsa/NNP bar/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
The/DT waitress/NN mixed/VBD up/RP my/PRP$ order/NN so/IN I/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN what/WP I/PRP ate/VBP but/CC it/PRP was/VBD phenominal/JJ ./.
Seriously/RB ,/, you/PRP need/VBP to/TO eat/VB here/RB ./.
Absolutely/RB delicious/JJ ./.
This/DT small/JJ place/NN does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN adequate/JJ seating/VBG but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ an/DT amazing/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
Let/NNP 's/POS get/NN something/NN straight/NN ./.
A/DT salsa/NN bar/NN consists/NNS of/IN more/JJR than/IN the/DT standard/JJ 3/NN to/TO 4/VB salsas/NNS ./.
This/DT place/NN had/VBD about/RB 20/CD ./.
You/PRP can/MD tell/VB that/IN some/DT of/IN them/PRP were/VBD experiments/NNS that/IN went/RB well/RB like/IN Peanut/NNP salsa/NN and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP there/RB was/VBD a/DT curry/JJ salsa/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD so/RB many/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT famous/JJ baja/NN sur/NN dogfish/JJ shark/NN taco/NN ,/, an/DT El/NNP Gaucho/NNP burrito/NN and/CC an/DT El/NNP Gaucho/NNP quesadilla/NNP ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN quesadillas/NNS because/IN of/IN the/DT flour/JJ tortilla/NN and/CC there/EX is/VBZ usually/RB not/RB a/DT good/JJ filling/NN ./.
This/DT one/NN was/VBD deep/JJ fried/JJ goodness/NN ./.
Oh/NNP man/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ that/IN I/PRP could/MD only/RB get/VB down/IN half/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT filling/NN was/VBD steak/JJ ,/, cucumber/NN and/CC just/RB hell/JJ goodness/NN ./.
My/NNP husband/NN 's/POS burrito/NN had/VBD majority/NN of/IN the/DT same/JJ filing/NN as/IN mine/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ tweaking/NN ./.
He/PRP enjoyed/VBD it/PRP a/DT lot/NN ./.
The/DT fish/JJ taco/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
I/PRP only/RB had/VBD one/CD bite/NN because/IN I/PRP was/VBD aggressively/RB attacking/VBG my/PRP$ quesadilla/NN and/CC fighting/VBG off/RP the/DT stares/NNS of/IN people/NNS watching/VBG me/PRP enjoy/VB ./.
With/IN all/DT that/DT being/NNP said/VBD ,/, customer/NN service/NN is/VBZ once/RB again/RB an/DT issue/NN ./.
The/DT small/JJ place/NN was/VBD pretty/RB packed/VBN ./.
Only/RB one/CD small/JJ table/JJ was/VBD open/JJ right/NN by/IN the/DT door/NN ./.
This/DT table/JJ had/NN to/TO be/VB misplacement/NN because/IN who/WP would/MD want/VB to/TO sit/NN by/IN the/DT door/NN and/CC every/DT time/NN someone/NN opens/VBZ the/DT door/NN ,/, they/PRP get/VBP smacked/VBN in/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT head/NN ?/.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD so/RB non-existent/JJ that/IN a/DT waitress/NN would/MD come/VB over/IN to/TO only/RB end/VB up/RP doing/VBG the/DT same/JJ thing/NN ./.
Sigh/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD so/RB good/JJ ;/: I/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB dock/VB any/DT points/NNS for/IN that/DT ./.
Be/NNP aware/VBP that/IN the/DT first/JJ bowl/NN of/IN chips/NNS is/VBZ free/JJ ./.
The/DT second/JJ bowl/NN is/VBZ about/IN $/$ 2/CD more/RBR ./.
The/DT chips/NNS are/VBP good/JJ and/CC hot/NN so/RB ,/, I/PRP willingly/RB gave/VBD over/IN my/JJ money/NN for/IN an/DT extra/JJ bowl/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO this/DT location/NN (/VBD went/NN to/TO the/DT Glendale/NNP one/CD twice/NN )/NN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP both/DT 5/5/CD !/.
Have/NNP n't/RB had/VBD anything/VBN bad/JJ from/IN either/DT location/NN ./.
Street/NNP tacos/NNS were/VBD great/JJ (/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD super/NN tender/NN and/CC could/MD be/VB cut/VBN with/IN a/DT fork/NN )/NN and/CC the/DT mole/NN had/VBD the/DT right/JJ combination/NN of/IN smoky/NN and/CC chocolately/RB taste/JJ ./.
Salsa/NNP bar/NN is/VBZ also/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB seen/VBN -/JJ my/NN personal/JJ favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT pecan/JJ salsa/NN ./.
The/DT cilantro/NN salsa/NN is/VBZ a/DT close/JJ second/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ funny/JJ because/IN I/PRP normally/RB HATE/VBP the/DT taste/NN of/IN fresh/JJ cilantro/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP also/RB ordered/VBN the/DT El/NNP Gaucho/NNP queso/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ basically/RB like/IN a/DT big/JJ Mexican/JJ calzone/NN ./.
Steak/NNP was/VBD prepared/VBN well/RB and/CC tender/RB and/CC the/DT outside/JJ shell/NN was/VBD perfectly/RB crisp/NN on/IN the/DT outside/NN ./.
As/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB the/DT horchata/NN was/VBD my/VBN favorite/JJ item/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ different/NN from/IN your/PRP$ normal/JJ horchata/NN as/IN it/PRP contains/VBZ walnuts/NNS ,/, strawberries/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT healthy/JJ dollop/NN of/IN cinnamon/NN on/IN top/JJ ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD strange/NN at/IN first/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP works/VBZ !/NNP !/.
Prices/NNS were/VBD very/RB reasonable/JJ too/RB (/RB 4/VBN street/NN tacos/NNS ,/, steak/JJ queso/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT horchata/NN all/NN for/IN $/$ 24/CD )/CD ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ small/JJ and/CC unassuming/JJ ,/, and/CC is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN place/NN you/PRP would/MD easily/VB miss/NN if/IN you/PRP were/VBD n't/RB looking/JJ for/IN it/PRP ./.
Also/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB small/JJ and/CC cramped/VBD in/IN there/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB the/DT food/NN and/CC drinks/NNS are/VBP this/DT good/JJ ,/, who/WP 's/POS noticing/VBG that/IN ?/.
Sure/NNP ,/, this/DT place/NN may/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT most/RBS authentic/JJ Mexican/NNP restaurant/NN (/VBD mostly/RB gringoes/VBZ up/RP in/IN here/RB )/JJ but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN since/IN moving/VBG to/TO Arizona/NNP two/CD months/NNS ago/IN !/.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN on/IN a/DT whim/JJ ./.
We/PRP looked/VBD through/IN the/DT pictures/NNS on/IN yelp/NN and/CC the/DT tacos/NNS looked/VBD great/JJ ./.
As/IN we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN we/PRP immediately/RB noticed/VBD that/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD like/IN really/RB small/JJ but/CC the/DT atmosphere/NN was/VBD laid/JJ back/RB ./.
The/DT menu/NN had/VBD a/DT huge/JJ selection/NN of/IN tacos/NNS ,/, burritos/NNS ,/, tortas/NNS and/CC quesadillas/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT specialty/NN tacos/NNS with/IN Mahi/NNP mahi/NNP ./.
Pretty/NNP good/JJ stuff/NN since/IN it/PRP came/VBD with/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS ./.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN had/VBD a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN salsas/NNS to/TO choose/VB from/IN too/RB ./.
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB randomly/RB on/IN our/PRP$ house/NN hunting/VBG trip/NN to/TO Phoenix/NNP and/CC have/VBP been/VBN going/VBG back/RB ever/RB since/IN ./.
Their/NNP food/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ as/IN is/VBZ their/PRP$ salsa/NN bar/NN ./.
We/PRP alway/VBP take/VBG out/RP of/IN town/NN guests/NNS and/CC it/PRP remains/VBZ our/PRP$ go/NN to/TO for/IN great/JJ ,/, affordable/JJ ,/, and/CC authentic/JJ Mexican/NNP food/NN !/.
La/NNP Santisima/NNP has/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ selection/NN of/IN salsas/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN and/CC especially/RB the/DT various/JJ burritos/NNS ,/, are/VBP unique/JJ and/CC taste/JJ excellent/JJ !/.
Like/IN everyone/NN else/RB said/VBD ,/, the/DT atmosphere/NN and/CC artwork/NN are/VBP what/WP really/RB make/VB the/DT place/NN !/.
We/PRP ate/VBP around/IN 7pm/CD and/CC luckily/RB we/PRP only/RB had/VBD a/DT 5/VBN minute/NN wait/NN but/CC I/PRP could/MD see/VB there/RB being/VBG a/DT long/JJ wait/NN during/IN the/DT dinner/NN rush/NN since/IN there/EX 's/VBZ limited/NN seating/NN ./.
I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP the/DT guacamole/JJ dip/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN what/WP 's/POS in/IN it/PRP but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB unique/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ (/NNS I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP has/VBZ mangoes/NNS and/CC cranberries/NNS ?/RB )/VBP ./.
I/PRP also/RB had/VBD the/DT shark/NN tacos/NNS which/WDT were/VBD good/JJ !/.
Awesome/NNP quaint/VBD taco/NN shop/NN with/IN excellent/JJ food/NN that/WDT has/VBZ real/JJ flavor/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ warm/NN and/CC are/VBP a/DT treat/NN !/.
I/PRP am/VBP from/IN California/NNP so/RB used/VBD to/TO amazing/VBG Mexican/NNP food/NN ./.
But/CC this/DT place/NN may/MD be/VB my/VBN favorite/JJ yet/NN !/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT beef/NN quesadilla/NN which/WDT was/VBD prepared/VBN differently/RB than/IN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB seen/VBN ./.
Fried/JJ large/JJ corn/NN tortillas/NNS with/IN yummy/JJ tender/NN steak/NN and/CC cheese/NN inside/NN ./.
Wish/NNP I/PRP had/VBD room/VBN to/TO eat/VB the/DT whole/JJ huge/JJ thing/NN !/.
Also/RB sangria/NN was/VBD a/DT work/NN of/IN art/NN ./.
And/CC totally/RB reasonably/RB priced/VBN ./.
Plus/NNP really/RB nice/JJ people/NNS ./.
So/IN happy/JJ I/PRP followed/VBP yelp/JJ to/TO this/DT wonderful/JJ place/NN !/.
Very/NNP good/NNP ./.
From/NNP the/DT hot/NN chips/NNS to/TO the/DT variety/NN of/IN salsas/NNS great/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT steak/JJ taco/NN and/CC shrimp/NN taco/NN excellent/JJ seasoning/NN ,/, piping/VBG hot/NN and/CC nice/JJ waiter/NN ./.
Be/NNP prepared/VBD to/TO squeeze/VB in/IN close/JJ to/TO your/PRP$ neighbors/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB worth/JJ it/PRP !/.
The/DT salsa/NN bar/NN is/VBZ fantastic/JJ !/.
I/PRP ordered/VBP take-out/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ n't/RB their/PRP$ forte/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD not/RB offered/VBD a/DT seat/NN ,/, nothing/NN to/TO drink/VB ,/, and/CC generally/RB had/VBD to/TO figure/VB out/RP whom/JJ to/TO address/NN to/TO place/NN my/NN order/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT salsa/NN bar/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB I/PRP got/VBD there/RB -/JJ around/IN dinner/JJ time/NN -/IN the/DT salsas/NNS were/VBD mostly/RB gone/JJ ./.
There/EX are/VBP at/IN least/JJS two/CD salsas/NNS worth/JJ writing/NN about/RB ,/, but/CC there/EX were/VBD no/DT cups/lids/NNS to/TO take/VB the/DT salsa/NN with/IN me/PRP ./.
Upon/NNP request/NNP ,/, they/PRP provided/VBP me/PRP four/CD one-ounce/NN cups/NNS with/IN four/CD lids/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP did/VBD get/VB to/TO try/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN four/CD types/NNS of/IN salsa/NN ,/, period/NN ./.
The/DT fish/JJ tacos/NNS were/VBD odd/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT smoked/JJ swordfish/JJ actually/RB tasted/VBN yum/NN ./.
NOT/NNP for/IN $/$ 9+/CD though/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT reason/NN for/IN the/DT low/JJ star/NN review/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, you/PRP could/MD n't/RB convince/VB me/PRP to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT second/JJ try/NN ./.
Bad/NNP service/NN -/VBD the/DT servers/staff/NN seemed/VBD too/RB busy/JJ to/TO help/VB (/NN service/NN is/VBZ a/DT biggie/JJ )/NN ./.
Recommend/IN you/PRP go/VBP into/IN the/DT insurance/NN business/NN with/IN your/JJ people/NNS skills/NNS ./.
This/DT place/NN MUST/RB have/VBP paid/VBN for/IN their/PRP$ reviews/NNS ./.
./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ I/PRP 'll/MD eventually/RB see/VB this/DT review/NN being/VBG removed/VBN ./.
Service/NNP here/RB is/VBZ beyond/IN horrible/JJ ./.
It/PRP took/VBD a/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO us/PRP 10/CD minutes/NNS before/IN being/VBG greeted/VBN ./.
Keep/NNP in/IN mind/NN ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ only/RB about/IN 10/CD tables/NNS in/IN the/DT whole/JJ place../NN All/NN in/IN one/CD small/JJ room/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ bland/NN ./.
Gross/NNP ./.
The/DT steak/JJ taco/NN and/CC burro/NN we/PRP ordered/VBP were/VBD both/DT full/JJ of/IN gristle/NN ./.
Also/RB got/VBD a/DT specialty/NN burro/NN with/IN shrimp/NN ./.
Blah/NNP ./.
All/DT bland/NN with/IN no/DT flavor/NN ./.
For/IN having/JJ menu/NN prices/NNS on/IN the/DT higher/JJR end/NN of/IN the/DT spectrum/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD expect/VB a/DT better/JJR location/NN ./.
Scary/NNP !/VBD !/CD !/.
The/DT only/JJ deserving/VBG star/NN for/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ salsa/NN 's/POS ./.
They/PRP do/VBP a/DT good/JJ job/NN with/IN the/DT salsa/NN ,/, I/PRP must/MD admit/VB ./.
But/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB see/VB myself/JJ going/VBG somewhere/RB JuSt/NNP for/IN the/DT complimentary/JJ salsa/NN ./.
Do/NNP yourself/VBD a/DT favor/NN and/CC go/VB a/DT couple/NN blocks/VBZ over/IN to/TO EL/NNP Nopalito/NNP 's/POS
The/DT things/NNS I/PRP like/VBP best/JJ about/IN La/NNP Condesa/NNP (/VBD other/JJ than/IN the/DT decor/NN -/JJ I/PRP love/VBP the/DT imagery/NN of/IN Dia/NNP de/IN los/NNS Muertos/NNPS and/CC Catrina/NNP )/NN :/: their/PRP$ delicious/JJ homemade/NN horchata/NN ,/, garnished/VBD authentically/RB with/IN bits/NNS of/IN melon/NN and/CC pecans/NNS ;/: their/PRP$ many/JJ unusual/JJ varieties/NNS of/IN homemade/NN salsas/NNS (/VBP jicama/NN ,/, peanut/NN ,/, pecan/JJ ,/, berry/JJ ,/, every/DT type/NN of/IN chile/tomato/NN combination/NN .../: All/DT of/IN them/PRP tasty/JJ )/NN ;/: and/CC their/PRP$ thick-rolled/JJ ,/, flavorful/JJ quesas/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT land/NN of/IN a/DT thousand/NN Mexican/NNP restaurants/NNS ,/, they/PRP bring/VBD a/DT fresh/JJ spin/NN to/TO the/DT cuisine/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ awesome/NN ./.
Totally/RB worth/JJ bumping/NN elbows/VBZ with/IN one/CD 's/POS fellow/JJ patrons/NNS a/DT bit/NN in/IN the/DT tight/JJ dining/NN room/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP may/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT pipe/NN dream/NN to/TO think/VB that/IN because/IN Phoenix/NNP is/VBZ closer/NN to/TO the/DT Mexican/NNP border/NN that/IN we/PRP may/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO find/VB better/JJR Mexican/NNP restaurants/NNS here/RB ./.
But/CC the/DT theory/JJ proved/JJ true/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP from/IN Minneapolis/NNP ,/, where/WRB good/JJ Mexican/NNP places/NNS are/VBP few/JJ and/CC far/RB between/IN ,/, the/DT only/RB good/JJ one/CD I/PRP can/MD think/VB of/IN being/VBG Los/NNP Ocampo/NNP ./.
This/DT place/NN had/VBD the/DT best/JJS salsa/NN bar/NN I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN yet/RB ./.
The/DT steak/NN tacos/VBZ I/PRP had/VBD were/VBD excellent/JJ ;/: the/DT meat/NN was/VBD moist/JJ and/CC flavorful/JJ with/IN no/DT gristle/NN and/CC little/JJ fat/NN ./.
They/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN even/RB better/JJR with/IN a/DT little/JJ cilantro/NN though/IN ./.
The/DT rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS were/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ;/: the/DT rice/NN was/VBD a/DT tad/JJ soft/wet/NN but/CC the/DT flavor/NN was/VBD spot/NN on/IN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD margaritas/RB ,/, apparently/RB on/IN special/JJ ,/, for/IN only/RB $/$ 3/CD a/DT pop/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD tasty/JJ but/CC strong/JJ enough-enough/NN that/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO let/VB my/PRP$ husband/NN finish/JJ mine/NN off/IN because/IN I/PRP was/VBD driving/VBG ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP would/MD say/VB needs/JJ improvement/NN is/VBZ the/DT ambiance/NN ;/: my/NNP chair/NN was/VBD uncomfortable/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ to/TO scoot/NN in/IN and/CC out/IN from/IN the/DT table/JJ ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT big/JJ pain/NN and/CC drew/VBD attention/NN to/TO us/PRP when/WRB I/PRP attempted/VBD to/TO nurse/VB our/PRP$ baby/NN ./.
The/DT chairs/NNS could/MD use/VB reupholstering/VBG too/RB ./.
Tip/NN :/: their/PRP$ parking/NN is/VBZ out/RP front/JJ but/CC easy/JJ to/TO miss/NN when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP driving/VBG down/IN 16th/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT busy/NN thoroughfare/NN with/IN a/DT speed/VBN limit/NN of/IN 45/CD (/NNS ?/. )/.
do/VBP n't/RB quote/VB me/PRP on/IN that/IN but/CC people/NNS drive/VBP FAST/NNP ./.
My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN a/DT late/JJ lunch/early/NN dinner/NN today/NN (/VBD Sunday/NNP )/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB small/JJ and/CC kind/JJ of/IN feels/NNS like/IN you/PRP 're/VBP at/IN a/DT friends/NNS house/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ change/NN of/IN pace/NN ./.
Pros/NNS :/: The/DT food/NN was/VBD GREAT/NNP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT veggie/NN quesadilla/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD more/RBR like/IN a/DT Mexican/NNP calzone-/NN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO eat/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT fork/NN ./.
Seriously/RB so/RB much/JJ flavor/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD big/JJ enough/JJ to/TO eat/VB half/NN and/CC save/NN for/IN later/JJ but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT bad/JJ ass/NN and/CC ate/NN almost/RB all/DT of/IN it/PRP because/IN that/DT 's/VBZ how/WRB I/PRP roll/VBP ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD (/IN the/DT picky/JJ one/CD )/NN had/VBD a/DT carne/NN Asada/NN burrito-/NN just/RB steak/JJ ,/, beans/NNS and/CC cheese/NN plus/NNS he/PRP added/VBD sour/JJ cream/NN ./.
Two/CD bites/NNS in/IN we/PRP were/VBD already/RB making/JJ plans/NNS to/TO come/VB back/RB ./.
There/EX were/VBD plenty/NN of/IN vegetarian/JJ and/CC vegan/JJ options/NNS so/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP excited/VBN to/TO go/VB back/RB and/CC try/RB something/NN different/JJ next/JJ time/NN !/.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT huge/JJ salsa/NN bar/NN but/CC half/NN of/IN the/DT salsas/NNS were/VBD missing/VBG descriptions/NNS so/IN it/PRP was/VBD kind/NN of/IN a/DT guessing/JJ game/NN ./.
The/DT horchata/NN was/VBD huge/JJ and/CC came/VBD with/IN fresh/JJ fruit/NN ,/, nuts/NNS and/CC cinnamon/NN on/IN top/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC not/RB as/RB thick/JJ as/IN expected/VBN (/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB a/DT white/JJ girl/NN from/IN Kansas/NNP so/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB an/DT expert/NN )/NN ./.
Cons/NNS :/: Parking/NNP can/MD be/VB a/DT pain-/JJ I/NN tried/VBD to/TO come/VB on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN and/CC eventually/RB gave/VBD up/IN because/IN I/PRP was/VBD already/RB in/IN a/DT bad/JJ mood/NN ./.
The/DT chips/NNS were/VBD nothing/VBN special/JJ and/CC salt/JJ would/MD not/RB stay/VB on/IN !/.
They/PRP were/VBD free/JJ though/IN so/RB not/RB holding/VBG that/IN against/IN them/PRP ./.
From/NNP the/DT one/CD $/NN ,/, I/PRP expected/VBP the/DT prices/NNS to/TO be/VB cheaper/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB even/RB sure/VB if/IN there/NN would/MD be/VB waiter/JJ service/NN ./.
For/IN a/DT burrito/NN ,/, quesadilla/NNP ,/, horchata/NN and/CC two/CD negra/NN models/NNS (/VBP on/IN special/JJ )/NN it/PRP came/VBD to/TO $/$ 32/CD and/CC change/CD plus/NNS tip/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD very/RB satisfied/JJ and/CC will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
What/NN is/VBZ there/RB to/TO say/VB about/IN La/NNP Condesa/NNP ?/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ simply/RB amazing/VBG ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP admit/JJ ,/, we/PRP found/VBD this/DT place/NN searching/NN for/IN more/JJR of/IN a/DT day-to-day/JJ ,/, less/JJR expensive/JJ version/NN of/IN Barrio/NNP Cafe/NNP ./.
We/PRP found/VBD that/IN and/CC more/JJR ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ one/CD month/NN since/IN we/PRP 've/VBP moved/VBN to/TO Phoenix/NNP ,/, we/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN here/RB three/CD times/NNS ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT best/JJS item/NN we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN is/VBZ the/DT fried/JJ quesadilla/NN with/IN mole/JJ chicken/NN ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT horchata/NN ./.
Best/NNP ./.
Horchata/NNP ./.
Ever/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB your/JJ typical/JJ horchata/NN ,/, so/RB watch/RB out/IN ./.
Mole/NNP poblano/NN tacos/NNS are/VBP also/RB heaven/VBN ,/, as/IN is/VBZ the/DT cochinita/NN pibil/NN ./.
Salsa/NNP bar/NN is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN vibe/NN ./.
Only/RB bad/JJ moment/NN was/VBD that/IN I/PRP got/VBD trapped/VBN in/IN the/DT bathroom/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD my/JJ fault/NN ./.
I/PRP swear/VBP the/DT door/NN opens/VBZ out/RP ,/, not/RB in/IN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ super/NN casual/NN ./.
Plastic/JJ cups/NNS and/CC nothing/NN fancy/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT vibe/NN is/VBZ uber/JJ awesome/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB small/JJ ,/, and/CC seating/NN can/MD be/VB limited/VBN ,/, but/CC it/PRP always/RB seems/VBZ to/TO work/VB out/RP ./.
