This/DT place/NN is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC a/DT little/JJ pricy/NN I/PRP think/VBP ./.
Although/IN they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP some/DT drink/JJ specials/NNS and/CC a/DT pot/NN of/IN mussels/NNS for/IN about/RB 13-15/CD pounds/NNS ./.
But/CC once/RB you/PRP start/VBP ordering/VBG appetizers/NNS or/CC any/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ entrees/NNS ,/, it/PRP can/MD get/VB pretty/RB pricey/JJ pretty/RB fast/RB ./.

Both/IN the/DT seafood/NN and/CC steak/NN were/VBD good/JJ quality/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP guess/VBP they/PRP were/VBD just/RB a/DT bit/JJ boring/NN ./.
Boyfriend/NNP wasnt/VBD so/RB keen/VBN on/IN the/DT strange/NN warm/NN ,/, limp/NN cabbage/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT steak/NN ./.
Although/IN the/DT steak/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN as/IN ordered/JJ (/NNS medium-rare/JJ )/NN which/WDT was/VBD good/JJ ./.

The/DT steak/NN was/VBD fine/NN but/CC next/JJ time/NN we/PRP are/VBP just/RB doing/VBG mussels/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ really/RB their/PRP$ thing/NN ./.
Not/RB five/CD stars/NNS as/IN they/PRP just/RB opened/VBP (/JJ second/JJ location/NN )/NN and/CC fumbled/VBD a/DT bit/NN with/IN forgetfulness/NN and/CC delays/NNS ./.
The/DT staff/NN and/CC owner/NN were/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC apologetic/JJ ./.
Highly/RB recommended/VBD ./.
I/PRP must/MD say/VB the/DT name/NN of/IN this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ straight/JJ to/TO the/DT point/NN and/CC those/DT two/CD things/NNS are/VBP exactly/RB what/WP my/PRP$ friend/NN and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD alright/JJ ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP definitely/RB had/VBD better/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP will/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT mussels/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB damn/JJ good/JJ ./.
Very/NNP flavorful/JJ and/CC piping/JJ hot/NN when/WRB they/PRP arrived/VBD at/IN the/DT table/JJ ./.
They/PRP were/VBD n't/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT ones/NNS I/PRP had/VBD in/IN Belgium/NNP ,/, but/CC they/PRP definitely/RB were/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD also/RB plenty/JJ to/TO share/NN for/IN two/CD people/NNS ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN is/VBZ n't/RB all/DT that/DT fancy/NN but/CC their/PRP$ service/NN is/VBZ ./.
They/PRP make/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP 're/VBP taken/VBN care/NN of/IN throughout/NN the/DT entire/JJ meal/NN ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, you/PRP must/MD get/VB the/DT Banoffee/NNP Pie/NNP ./.

They/PRP are/VBP too/RB strong/JJ and/CC too/RB fishy/JJ !/.

Until/IN now/RB I/PRP would/MD have/VB told/VBN you/PRP that/IN I/PRP 'd/MD rather/RB eat/VB rattlesnake/NN ./.

Our/NNP travel/VBD mate/NN ordered/IN the/DT mussel/NN starter/NN ./.

OMG/NNP ,/, it/PRP smelled/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
So/RB much/RB so/IN that/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO taste/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT little/JJ mussels/NNS were/VBD tender/VBN and/CC steamed/VBD to/TO perfection/NN with/IN a/DT light/JJ pesto/NN sauce/NN driselled/VBD over/IN them/PRP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ such/JJ a/DT great/JJ combination/NN !/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT surf/NN and/CC turf/NN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
The/DT mussels/NNS were/VBD done/VBN in/IN white/JJ wine/NN and/CC garlic/NN and/CC the/DT ribeye/NN steak/NN was/VBD tender/RB ,/, juicey/NN and/CC cooked/VBD exactly/RB as/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP it/PRP ./.
All/DT four/NN of/IN us/PRP agreed/VBD that/IN our/PRP$ meals/NNS were/VBD delightful/JJ ./.
The/DT price/NN was/VBD not/RB out/IN of/IN line/NN ./.

Most/JJS of/IN the/DT group/NN ordered/VBD starters/NNS &/CC the/DT haggis/NN dish/NN was/VBD the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ ./.
I/PRP saved/VBD myself/NN for/IN the/DT 6oz/CD rump/NN steak/NN which/WDT was/VBD awesome/JJ ./.
The/DT chips/NNS were/VBD chunky/JJ &/CC crispy/NN ,/, just/RB how/WRB I/PRP like/VBP them/PRP &/CC the/DT mushrooms/NNS were/VBD earthy/JJ &/CC full/JJ of/IN flavour/NN ./.
My/NNP steak/NN was/VBD perfectly/RB cooked/VBN ,/, moist/NN &/CC melt/NN in/IN the/DT mouth/NN ./.
A/DT colleague/NN had/VBD the/DT seafood/NN curry/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD full/JJ of/IN enormous/JJ mussels/NNS &/CC other/JJ fishy/JJ delights/NNS ./.
It/PRP smelled/VBD amazing/VBG &/CC he/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD the/DT best/JJS fish/JJ curry/JJ he/PRP 's/VBZ had/VBD ./.
The/DT only/JJ problem/NN being/VBG that/IN it/PRP took/VBD so/RB long/RB to/TO arrive/VB he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB time/VBN to/TO finish/VB it/PRP before/IN having/VBG to/TO get/VB back/RB to/TO work/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB the/DT service/NN was/VBD slow/JJ and/CC I/PRP we/VBP all/DT had/VBD to/TO skip/NN dessert/NN &/CC coffee/NN as/IN we/PRP needed/VBD to/TO get/VB back/RB to/TO the/DT office/NN (/NN despite/IN being/VBG there/RB over/IN 90/CD mins/NNS )/RB ./.
A/DT lovely/JJ lunch/NN with/IN great/JJ food/NN &/CC company/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT shame/NN the/DT slow/NN service/NN meant/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT wee/JJ bit/NN stressful/NN ./.
The/DT front/NN of/IN house/NN staff/NN were/VBD lovely/RB maybe/JJ they/PRP just/RB need/VBP another/DT pair/NN of/IN hands/NNS in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./.
On/IN our/PRP$ last/JJ day/NN in/IN Edinburgh/NNP ,/, I/PRP still/RB had/VBD n't/RB tried/VBN Haggis/NNP ./.
And/CC I/PRP really/RB wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT waitresses/NNS we/PRP excited/VBD to/TO watch/NNP me/NNP try/NNP it/PRP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD chatty/NN but/CC not/RB overly/RB ./.
They/PRP were/VBD attentive/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB overly/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ time/NN ,/, but/CC next/JJ time/NN I/PRP 'd/MD like/VB to/TO take/VB my/JJ time/NN and/CC order/NN more/RBR and/CC stay/RB longer/RBR ./.
An/DT excellent/JJ experience/NN -/JJ all/DT of/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD of/IN a/DT high/JJ quality/NN ,/, as/IN was/VBD the/DT service../NN
Whether/NNP it/PRP was/VBD scallops/NNS ,/, mussels/NNS ,/, oysters/NNS or/CC plaice/NN ,/, the/DT seafood/NN was/VBD first/JJ class/NN and/CC as/RB fresh/JJ as/IN the/DT sea/NN itself/NN ./.
Steaks/NNS were/VBD also/RB delicious/JJ ,/, both/DT ribeye/NN and/CC sirloin/NN ./.
The/DT wine/NN choices/NNS worked/VBD well/RB with/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT choice/NN of/IN whiskies/NNS suited/VBN our/PRP$ need/NN to/TO try/VB something/NN different/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB for/IN the/DT langoustines/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB ./.
They/PRP were/VBD nicely/RB cooked/VBN and/CC flavored/VBN with/IN garlic/JJ butter/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ course/NN of/IN mussels/NNS came/VBD with/IN at/IN least/JJS 30/CD ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD delicious/JJ as/IN well/RB (/IN we/PRP had/VBD the/DT chili/NN seasoning/VBG )/NN ./.
Others/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ group/NN had/VBD steaks/NNS that/IN were/VBD nicely/RB cooked/VBN (/NN medium/NN rare/JJ )/NN and/CC tasty/NN --/: great/JJ chips/NNS ,/, too/RB ./.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ casual/JJ with/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT other/JJ wait/NN staff/NNS picked/VBD up/RP the/DT slack/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD an/DT excellent/JJ Edinburgh/NNP meal/NN ,/, with/IN ingredients/NNS that/WDT featured/VBD the/DT best/JJS that/DT Scotland/NNP has/VBZ to/TO offer/NN ./.
Very/NNP easy/VBD to/TO find/NNP ./.
Seafood/NNP place/NN with/IN reasonable/JJ price/NN ./.
We/PRP enjoyed/VBD both/DT the/DT mussel/NN and/CC steak/NN :/: )/.
One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS spots/NNS for/IN seafood/NN in/IN Edinburgh/NNP ,/, and/CC one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
Located/NNP just/RB across/IN the/DT street/NN from/IN a/DT longer/JJ strip/NN of/IN restaurants/NNS and/CC pubs/NNS in/IN the/DT Grassmarket/NNP ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO pass/VB the/DT Mussels/NNS Steak/NNP Bar/NNP without/IN giving/NNP it/PRP a/DT second/JJ thought/NN ./.
That/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT huge/JJ mistake/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP made/VBN about/IN 12/CD trips/NNS here/RB for/IN lunch/NN and/CC dinner/NN ,/, and/CC every/DT time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP always/RB been/VBN greeted/VBN by/IN an/DT unbelievably/JJ friendly/JJ waiter/NN or/CC waitress/NN ./.
They/PRP start/VBP you/PRP off/RP with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS crusty/NN bread/NN and/CC softest/RB whipped/VBD butter/NN you/PRP 'll/MD ever/RB taste/VB ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP happy/JJ to/TO replenish/VB it/PRP many/JJ times/NNS over/IN ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ way/NN to/TO start/VB a/DT meal/NN is/VBZ with/IN a/DT kilo/NN pot/NN of/IN their/PRP$ mussels/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP all/DT ridiculously/RB fresh/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ,/, particularly/RB with/IN the/DT white/JJ wine/NN ,/, shallots/NNS ,/, garlic/NN and/CC cream/NN sauce/NN ./.
Both/IN the/DT steaks/NNS and/CC the/DT seafood/NN pasta/NN (/NNS with/IN loads/NNS of/IN mussels/NNS ,/, scallops/NNS ,/, prawns/NNS ,/, and/CC calamari/NN )/NNS are/VBP excellent/JJ main/JJ courses/NNS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ fries/NNS with/IN 'beef/JJ dripping/JJ '/NNS are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB tasted/VBN ./.
Their/NNP wine/NNP list/NN is/VBZ not/RB huge/JJ but/CC offers/RB good/JJ selection/NN at/IN reasonable/JJ prices/NNS ./.
The/DT meal/NN can/MD definitely/RB run/VB on/IN the/DT pricey/NN end/NN depending/VBG on/IN the/DT conversion/NN rate/NN (/NN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP an/DT American/JJ )/NN but/CC I/PRP have/VBP never/RB walked/VBN out/IN of/IN this/DT place/NN unsatisfied/VBD ./.
Highly/RB ,/, highly/RB recommended/VBD !/.

No/DT one/CD rushed/JJ or/CC hurried/JJ us/PRP out/RP even/RB though/IN we/PRP were/VBD the/DT last/JJ to/TO leave/NN that/IN night/NN ./.
Make/NNP reservations/NNS in/IN advance/NN if/IN possible/JJ ./.
The/DT Mussels/NNS were/VBD not/RB bad/JJ although/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO order/NN bread/JJ as/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB come/VB with/IN bread/JJ ./.
The/DT scallops/NNS &/CC bacon/NN appetizer/NN was/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ combination/NN ./.

The/DT Surf/NNP &/CC Turf/NNP lobster/NNP tail/NNP &/CC braised/VBD beef/NN was/VBD my/VBN favorite/JJ entree/NN and/CC a/DT big/JJ portion/NN ./.
The/DT sirloin/NN steak/NN w/carrots/VBZ &/CC cauliflower/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT mashed/JJ potatoes/NNS were/VBD not/RB that/IN flavorful/JJ ./.
Dessert/NNP -/VBD the/DT chocolate/NN mouse/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC the/DT chocolate/NN hazelnut/NN (/IN special/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN )/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG !/.
Must/RB order/RB this/DT if/IN you/PRP get/VBP the/DT chance/NN ./.

Portion/NN sizes/NNS were/VBD enormous/JJ ./.
Smoked/JJ salmon/JJ duo/NN for/IN appetizer/NN was/VBD just/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT main/JJ course/NN ./.
Overall/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS meals/NNS we/PRP had/VBD in/IN Edinburgh/NNP ./.
Wow/NNP ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD Sooooo/NNP good/NNP ./.
Oysters/NNS rib/VBP eye/NN and/CC cheesecake/NN were/VBD all/DT incredible/JJ ./.
The/DT side/NN of/IN mushrooms/NNS were/VBD also/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP great/JJ for/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP ./.
Fantastic/JJ location/NN but/CC very/RB small/JJ on/IN the/DT inside/NN ,/, can/MD be/VB a/DT long/JJ wait/NN ./.
The/DT seafood/NN was/VBD only/RB slightly/RB above/JJ average/NN in/IN freshness/NN and/CC quality/NN ,/, and/CC small/JJ portions/NNS ,/, so/RB had/VBD to/TO knock/NN off/IN one/CD star/NN ./.
So/IN you/PRP get/VB mussels/NNS or/CC you/PRP get/VB steak/NN ./.
We/PRP both/VBP got/VBN the/DT steak/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD our/PRP$ first/JJ day/NN in/IN Edinburgh/NNP and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD recommended/VBN by/IN a/DT friend/NN ./.

A/DT great/JJ place/NN for/IN meat/NN and/CC fish/JJ lovers/NNS like/IN me/PRP -/JJ I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP ./.
Ess/NNP
The/DT other/JJ reviews/NNS are/VBP surprising/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ surprise/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT reviewer/NN is/VBZ surprised/VBN to/TO find/VB that/IN Scotland/NNP ,/, the/DT north/JJ part/NN of/IN Great/NNP Britain/NNP (/VBD a/DT well/RB known/VBN island/NN )/NN ,/, has/VBZ decent/JJ seafood/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ ,/, and/CC more/JJR disturbing/JJ ,/, is/VBZ the/DT complaint/NN that/IN a/DT restaurant/NN with/IN the/DT name/NN ``/`` Mussel/NNP and/CC Steak/NNP Bar/NNP ''/'' has/VBZ a/DT fairly/RB short/JJ menu/NN ./.
One/CD might/MD have/VB thought/VBN ,/, nay/JJ expected/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT menu/NN would/MD be/VB mainly/RB .../: On/IN a/DT positive/JJ note/NN ,/, what/WP I/PRP can/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP provide/VBP first/JJ class/NN food/NN ./.
What/WP they/PRP say/VBP they/PRP do/VBP they/PRP do/VBP well/RB ./.
The/DT steaks/NNS ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN ,/, are/VBP meltingly/RB tender/RB ./.
The/DT chips/NNS (/VBP US/NNS :/: french/JJ fries/NNS )/VBP cooked/VBN in/IN beef/NN dripping/VBG are/VBP crisp/NN and/CC moreish/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ good/JJ value/NN because/IN not/RB a/DT morsel/NN will/MD be/VB left/VBN on/IN the/DT plates/NNS ./.
Stopped/NNP for/IN lunch/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD fantastic/JJ ./.
My/NNP wife/NN had/VBD the/DT mussel/NN special/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD the/DT hot/NN seafood/NN platter/NN ./.
I/PRP watched/VBD them/PRP deliver/VBP a/DT few/JJ of/IN the/DT Tomahawk/NNP specials/NNS and/CC they/PRP looked/VBD incredible/JJ ./.
My/NNP only/RB disappointment/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT hot/NN seafood/NN platter/NN was/VBD mostly/RB mussels/NNS and/CC not/RB very/RB varied/JJ but/CC still/RB well/RB done/VBN ./.
The/DT outside/JJ look/NN of/IN this/DT place/NN does/VBZ not/RB represent/VB the/DT quality/NN inside/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Stumbled/NNP upon/IN this/DT gem/NN ./.
An/DT easy/JJ wLk/NN off/IN the/DT Royal/NNP mile/NN and/CC below/IN the/DT castle/NN ./.
The/DT mussels/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN and/CC the/DT scallops/NNS were/VBD terrific/JJ ./.
The/DT cost/NN was/VBD reasonable/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
Came/NN here/RB with/IN family/NN for/IN dinner/NN on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN ./.
We/PRP booked/VBD in/IN advance/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD n't/RB terribly/RB busy/VB in/IN the/DT end/NN ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ formal/NN and/CC a/DT bit/NN quiet/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN bustling/NN and/CC busy/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD for/IN the/DT red/VBN curry/NN mussels/NNS ,/, as/IN did/VBD my/PRP$ husband/NN -/JJ my/NN parents/NN got/VBD the/DT traditional/JJ with/IN shallots/NNS and/CC cream/NN ./.
The/DT servers/NNS gave/VBD us/PRP the/DT wrong/JJ mussel/NN pots/NNS which/WDT took/VBD us/PRP a/DT while/NN to/TO figure/VB out/RP ,/, as/IN all/PDT the/DT sauce/JJ collected/NN at/IN the/DT bottom/NN and/CC was/VBD n't/RB really/RB coating/VBG the/DT mussels/NNS ,/, so/RB we/PRP honestly/RB could/MD n't/RB tell/VB whose/NN was/VBD whose/JJ initially/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO take/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT huge/JJ portion/NN of/IN mussels/NNS out/IN and/CC put/VBD them/PRP to/TO the/DT side/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP had/VBD space/VBN to/TO use/VB our/PRP$ spoons/NNS to/TO coat/VB the/DT remaining/VBG mussels/NNS in/IN sauce/NN ./.
Once/IN we/PRP managed/VBP that/IN though/NN ,/, the/DT mussels/NNS were/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ./.
The/DT sauces/NNS were/VBD mild/RB ,/, but/CC added/VBD a/DT nice/JJ subtle/NN flavour/NN to/TO the/DT dish/JJ ./.
Sides/NNS were/VBD decent/JJ but/CC basic/JJ -/JJ slightly/NN soggy/NN fries/NNS ,/, steamed/VBD seasonal/JJ vegetables/NNS ,/, nothing/NN terribly/RB exciting/VBG ./.
The/DT price/NN ca/MD n't/RB be/VB beat/VBN though/RB ,/, at/IN £14/CD for/IN an/DT enormous/JJ meal/NN ./.
Not/RB the/DT most/RBS memorable/JJ of/IN meals/NNS ,/, but/CC an/DT enjoyable/JJ one/CD ./.
I/PRP think/VBP a/DT loosening/VBG up/NN of/IN the/DT atmosphere/RB would/MD go/VB a/DT long/JJ way/NN ./.
Very/NNP tasty/NN food/NN ,/, great/JJ beer/NN and/CC really/RB friendly/RB service/NN !/.
!/NN
I/PRP never/VBP fail/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT good/JJ feed/NN at/IN the/DT Mussel/NNP and/CC Steak/NNP Bar/NNP ./.
Pot/NN of/IN mussels/NNS with/IN white/JJ wine/NN and/CC garlic/JJ sauce/NN does/VBZ the/DT job/NN perfectly/RB ./.
The/DT ambience/NN is/VBZ pleasant/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ better/JJR to/TO sit/VB downstairs/NNS as/IN the/DT upstairs/NNS bit/NN feels/VBZ a/DT bit/NN empty/NN and/CC lonely/RB I/PRP think/VBP ./.
