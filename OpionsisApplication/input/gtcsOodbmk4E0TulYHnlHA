After/IN seeing/JJ this/DT place/NN pop/VB up/RP on/IN Yelp/NNP and/CC being/VBG featured/VBN in/IN a/DT newsletter/blog/NN that/IN I/PRP follow/VBP I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB these/DT guys/NNS a/DT try/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP only/RB a/DT 10/CD minute/JJ walk/NN from/IN my/PRP$ house/NN so/IN I/PRP thought/VBP this/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT great/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT new/JJ brunch/NN spot/NN close/NN to/TO home/NN ./.
I/PRP popped/VBD in/IN Saturday/NNP morning/NN with/IN my/PRP$ girlfriend/NN only/RB to/TO find/VB out/RP that/IN they/PRP 're/VBP doing/VBG brunch/NN on/IN Sundays/NNP only/RB at/IN the/DT moment/NN ./.
No/DT matter/NN ,/, I/PRP grabbed/VBD a/DT tea/NN to/TO go/VB ,/, of/IN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD 4/VBN choices/NNS of/IN loose/JJ leaf/NN varieties/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.

No/DT open/JJ Wifi/NNP networks/NNS popped/VBD up/RP during/IN my/NN visit/NN so/RB this/DT may/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT place/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN to/TO hang/VB out/RP if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP trying/VBG to/TO get/VB work/NN done/being/VBG a/DT laptop/NN hobo/NN ./.

Actually/RB when/WRB you/PRP do/VBP split/RB bills/VB its/PRP$ so/NN nice/NN and/CC easy/NN for/IN the/DT customer/NN and/CC we/PRP love/VB it/PRP !/-NONE- !/.
For/IN now/RB I/PRP 'll/MD continue/VB to/TO avoid/VB this/DT place/NN at/IN all/DT costs/NNS ./.
Richard/NNP P/NNP 's/POS private/JJ messages/NNS to/TO me/PRP explicitly/RB told/VBD me/PRP that/IN they/PRP do/VBP NOT/NNP do/VB separate/JJ bills/NNS ./.
They/PRP do/VBP allow/RB you/PRP to/TO try/VB and/CC calculate/VB what/WP you/PRP owe/VBP on/IN the/DT one/CD bill/NN that/IN you/PRP receive/VBP ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ NOT/NNP a/DT separate/JJ bill/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB ''/'' justified/VBD ''/'' to/TO me/PRP in/IN previous/JJ messages/NNS why/VBP northwood/NN does/VBZ n't/RB do/VB separate/JJ bills/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ what/WP his/PRP$ comment/NN to/TO my/PRP$ review/NN even/RB means/VBZ ./.

I/PRP came/VBD to/TO Northwood/NNP for/IN birthday/NN drinks/NNS and/CC left/VBN not/RB at/IN all/DT disappointed/JJ --/: which/WDT was/VBD a/DT feat/NN considering/NN that/IN the/DT running/VBG theme/NN of/IN my/PRP$ birthday/NN for/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS is/VBZ disappointment/NN ./.
Northwood/NNP is/VBZ the/DT type/NN of/IN place/NN that/IN feels/NNS like/IN it/PRP fell/VBD right/RB out/IN of/IN my/PRP$ dreams/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP would/MD definitely/RB go/VB into/IN the/DT regular/JJ rotation/NN if/IN I/PRP was/VBD local/JJ ./.
Perfectly/RB friendly/RB and/CC non-intrusive/JJ service/NN ,/, makes/VBZ a/DT mean/JJ cocktail/NN ,/, serves/VBZ coffee/NN ,/, and/CC open/JJ til/NN 2:00/CD am/NN ?/.

The/DT time/NN of/IN year/NN plus/NNS inclement/NN weather/RB meant/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB busy/JJ when/WRB I/PRP visited/VBD ,/, which/WDT made/VBD the/DT atmosphere/RB all/DT the/DT better/NNS for/IN lingering/NN over/IN perfectly/RB balanced/VBN cocktails/NNS ./.
I/PRP selected/VBD the/DT Pretty/NNP Vengeance/NNP for/IN quaffing/JJ ,/, and/CC enjoyed/VBD it/PRP so/RB much/RB that/IN I/PRP promptly/RB ordered/VBD a/DT second/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP could/MD have/VB torn/VBN myself/NN away/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB ordered/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT other/JJ delicious-sounding/JJ offerings/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT time/NN and/CC a/DT place/NN to/TO stick/NN with/IN the/DT tried/NN and/CC true/JJ (/IN the/DT time/NN is/VBZ your/JJ birthday/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT place/NN is/VBZ Northwood/NNP )/NNP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB understand/VB places/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB provide/VB sufficient/JJ plugs/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ customers/NNS --/: many/JJ of/IN whom/NNS are/VBP graduate/JJ students/NNS or/CC young/JJ professionals/NNS --/: ,/, because/IN it/PRP means/VBZ that/IN people/NNS who/WP would/MD become/VB regulars/NNS --/: and/CC spend/VB more/RBR money/NN --/: simply/RB do/VBP n't/RB ./.
I/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT regular/JJ at/IN another/DT café/NN nearby/NN ,/, but/CC since/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB many/JJ plugs/NNS --/: it/PRP was/VBD somewhat/JJ like/IN Lord/NNP the/DT Flies/NNPS in/IN there/NNP --/: I/PRP have/VBP opted/VBN to/TO go/VB to/TO Northwood/NNP instead/NNP ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP free/JJ and/CC fast/JJ wifi/NN ./.
My/NNP new/JJ favorite/JJ place/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ main/JJ haunts/NNS on/IN Bloor/NNP West/NNP ./.

If/IN you/PRP ever/RB entered/VBD Regal/NNP Gardens/NNP ,/, the/DT Chinese/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT pre-dated/JJ Northwood/NNP ,/, the/DT interior/NN is/VBZ not/RB even/RB recognizable/JJ in/IN a/DT wonderful/JJ way/NN ./.

The/DT east/JJ wall/NN is/VBZ now/RB exposed/VBN brick/NN ,/, a/DT long/JJ bar/NN on/IN the/DT west/JJS side/NN featuring/VBG an/DT eclectic/JJ cage/NN holding/VBG all/PDT the/DT liquor/NN ,/, a/DT chalk/NN board/NN menu/NN of/IN preferred/VBN uppers/NNS and/CC downers/NNS and/CC a/DT mish/JJ mash/NN of/IN old/JJ schoolhouse/NN chairs/NNS ,/, wicker/NN bar/NN stools/NNS ,/, wooden/JJ benches/NNS and/CC sturdy/JJ retro/NN pub/NN chairs/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBN that/IN nostalgic/JJ dive/JJ bar/NN feel/NN without/IN the/DT actual/JJ griminess/NN or/CC smell/NN ,/, maybe/NN because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ only/RB seen/VBN one/CD night/NN of/IN patrons/NNS so/RB far/RB but/CC I/PRP appreciate/RB this/DT ./.

Been/NNP here/VBD a/DT few/JJ times/NNS and/CC despite/IN trying/VBG other/JJ places/NNS we/PRP end/VBD up/RP wanting/VBG to/TO come/VB back/RB !/.

It/PRP went/VBD down/IN very/RB smooth/NN ./.
That/DT can/MD be/VB dangerous/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./.
Anyways/NNS ,/, the/DT assortment/NN of/IN drinks/NNS is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ and/CC is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT good/JJ bar/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO imagine/NN this/DT placed/NN once/RB house/VBD a/DT chinese/NN restaurant/NN selling/VBG shit/NN on/IN a/DT tray/NN ./.
The/DT owners/NNS of/IN Northwood/NNP have/VBP transformed/VBN it/PRP into/IN a/DT cafe-cocktail/JJ lounge/NN ,/, doing/VBG random/NN pop/VB up/RP dinners/NNS every/DT so/RB often/RB ,/, and/CC real/JJ cocktails/NNS at/IN night/NN ./.

Just/NNP go/VBD to/TO Northwood/NNP ,/, it/PRP speaks/VBZ for/IN itself/PRP ./.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN here/RB a/DT number/NN of/IN times/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT first/JJ time/NN was/VBD a/DT spontaneous/JJ choice/NN as/IN my/JJ boyfriend/NN had/VBD just/RB heard/VBN that/IN a/DT bar/NN opened/VBD up/RP around/IN the/DT corner/NN from/IN our/PRP$ apartments/NNS ./.
So/IN I/PRP went/VBD ,/, and/CC we/PRP brought/VBP along/IN his/PRP$ out/NN of/IN town/NN friends/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ fantastic/JJ ,/, not/RB exactly/RB a/DT sea/NN storm/NN of/IN young/JJ and/CC beautiful/JJ and/CC young/JJ and/CC restless/JJ youths/NNS doll/VBP 'd/RB up/RB to/TO indulge/NN in/IN the/DT consumption/NN of/IN sweet/JJ sweet/JJ liquid/NN luck/NN that/WDT will/MD hopefully/RB lead/VB them/PRP to/TO sweet/VB sweet/JJ bedroom/NN luck/NN ./.
Not/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD not/RB achieve/VB that/IN ,/, I/PRP mean/RB ,/, their/PRP$ beer/NN menu/NN has/VBZ the/DT most/RBS amazing/JJ selection/NN ranging/VBG from/IN local/JJ blends/NNS ,/, to/TO Deu/NNP du/NNP Ciel/NNP ,/, Cheval/NNP Blanc/NNP ,/, and/CC Beau/NNP 's/POS (/NN a/DT personal/JJ preference/NN )/NN !/.

Once/NNP ,/, Brandan/NNP Canning/NNP was/VBD there/RB spinning/JJ ,/, along/JJ with/IN a/DT chef/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP could/MD not/RB go/VB ./.
Like/IN their/PRP$ facebook/NN page/NN because/IN they/PRP will/MD update/VB you/PRP on/IN sweet/JJ events/NNS ,/, and/CC specialty/NN beers/NNS being/VBG added/NN !/.
Also/RB ,/, a/DT perk/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP open/JJ daily/JJ from/IN 10am/CD to/TO 2am/CD !/.

Stopped/NNP in/IN for/IN a/DT quiet/JJ Sunday/NNP night/NN ./.
Staff/NNP was/VBD kind/JJ and/CC prompt/NN ./.
The/DT toddy/NN warmed/VBD us/PRP up/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT wine/NN was/VBD lovely/RB ./.
The/DT lighting/NN really/RB made/VBD the/DT place/NN feel/NN intimate/NN and/CC almost/RB secret/JJ like/IN a/DT speak/NN easy/NN ./.
Northoods/NNP brings/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ bar/NN to/TO an/DT area/NN of/IN Toronto/NNP that/IN has/VBZ somehow/RB been/VBN devoid/JJ of/IN good/JJ bars/NNS ,/, although/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT awesome/JJ place/NN if/IN you/PRP like/VBP kimchi/NN and/CC soon/RB tofu/NN ./.
The/DT DRINKS/NN :/: --/: BEER/NN :/: They/PRP have/VBP a/DT pretty/RB extensive/JJ bottle/NN list/NN ,/, all/DT at/IN rather/RB high/JJ mark-ups/NNS ,/, 3-4/CD times/NNS LCBO/JJ prices/NNS ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT decent/JJ but/CC not/RB amazing/VBG draft/NN list/NN ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN focus/NN on/IN Beau/NNP 's/POS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT weaker/NN Ontario/NNP breweries/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD astonished/VBN to/TO drink/VB a/DT tasty/NN ,/, but/CC standard-production/NN Beau/NNP 's/POS for/IN $/$ 9.50/pint/CD ./.
Woah/NNP ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ crazy-town/JJ pricing/NN ./.

--/: COCKTAILS/NN :/: They/PRP have/VBP a/DT good/JJ cocktail/NN list/NN and/CC apparently/RB a/DT pretty/RB diverse/JJ set/NN of/IN ingredients/NNS ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Vieux/NNP Carre/NNP ,/, a/DT cocktail/NN I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN looking/VBG for/IN here/RB for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP unfortunately/RB was/VBD underwhelming/VBG ./.
The/DT flavors/NNS were/VBD off/RB ,/, fairly/RB watered/VBD down/IN .../: I/PRP think/VBP the/DT server/bartender/everything/NN else/NN was/VBD harried/VBN ,/, so/RB I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP spent/VBD some/DT time/NN sitting/VBG in/IN ice/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB think/VBP the/DT vermouth/NN was/VBD low/JJ quality/NN .../: not/RB the/DT nice/JJ richness/NN that/WDT helps/NNS balance/NN this/DT drink/NN of/IN say/VB a/DT carpano/NN antica/NN ./.
This/DT cocktail/NN is/VBZ also/RB made/VBN with/IN 1.5/JJ oz/NN of/IN liquor/NN .../: for/IN a/DT drink/NN with/IN no/DT mixer/NN ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ but/CC one/CD shot/NN (/NN and/CC at/IN $/$ 11/CD )/CD ./.
Maybe/NNP that/NNP 's/POS why/NN they/PRP felt/VBD so/RB compelled/VBN to/TO water/VB it/PRP down/IN to/TO make/VB it/PRP look/VB presentable/JJ in/IN a/DT glass/NN ./.
The/DT FOOD/NNP :/: Very/NNP limited/NNP menu/NNP !/.
Just/IN a/DT few/JJ sandwiches/NNS .../: did/VBD n't/RB try/VB ./.
The/DT SERVICE/NNP :/: Very/NNP good/JJ when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD available/JJ ./.
When/WRB we/PRP were/VBD there/RB it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB full/JJ and/CC it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN one/CD guy/NN was/VBD doing/VBG all/PDT the/DT waitering/NN ,/, cocktail/NN making/NN ,/, and/CC beer/NN pouring/VBG ./.
He/PRP was/VBD super/NN friendly/RB and/CC knowledgeable/JJ when/WRB you/PRP had/VBD his/PRP$ attention/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP mostly/RB did/VBD n't/RB have/VB attention/VBN ./.
On/IN the/DT whole/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN is/VBZ too/RB expensive/JJ for/IN what/WP 's/POS on/IN offer/NN ./.
Not/RB going/VBG to/TO rush/JJ back/NNS ./.
Walked/NNP in/IN to/TO this/DT bar/NN by/IN chance/NN and/CC was/VBD thoroughly/RB impressed/VBN ./.
Emily/NNP was/VBD a/DT charming/NN host/NN and/CC made/VBD me/PRP feel/VBP like/IN this/DT was/VBD my/JJ local/JJ pub/NN ./.
The/DT cocktails/NNS were/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC proportioned/VBD to/TO maximize/VB strength/NN without/IN compromising/NN taste/NN ./.
10/10/CD would/MD try/VB again/RB ./.
Came/NN here/RB on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN after/IN dinner/NN in/IN ktown/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD just/RB a/DT short/JJ walk/NN away/RB ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD fairly/RB packed/VBN around/IN 9pm/CD and/CC we/PRP got/VBD a/DT seats/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, the/DT atmosphere/NN was/VBD great/JJ !/.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT their/PRP$ cocktail/NN special/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT ``/`` punch/NN ''/'' with/IN rum/NN and/CC spices/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ !/.
They/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT good/JJ beer/NN selection/NN and/CC drinks/NNS were/VBD reasonably/RB prices/NNS ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ small/JJ so/IN the/DT waitress/NN would/MD bump/VB into/IN me/PRP sometimes/RB walking/VBG from/IN the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO the/DT tables/NNS and/CC there/NNS were/VBD limited/VBN number/NN of/IN hooks/NNS for/IN your/PRP$ bag/NN and/CC coat/NN but/CC will/MD definitely/RB be/VB coming/VBG back/RB for/IN drinks/NNS and/CC checking/VBG out/RP other/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN !/.
Coffee/NN was/VBD fine/JJ but/CC waiters/NNS are/VBP slow/JJ and/CC kind/NN of/IN too/RB cool/NN for/IN school/NN ./.
Nice/NNP decor/NN and/CC selection/NN though/IN ./.
Cute/NNP and/CC cozy/JJ spot/NN for/IN beer/NN ,/, especially/RB during/IN the/DT daily/JJ (/NN !/NN )/.

One/CD day/NN when/WRB my/JJ beer/NN bud/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD exploring/VBG that/IN end/NN of/IN Bloor/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP saw/VBD the/DT sandwich/JJ board/NN advertising/NN $/$ 2/CD off/CD any/DT beer/NN between/IN 5/NNS and/CC 7/CD ./.
I/PRP made/VBD a/DT mental/JJ note/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO come/VB back/RB ./.
We/PRP 're/VBP glad/JJ we/PRP did/VBD -/JJ we/PRP love/VB the/DT vibe/NN ,/, the/DT decor/NN ,/, the/DT service/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT local/JJ for/IN us/PRP ,/, but/CC we/PRP make/VBP a/DT point/NN of/IN coming/VBG in/IN for/IN a/DT pint/NN when/WRB the/DT location/NN and/CC timing/VBG works/NNS out/IN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ place/NN we/PRP tried/VBD Kissmeyer/NNP on/IN tap/NN ./.
A/DT tad/NN pricey/NN during/IN regular/JJ hours/NNS (/IN we/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN it/PRP for/IN significantly/RB less/JJR )/NN ,/, but/CC nice/RB at/IN $/$ 6.75/CD (/CD before/IN tip/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN does/VBZ fill/NN up/RB from/IN 5/CD to/TO 7/CD ,/, so/RB be/VB warned/VBN you/PRP might/MD not/RB find/VB a/DT table/JJ if/IN you/PRP arrive/VBP too/RB late/JJ or/CC come/VB with/IN too/RB many/JJ people/NNS ./.
Some/DT folks/NNS make/VBP this/DT their/NN coffee/NN and/CC laptop/NN spot/NN during/IN the/DT late/JJ afternoons/NNS and/CC this/DT spills/NNS over/IN into/IN happy/JJ hour/NNS ./.
A/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS are/VBP here/RB for/IN the/DT cocktails/NNS ,/, not/RB the/DT beer/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ fun/JJ to/TO sit/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN and/CC watch/VB the/DT concoctioneering/NN ./.
Another/DT amazing/JJ gem/NN in/IN the/DT neighbourhood/NN -/JJ excellent/JJ coffee/NN shop/NN by/IN day/NN and/CC bar/NN by/IN night/NN ./.

The/DT music/JJ at/IN night/NN is/VBZ just/RB right/RB ./.
A/DT new/JJ favourite/NN ,/, ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO try/VB one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ pop/NN up/IN dinners/NNS or/CC brunch/NN ./.

The/DT cost/NN for/IN booze/NN was/VBD moderately/RB priced/VBN -/NN a/DT bit/NN more/RBR than/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP comfortable/JJ with/IN ,/, so/IN I/PRP usually/VBP stick/JJ to/TO 2/CD cocktails/NNS max/NN ./.
Anything/VBG after/IN that/DT is/VBZ if/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP feeling/VBG splurgy/NN (/NN or/CC want/VB to/TO get/VB drunk/JJ )/NN ./.

I/PRP come/VBP here/RB at/IN least/JJS once/RB a/DT week/NN to/TO catch/NN up/RP with/IN a/DT friend/NN or/CC to/TO write/VB on/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ while/IN sipping/VBG a/DT drink/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ my/JJ favourite/JJ bar/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB live/VB near/IN its/PRP$ neighbourhood/NN ./.
The/DT LADY/NNP GREY/NNP SOUR/NNP cocktail/NN is/VBZ probably/RB their/PRP$ signature/NN drink/NN ,/, is/VBZ excellent/JJ ,/, and/CC is/VBZ exactly/RB as/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ described/NN ./.
But/CC my/PRP$ favourite/NN is/VBZ STORM/NNP BREWING/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT twist/NN on/IN the/DT classic/JJ Dark/NNP &/CC Stormy/NNP with/IN a/DT clever/JJR addition/NN of/IN their/PRP$ in-house/JJ cold/NN brew/NN coffee/NN ./.
This/DT drink/NN is/VBZ definitely/RB not/RB for/IN everyone/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ layered/VBN and/CC unexpected/JJ in/IN all/DT the/DT right/JJ ways/NNS ./.
When/WRB their/PRP$ experienced/JJ bartender/NN (/NN s/VBZ )/RB make/VB it/PRP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ brilliant/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT fairly/RB steady/JJ bartender/NN turnover/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ secondary/JJ bartenders/NNS make/VBP a/DT poor/JJ and/CC disappointing/JJ version/NN (/NN either/IN far/RB too/RB sour/JJ or/CC using/VBG flattened/VBN ginger/JJR beer/NN )/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP really/RB feeling/VBG adventurous/JJ ,/, try/IN the/DT Black/NNP Lodge/NNP cocktail/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN me/PRP the/DT combination/NN of/IN tequila/NN ,/, cold/NN brew/NN ,/, agave/JJ sweetness/NN ,/, and/CC egg/VB white/JJ proteins/NNS is/VBZ all/DT wrong/JJ and/CC totally/RB undrinkable/JJ ./.
They/PRP had/VBD some/DT other/JJ amazing/VBG cocktails/NNS in/IN the/DT winter/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO them/PRP switching/VBG the/DT menu/NN up/IN again/CD ./.
So/RB ,/, if/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB stop/VB coming/VBG to/TO this/DT awesome/NN bar/NN ,/, why/WRB only/RB 4/CD stars/NNS ?/.
First/NN :/: the/DT uneven/JJ drink/NN preparation/NN ./.
I/PRP never/RB thought/VBD much/RB about/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN ``/`` mixology/NN ''/'' until/IN coming/VBG here/RB over/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN 8+/CD months/NNS and/CC noting/VBG the/DT really/NN wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN quality/NN in/IN the/DT drinks/NNS ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT winter/NN ,/, I/PRP used/VBD to/TO order/VB the/DT Vieux/NNP Carre/NNP cocktail/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO balance/NN well/RB and/CC *demands*/RB top-notch/JJ ingredients/NNS ./.
When/WRB one/CD of/IN the/DT owners/NNS (/VBP or/CC whom/VB I/PRP imagine/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT key/JJ bartender/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT least/JJS )/NN makes/VBZ it/PRP ,/, he/PRP takes/VBZ great/JJ care/NN and/CC tries/VBZ the/DT drink/NN ,/, sometimes/RB adjusting/VBG to/TO get/VB it/PRP right/RB ./.
The/DT last/JJ time/NN I/PRP attempted/VBD to/TO order/VB it/PRP ,/, with/IN a/DT different/JJ bartender/NN ,/, it/PRP tasted/VBD way/NN off/NNS and/CC the/DT rye/NN whiskey/NN itself/PRP was/VBD poor/JJ quality/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP mentioned/VBD to/TO the/DT bartender/NN that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB balance/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN always/RB ,/, she/PRP gave/VBD me/PRP a/DT puzzled/VBN expression/NN and/CC said/VBD ``/`` but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ such/JJ an/DT easy/JJ one/CD ,/, I/PRP just/RB poured/VBD whatever/NN it/PRP said/VBD in/IN the/DT recipe/NN ./. ''/''
[/NN easy/VBD one/CD ?/.
it/PRP has/VBZ 6/VBN components/NNS .../: ]/IN I/PRP realize/VBP I/PRP might/MD be/VB more/RBR picky/JJ than/IN most/JJS ,/, but/CC a/DT great/JJ cocktail/NN menu/NN (/NN at/IN great-cocktail/NN prices/NNS ,/, no/DT less/JJR )/NNS deserves/VBZ better/JJR ./.
Second/NNP ,/, the/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ ,/, at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP 're/VBP still/RB trying/VBG to/TO work/VB out/RP their/PRP$ kitchen/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP get/VBP the/DT sense/NN that/IN the/DT owners/NNS '/POS heart/NN is/VBZ n't/RB in/IN the/DT culinary/JJ side/NN as/RB much/JJ as/IN the/DT beverages/NNS ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB come/VB here/RB hungry/JJ and/CC do/VBP n't/RB plan/VB to/TO eat/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT cafe/bar/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ totally/RB amazing/VBG at/IN doing/JJ just/RB that/IN ./.
Oh/NNP boy/NN .../:
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB happy/JJ writing/NN this/DT ./.
Service/NNP here/RB is/VBZ how/WRB I/PRP expect/VBP war/JJ criminals/NNS to/TO be/VB served/VBN in/IN heaven/NN ./.
(/IN Ignored/NNP ,/, awful/JJ )/NN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN here/RB around/IN 20/CD times/NNS and/CC around/IN the/DT last/JJ ten/NN have/VBP been/VBN some/DT of/IN the/DT laziest/JJS instances/NNS of/IN service/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB you/PRP want/VB to/TO come/VB to/TO my/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC take/VB more/RBR drink/JJ orders/NNS ?/. ?/.
Do/NNP n't/RB you/PRP want/VB to/TO make/VB money/NN ?/NN ?/.
Sitting/VBG half/DT an/DT hour/NN without/IN a/DT drink/NN order/NN on/IN a/DT table/JJ and/CC no/DT water/NN glasses/NNS is/VBZ insane/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP embarrassed/VBN to/TO stay/VB I/PRP stayed/VBD ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ never/RB very/RB busy/JJ when/WRB I/PRP come/VBP ./.
And/CC having/VBG to/TO beg/NN for/IN the/DT bill/NN only/RB to/TO see/VB the/DT bartender/NN start/NN cleaning/VBG tables/NNS after/IN saying/VBG ``/`` yes/NNS ''/'' is/VBZ creepy/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ also/RB creepy/NN when/WRB they/PRP only/RB pay/VBP attention/NN to/TO you/PRP when/WRB they/PRP want/VBP your/JJ money/NN ./.
This/DT happens/NNS all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.
Once/IN the/DT bill/NN is/VBZ down/IN they/PRP 're/VBP like/IN vultures/NNS ./.
Good/NNP luck/NN on/IN the/DT patio/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN as/IN you/PRP could/MD be/VB having/VBG a/DT heart/NN attack/NN and/CC none/NN of/IN the/DT staff/NN would/MD notice/RB ./.
They/PRP would/MD probably/RB start/VB cleaning/JJ tables/NNS around/IN your/PRP$ dying/NN body/NN ./.
Really/RB wished/VBD this/DT place/NN was/VBD around/IN when/WRB I/PRP worked/VBP in/IN the/DT Bloor/NNP &/CC Shaw/NNP area/NNP ./.
The/DT last/JJ time/NN I/PRP walked/VBD by/IN this/DT location/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT questionable/JJ Chinese/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC notice/VB there/EX 's/VBZ something/NN much/RB better/JJR going/NN on/IN when/WRB I/PRP strolled/VBD by/IN the/DT other/JJ day/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD sense/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT coffee/NN shop/NN when/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD in/IN based/NN on/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN people/NNS clicking/VBG away/RB on/IN their/PRP$ laptops/NNS ./.
I/PRP figured/VBD I/PRP would/MD rest/VB my/PRP$ feet/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN and/CC have/VBP my/VBN fourth/JJ cup/NN of/IN coffee/NN that/IN day/NN ./.
I/PRP looked/VBD around/IN to/TO see/VB if/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT menu/NN and/CC grabbed/VBN their/PRP$ clipboard/NN --/: it/PRP listed/RB all/PDT the/DT fancy/NN coffees/VBZ they/PRP make/VBP ,/, but/CC thankfully/RB they/PRP had/VBD three/CD edible/JJ options/NNS at/IN the/DT bottom/NN ./.
I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT ham/NNP &/CC swiss/NNP sandwich/NN ./.
Americano/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Girl/NNP working/NNP there/NNP was/VBD friendly/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT decor/NN was/VBD quite/JJ nice/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT unique/JJ experience/NN with/IN lots/NNS of/IN wood/NNP &/CC black/NNP paint/NNP (/NNP similar/JJ to/TO Beaconsfield/NNP or/CC Churchill/NNP )/NNP but/CC I/PRP appreciated/VBD the/DT effort/NN in/IN making/VBG the/DT place/NN comfortable/JJ ./.
Quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN time/NN passed/IN since/IN I/PRP finished/VBP my/JJ drink/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD wondering/VBG if/IN my/PRP$ sandwich/NN was/VBD coming/VBG or/CC not/RB ./.
I/PRP was/VBD actually/RB about/IN to/TO pack/VB up/RP and/CC forget/NN about/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC then/RB a/DT dude/NN finally/RB came/VBD with/IN what/WP turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT rather/RB delicious/JJ hot/NN snack/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP not/RB worth/VBD the/DT six-plus/JJ dollars/NNS it/PRP cost/-NONE- (/RB though/IN it/PRP came/VBD with/IN grapefruit/NN which/WDT I/PRP skipped/VBD )/JJ but/CC I/PRP was/VBD still/RB satisfied/VBN ./.
Would/NNP really/VBD like/IN to/TO see/VB some/DT more/JJR snacks/NNS ./.
Even/RB maybe/RB just/RB some/DT baked/JJ goods/NNS like/IN muffins/NNS or/CC cookies/NNS ./.
I/PRP realise/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ also/RB probably/RB a/DT rocking/NN bar/NN at/IN night/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ going/VBG to/TO do/VB the/DT coffee/NN shop/NN vibe/NN in/IN the/DT morning/afternoon/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT little/RB more/RBR variety/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD have/VB killed/VBN for/IN some/DT soup/NN ./.
I/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN here/NN with/IN a/DT friend/NN for/IN a/DT drink/NN in/IN between/IN other/JJ stops/NNS on/IN our/PRP$ route/NN on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ./.
Obviously/RB with/IN such/JJ great/JJ reviews/NNS ,/, we/PRP were/VBD looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO coming/VBG to/TO Northwood/NNP ./.
We/PRP walked/VBD in/IN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB dark/JJ inside/NN ./.
No/DT problem/NN though/IN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD nighttime/JJ and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT bar/NN so/IN the/DT lighting/NN was/VBD acceptable/JJ ./.
Actually/RB ,/, this/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT GREAT/NNP place/NN to/TO bring/VB someone/NN when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP either/DT not/RB looking/VBG so/RB hot/NN or/CC the/DT person/NN you/PRP 're/VBP with/IN is/VBZ n't/RB looking/VBG so/RB hot/NN !/.
Anyway/NNP .../:
The/DT place/NN was/VBD full/JJ when/WRB we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN ./.
All/DT tables/NNS and/CC bar/NN stools/NNS were/VBD occupied/VBN but/CC the/DT guy/NN behind/IN the/DT bar/NN motioned/VBD to/TO an/DT empty/NN table/JJ at/IN the/DT back/NN and/CC so/IN we/PRP sat/VBP there/RB ./.
A/DT server/NN came/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ promptly/RB with/IN a/DT menu/NN ./.
When/WRB she/PRP returned/VBD to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ order/NN ,/, my/PRP$ friend/NN was/VBD in/IN the/DT washroom/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT dubbel/NN (/VBD $/$ 9/CD )/CD (/NN so/RB glad/RB this/DT beer/NN is/VBZ so/RB often/RB on/IN drink/NN menus/NNS now/RB )/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP told/VBD the/DT server/NN that/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN would/MD order/VB when/WRB she/PRP returned/VBD to/TO her/PRP$ seat/NN ./.
Our/NNP server/NN brought/VBD my/PRP$ drink/NN along/NN with/IN a/DT bottle/NN of/IN water/NN and/CC two/CD glasses/NNS ./.
My/NNP friend/NN was/VBD still/RB checking/VBG the/DT menu/NN ./.
The/DT server/NN never/RB returned/VBD .../: NEVER/NNP ./.
I/PRP finished/VBD my/PRP$ beer/NN and/CC she/PRP had/VBD n't/RB even/RB come/VB by/IN again/RB ONCE/NNP !/.
We/PRP decided/VBD that/IN since/IN the/DT service/NN sucked/VBD we/PRP 'd/MD be/VB on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN ./.
I/PRP put/VBD $/$ 12/CD (/CD a/DT 10/CD and/CC a/DT twoonie/JJ )/NN on/IN the/DT table/JJ to/TO cover/VB my/PRP$ beer+tax+tip/NN ./.
After/IN we/PRP were/VBD walking/VBG down/IN the/DT street/NN ,/, my/PRP$ friend/NN handed/VBD me/PRP the/DT twoonie/NN I/PRP had/VBD left/VBN ./.
She/PRP said/VBD she/PRP took/VBD it/PRP because/IN the/DT server/NN did/VBD n't/RB deserve/VB it/PRP ./.
I/PRP actually/RB felt/VBD pretty/RB bad/JJ because/IN that/IN meant/JJ I/PRP was/VBD actually/RB 17/CD cents/NNS short/RB on/IN the/DT actual/JJ bill/NN with/IN tax/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD then/RB a/DT little/JJ embarrassed/VBN that/IN I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP being/VBG short/JJ ,/, but/CC whatever/JJR ./.
Anyway/NNP ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ this/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ with/IN a/DT different/JJ server/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP totally/RB come/VBN back/RB ,/, pay/NN my/NN amount/NN owing/VBG from/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN and/CC leave/VBD an/DT appropriate/NN tip/NN on/IN whatever/NN I/PRP had/VBD during/IN my/PRP$ return/NN ./.
(/IN I/PRP just/RB would/MD n't/RB bring/VB a/DT friend/NN who/WP might/MD reclaim/VB my/PRP$ tip/NN money/NN !/NN )/.
Even/RB though/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD busy/NN ,/, the/DT crowd/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ tame/NN ./.
Everyone/NNP was/VBD seated/VBN so/RB my/JJ first/JJ impression/NN was/VBD that/IN this/DT is/VBZ more/JJR of/IN a/DT date/NN place/NN ./.
(/IN Actually/RB ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN ambiance/NN ,/, it/PRP reminded/VBD me/PRP a/DT bit/NN of/IN Bar/NNP Volo/NNP )/NNP ./.
So/IN yeah/JJ ,/, the/DT poor/JJ rating/NN is/VBZ really/RB just/RB based/VBN on/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD as/IN I/PRP mentioned/VBD :/: non-existent/JJ ./.
That/DT said/VBD ,/, I/PRP totally/RB want/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
And/CC if/IN anyone/NN from/IN Northwood/NNP is/VBZ reading/RB this/DT .../NN
I/PRP 'm/VBP seriously/RB really/RB sorry/JJ about/IN being/VBG 17-cents/NNS short/JJ !/.
(/NN Not/VBD so/RB sorry/JJ my/NN friend/NN scammed/VBD the/DT tip/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB really/RB deserved/VBN anyway/NN )/NN ./.
Thanks/NNS to/TO my/VB DT-TO/JJ partner/NN in/IN crime/NN Evelyn/NNP W/NNP for/IN bringing/JJ me/NN to/TO her/PRP secret/VB happy/NN place/NN where/WRB good/JJ things/NNS come/VBP in/IN a/DT cup/JJ all/DT day/NN long/RB ./.
She/PRP invited/VBD me/PRP here/RB on/IN a/DT GTA/TO/NNP work/NN day/NN and/CC said/VBD this/DT was/VBD the/DT place/NN to/TO be/VB for/IN Coffee/NN ,/, Cocktails/NNS and/CC WiFi/NNP ./.
I/PRP arrived/VBD a/DT tad/JJ early/NN and/CC got/VBD a/DT chance/NN to/TO scope/VB out/RP the/DT joint/NN for/IN myself/NN and/CC was/VBD really/RB impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT caged/JJ in/IN bar/NN ,/, uber/JJR clean/JJ basement/NN bathrooms/NNS and/CC the/DT espresso/NN machines/VBZ spoutin/NN '/POS steam/NN ready/NN to/TO whip/VB up/RP my/PRP$ order/NN ./.
Even/RB got/VBD a/DT few/JJ moments/NNS alone/RB with/IN the/DT morning/NN barista/NN before/IN the/DT crowds/NNS flocked/VBD in/IN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD very/RB knowledgeable/JJ about/IN her/PRP bean/JJ and/CC made/VBD me/PRP a/DT stellar/JJ Americano/NN that/WDT kept/IN the/DT fire/NN going/VBG most/NN of/IN the/DT morning/NN !/.
After/IN taking/VBG a/DT brief/JJ break/NN for/IN lunch/NN ,/, we/PRP returned/VBP and/CC I/PRP sat/VBP with/IN a/DT great/JJ cup/NN of/IN tea/NN while/IN I/PRP did/VBD my/VB afternoon/NN work/NN ./.
Upon/NNP our/VBD afternoon/NN return/NN Northwood/NNP was/VBD bustling/VBG with/IN would/MD be/VB bloggers/NNS ,/, next-gen/JJ work/NN from/IN hom-ers/NNS and/CC various/JJ other/JJ Apple/NN computer/NN users/NNS ./.
One/CD item/NN of/IN note/NN that/IN as/IN the/DT body/NN count/NN rises/NNS in/IN here/RB ,/, so/RB to/TO does/VB the/DT temperature/NN and/CC before/IN long/JJ I/PRP was/VBD stripped/JJ down/IN to/TO my/PRP$ undershirt/NN and/CC jeans/NNS ./.
So/RB ensure/RB you/PRP layer/JJR even/RB in/IN the/DT dead/NN of/IN winter/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT preceding/VBG Americano/NNP and/CC Tea/NNP were/VBD essential/JJ parts/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ functioning/JJ day/NN ,/, the/DT part/NN I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT most/RBS was/VBD my/JJ end/NN of/IN day/NN cocktail/NN ./.
A/DT real/JJ treat/NN lay/NN in/IN store/NN for/IN me/PRP as/IN I/PRP let/VBP the/DT staff/NN choose/NN my/NN poison/NN for/IN me/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD blessed/VBN to/TO be/VB granted/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO sip/VB on/IN their/PRP$ Smoked/JJ Old/NNP Fashioned/NNP done/NNP with/IN maple/JJ syrup/NN .../:

All/DT that/NN came/VBD to/TO me/PRP whilst/VB sippin/JJ '/NNS on/IN this/DT sweet-n-smokey/JJ delight/NN !/.
Would/NNP move/NN to/TO the/DT neighborhood/NN just/RB to/TO visit/NN Northwood/NNP more/RBR often/RB ./.
The/DT experience/NN at/IN Northwood/NNP is/VBZ special/JJ ,/, from/IN the/DT music/JJ to/TO the/DT staff/NN and/CC (/NN most/RBS importantly/RB )/IN the/DT drinks/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT perfect/NN spot/NN for/IN date/NN night/NN drinks/NNS ,/, or/CC catching/VBG up/RP with/IN a/DT small/JJ group/NN of/IN friends/NNS ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB think/VB of/IN anywhere/RB else/RB in/IN Toronto/NNP that/IN you/PRP get/VBP 2-2.5/JJ oz/NN cocktails/NNS for/IN such/JJ reasonable/JJ prices/NNS (/VBD $/$ 11-14/CD for/IN most/JJS )/JJ ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS drinks/NNS you/PRP 'll/MD have/VB in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP went/VBD recently/RB and/CC each/DT had/VBD 3/VBN cocktails/NNS ,/, each/DT better/JJR than/IN the/DT last/JJ ./.
Our/NNP favorites/NNS were/VBD La/VBN Commune/NNP and/CC Black/NNP Walnut/NNP ./.
The/DT bartender/NN we/PRP had/VBD last/JJ time/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ ./.
She/PRP managed/VBD to/TO get/VB cocktails/NNS out/IN to/TO 30/CD people/NNS quickly/RB ,/, was/VBD able/JJ to/TO answer/VB questions/NNS about/IN the/DT drinks/NNS ,/, and/CC was/VBD really/RB friendly/RB ./.

I/PRP love/VBP the/DT atmosphere/NN and/CC the/DT server/NN was/VBD so/RB friendly/RB and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
I/PRP got/VBD a/DT brownie/NN with/IN caramel/NN and/CC salt/VB it/PRP was/VBD sooo/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT tea/NN they/PRP serve/VBP is/VBZ from/IN tealish/JJ so/IN it/PRP was/VBD also/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP love/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT coffee/NN shop/NN and/CC a/DT bar/NN and/CC stays/NNS open/JJ until/IN 2am/CD !/NNS !/.
I/PRP mean/VBP really/RB what/WP more/RBR could/MD you/VB ask/NN for/IN ./.
It/PRP really/RB has/VBZ it/PRP all/DT ./.
The/DT only/JJ issue/NN I/PRP would/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT chairs/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB backs/NNS to/TO them/PRP which/WDT can/MD be/VB annoying/VBG if/IN you/PRP go/VBP to/TO do/VB work/NN ./.
They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP some/DT chairs/NNS with/IN backs/NNS but/CC just/RB be/VB aware/JJ !/.
I/PRP love/VBP sitting/VBG here/RB in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN to/TO work/NN ./.

I/PRP spent/VBD the/DT better/JJR part/NN of/IN a/DT day/NN at/IN Northwood/NNP and/CC enjoyed/VBD it/PRP so/RB much/JJ I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB even/RB tired/VBN of/IN being/VBG there/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN it/PRP all/DT ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ great/JJ for/IN working/NN during/IN the/DT day/NN and/CC socializing/NN during/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.
Seriously/RB ,/, this/DT cafe/NN covers/VBZ it/PRP all/DT ./.
An/DT added/VBD bonus/NN of/IN being/VBG there/RB so/RB long/RB means/VBZ that/IN I/PRP experienced/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN what/WP they/PRP have/VBP to/TO offer/NN ,/, and/CC from/IN lattes/NNS to/TO sparkling/VBG wine/NN at/IN happy/JJ hour/NN ,/, to/TO cheese/VB plates/NNS ,/, everything/NN I/PRP had/VBD I/PRP liked/VBD ./.
The/DT menus/NNS are/VBP small/JJ ,/, but/CC creative/JJ and/CC the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ efficiently/RB friendly/RB ./.
It/PRP would/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ main/JJ hangs/NNS if/IN I/PRP lived/VBD in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
Nice/NNP little/VBD bar/NN with/IN atmoshere/RB and/CC good/JJ selection/NN of/IN drinks/NNS ,/, including/VBG some/DT beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN ./.
Little/NNP because/IN seating/NN might/MD be/VB limited/VBN ,/, but/CC patio/NN in/IN summer/JJ time/NN is/VBZ rather/RB large/JJ ./.

I/PRP like/VBP how/WRB dimly/JJ lit/NN it/PRP it/PRP ./.
The/DT cocktails/NNS and/CC beer/NN selection/NN are/VBP awesome/JJ ,/, though/IN I/PRP will/MD say/VB slightly/RB overpriced/VBN (/NN hence/NN the/DT 4/NN stars/NNS )/NN ./.
Overall/IN a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO hang/NN ,/, whether/IN stopping/NN in/IN for/IN a/DT casual/JJ drink/NN or/CC going/VBG on/IN a/DT date/NN ./.
Northwood/NNP is/VBZ a/DT gem/NN ./.

Plus/RB ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP serves/VBZ tasty/JJ coffee/NN and/CC snacks/VBZ during/IN the/DT day/NN is/VBZ just/RB great/JJ ./.
Only/RB disappointments/VBZ :/: it/PRP tends/VBZ to/TO get/VB packed/VBN with/IN hipsters/NNS later/JJ in/IN the/DT night/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT NYE/NNP dinner/NN was/VBD overpriced/VBN and/CC not/RB at/IN all/DT memorable/JJ ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN really/RB depends/VBZ on/IN who/WP 's/POS cooking/catering/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT staff/NN seem/VBP much/JJ more/JJR used/NN to/TO bar/NN tending/VBG than/IN serving/VBG tables/NNS ./.
But/CC all/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP really/RB like/IN this/DT place/NN !/.

Had/NNP a/DT small/JJ birthday/NN gathering/NN here/RB and/CC had/VBD no/DT issues/NNS by/IN calling/VBG a/DT week/NN in/IN advance/NNP !/.
Nice/NNP little/VBD bar/NN in/IN the/DT Bloor/Ossington/NNP 'hood/NNP ./.

I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP a/DT tad/JJ overpriced/VBN ./.
I/PRP find/VBP myself/JJ only/RB ever/RB going/VBG between/IN 5-7/CD when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ $/$ 2/CD off/CD draught/NN ./.
Went/NNP here/RB for/IN brunch/NN yesterday/NN ./.
Bavette/NNP steak/NN was/VBD satisfying/JJ ,/, and/CC precisely/RB medium-rare/JJ ,/, as/IN requested/VBN ./.
Veal/NNP poutine/NN had/VBD ``/`` home/NN fries/NNS ''/'' -style/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN potato/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN (/NN long/RB ,/, thin/JJ )/NN french/NN fries/NNS (/VBP which/WDT was/VBD not/RB explicit/VB on/IN the/DT menu/NN )/NN ./.
This/DT cuts/VBZ down/RB on/IN the/DT surface/NN area/NN and/CC is/VBZ sub-optimal/JJ for/IN poutine/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB did/VBD not/RB have/VB quite/JJ enough/JJ cheese/NN ,/, nor/CC quite/RB enough/RB gravy/JJ ./.
The/DT veal/NN itself/NN was/VBD moist/JJ and/CC tender/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, for/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN ,/, redeemed/VBD the/DT dish/JJ ./.
Pork/NNP and/CC beef/NNP tourtiere/NN was/VBD great/JJ (/NN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP into/IN that/DT sort/NN of/IN thing/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT pastry/NN was/VBD crisp/NN and/CC flaky/NN ,/, the/DT interior/NN was/VBD lightly/RB spiced/VBN ,/, saucy/JJ ,/, and/CC flavorful/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN apple/NN sauce/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN which/WDT provided/-NONE- some/DT great/JJ complimentary/NN sweetness/NN and/CC tartness/NN ./.
Stack-o-flapjacks/NNP was/VBD a/DT gratifying/JJ way/NN to/TO spike/VB my/PRP$ blood/NN sugar/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT bourbon/NN maple/NN syrup/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ touch/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD quite/JJ impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT variety/NN of/IN cocktails/NNS Northwood/NNP had/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN ./.

Definitely/RB a/DT drink/NN only/RB for/IN those/DT that/IN like/IN hard/JJ liquor/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ that/IN the/DT bartender/NN was/VBD nice/JJ enough/JJ to/TO describe/VB the/DT differences/NNS and/CC particulars/NNS about/IN each/DT drink/NN as/IN I/PRP doubt/VBP any/DT first/JJ timers/NNS like/IN myself/NN would/MD know/VB which/WDT cocktail/NN to/TO best/VB order/NN ./.

I/PRP did/VBD enjoy/VB the/DT environment/NN and/CC set-up/JJ but/CC menu/NN was/VBD disappointing/JJ ./.
For/IN an/DT appetizer/NN I/PRP did/VBD order/NN hummus/NNS and/CC what/WP I/PRP got/VBD in/IN return/NN was/VBD a/DT few/JJ dozen/NN seasoned/VBN garbanzo/NN beans/NNS ./.

So/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ update/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ off/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP stopped/VBN with/IN the/DT oysters/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT patio/NN is/VBZ n't/RB in/IN full/JJ swing/NN ,/, but/CC .../:

I/PRP came/VBD twice/JJ here/NN and/CC both/DT times/NNS was/VBD turned/VBN away/RB because/IN they/PRP were/VBD at/IN capacity/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP left/VBD my/JJ number/NN and/CC was/VBD texted/VBN back/RB 1.5/JJ hours/NNS later/JJ ./.
It/PRP seems/VBZ unbelievable/JJ that/IN the/DT next/JJ available/JJ seat/NN needed/VBD a/DT 1.5/NN hour/NN wait/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN there/EX was/VBD clearly/RB a/DT woman/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN leaving/NN and/CC an/DT empty/NN stool/NN next/JJ to/TO her/PRP but/CC I/PRP still/RB received/VBD the/DT same/JJ response/NN ./.

Maybe/NNP I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB fit/VB the/DT clientele/NN or/CC the/DT host/NN did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO bother/NN serving/VBG me/PRP .../: the/DT drinks/NNS were/VBD good/JJ in/IN the/DT past/NN but/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB care/VB for/IN the/DT host/NN ./.
