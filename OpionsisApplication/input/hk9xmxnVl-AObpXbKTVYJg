The/DT seafood/NN platter/NN was/VBD a/DT good/JJ deal/NN and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN !/.
Let/NNP 's/POS begin/NN with/IN ./.
Place/NNP was/VBD hot/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.
The/DT AC/NNP was/VBD either/VBN not/RB working/VBG or/CC owner/NN was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO save/VB some/DT money/NN ./.

Not/RB likely/JJ and/CC most/RBS likely/JJ I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB back/RB either/RB ./.
Never/NNP again/RB bad/JJ costumer/NN service/NN and/CC not/RB so/RB good/JJ food/NN ./.
And/CC so/IN expensive/JJ !/.
I/PRP rather/RB make/VBP it/PRP myself/-NONE- or/CC wait/VB till/NN i/NN go/NN to/TO cali/NN
Came/NN here/RB with/IN mom/NN for/IN some/DT dinner/NN after/IN some/DT errands/NNS ./.
Mom/NNP had/VBD a/DT feel/NN for/IN mariscos/NNS so/IN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN ./.
We/PRP arrived/VBD about/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS before/IN closing/NNS and/CC sat/JJ down/NNS ./.
We/PRP were/VBD then/RB told/VBN by/IN the/DT waitress/NN that/IN the/DT kitchen/NN is/VBZ closed/VBN for/IN hot/NN dishes/NNS but/CC they/PRP do/VBP have/VBP cold/VBN dishes/NNS since/IN it/PRP was/VBD near/IN closing/JJ time/NN ./.
Although/IN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD n't/RB nice/JJ about/IN it/PRP at/IN all/DT ./.
Ok/NNP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD understanding/NN of/IN that/DT since/IN we/PRP knew/VBD they/PRP needed/VBD to/TO clean/VB the/DT floor/NN and/CC do/VB anything/NN else/VB before/IN closing/NN ./.
So/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD cocteles/NNS de/IN camarón/NN ./.
Pretty/NNP easy/NNP and/CC simple/NN ./.
As/IN we/PRP were/VBD finishing/VBG up/IN she/PRP came/VBD by/IN with/IN the/DT check/NN and/CC placed/VB it/PRP on/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD near/JJ to/TO finishing/NN at/IN about/IN 10/CD after/IN 9/CD and/CC not/RB nearly/RB 3/VB minutes/NNS go/RB by/IN until/IN she/PRP comes/VBZ by/IN to/TO tell/NN us/PRP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO hurry/NN and/CC pay/NN in/IN such/JJ a/DT rude/NN way/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP big/JJ on/IN customer/NN service/NN and/CC that/IN completely/RB changed/VBN my/PRP$ mind/NN about/IN the/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT coctel/NN de/IN camarón/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN from/IN the/DT waitress/NN was/VBD awful/JJ due/JJ to/TO her/PRP$ rudeness/NN ,/, which/WDT makes/-NONE- me/VBZ not/RB want/VB to/TO return/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP maybe/JJ she/PRP was/VBD tired/VBN and/CC wanted/VBD to/TO finish/JJ her/NN shift/NN but/CC there/EX was/VBD still/RB a/DT family/NN of/IN 4/CD next/JJ to/TO us/PRP who/WP arrived/VBN much/RB later/JJ than/IN us/PRP and/CC she/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN said/VBN it/PRP in/IN a/DT much/JJ better/NN form/NN ./.
My/NNP mom/NN asked/VBD her/PRP a/DT question/NN in/IN a/DT polite/JJ way/NN as/IN I/PRP was/VBD paying/JJ and/CC when/WRB the/DT waitress/NN was/VBD going/VBG to/TO answer/JJR she/PRP seemed/VBD bothered/VBN to/TO answer/VB the/DT question/NN ./.
Really/RB ?/. !/.
Bottom/NNP line/NN ,/, food/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC service/NN was/VBD bad/JJ ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB been/VBN to/TO a/DT place/NN where/WRB they/PRP hurry/VBP up/RP their/PRP$ customers/NNS to/TO pay/VB ./.
Who/NNP does/VBZ that/IN ?/NN !/.
And/CC if/IN that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT case/NN ,/, maybe/NN they/PRP should/MD consider/VB changing/VBG their/PRP$ closing/JJ hour/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB them/PRP enough/JJ time/NN to/TO do/VB what/WP they/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB before/IN their/PRP$ actual/JJ closing/JJ time/NN ./.

Tried/IN the/DT tacos/NNS ``/`` Gobernadores/NNP ''/'' ./.
These/DT are/VBP great/JJ ./.
You/PRP must/MD try/VB them/PRP !/.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ clean/JJ seafood/NN restaurant/NN ./.
Not/RB really/RB expensive/JJ and/CC the/DT portions/NNS are/VBP a/DT good/JJ size/NN ./.

Very/NNP good/VBD soup/NN they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP when/WRB you/PRP get/VBP seated../NN really/RB great/JJ michaladas/NNS and/CC guac/JJ this/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ
Tostadas/NNP de/NNP ceviche/NN where/WRB delicious/JJ ,/, but/CC a/DT little/JJ high/JJ priced/NN @/NN 7/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/VBD got/VBD a/DT tostada/NN of/IN aguachile/JJ and/CC for/IN $/$ 9/CD it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB spicy/NN at/IN all/DT ,/, he/PRP even/RB had/VBD to/TO add/NNP hot/NN sauce/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB the/DT ceviche/NN but/CC not/RB aguachile/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD also/RB recommend/VB going/JJ midday/NN since/IN other/JJ reviews/NNS complain/NN about/IN loud/JJ music/JJ and/CC I/PRP went/VBD around/IN 2:00p.m/CD ./.
And/CC the/DT music/NN was/VBD fine/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD actually/RB pretty/RB empty/JJ ,/, so/RB service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ if/IN I/PRP will/MD be/VB returning/VBG to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ shrimp/NN cocktail/NN or/CC just/RB wait/JJ to/TO go/VB to/TO CA/NNP ?/.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT small/JJ shrimp/NN cocktail/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB what/WP we/PRP expected/VBP ./.
It/PRP lacked/VBD flavor/NN ,/, spice/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB for/IN avocado/NN as/IN It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB included/RB ./.
We/PRP also/RB ordered/VBD the/DT ceviche/NN tostada/NN and/CC it/PRP also/RB lacked/VBD flavor/NN ./.
The/DT pico/NN de/VBZ gallo/NN on/IN the/DT ceviche/NN had/VBD a/DT refrigerated/VBN taste/NN ./.
We/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB returning/VBG ./.
Very/NNP disappointed/VBD ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ way/NN over/IN priced/NNS for/IN the/DT average/JJ seafood/NN they/PRP try/VBD to/TO serve/VB in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT poor/JJ service/NN ./.
Then/RB when/WRB I/PRP tried/VBP to/TO use/VB a/DT certificate/NN from/IN Restaurant.com/NNP they/PRP would/MD n't/RB honor/VB it/PRP and/CC I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP paying/CD full/JJ price/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD n't/RB ever/VB have/VB gone/JJ there/RB if/IN I/PRP had/VBD n't/RB seen/VBN it/PRP on/IN Restaurant.com/NNP ./.
I/PRP will/MD never/RB go/VB here/RB again/RB and/CC I/PRP will/MD tell/VB everyone/NN I/PRP know/VBP not/RB to/TO go/VB here/RB either/RB ./.
Went/NNP here/RB for/IN lunch/NN today/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN overall/JJ I/PRP was/VBD really/RB impressed/VBN ./.
They/PRP brought/VBD us/PRP chips/NNS that/WDT were/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
They/PRP were/VBD thin/JJ and/CC we/PRP actually/RB preferred/VBN to/TO use/VB them/PRP rather/RB than/IN the/DT crackers/NNS or/CC tostadas/NNS that/WDT came/NN with/IN our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB brought/VBD us/PRP a/DT cup/NN of/IN their/PRP$ soup/NN which/WDT was/VBD good/JJ but/CC a/DT bit/NN too/RB warm/NN for/IN this/DT weather/NN (/IN it/PRP was/VBD still/RB good/JJ ,/, maybe/JJ as/IN the/DT weather/NN cools/VBZ I/PRP will/MD order/VB some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ caldos/NNS )/VBP ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT campechana/NN while/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN ordered/VBD the/DT pescado/NN ceviche/NN and/CC even/RB though/IN we/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT medium/NN size/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB healthy/JJ portion/NN of/IN food/NN ./.
Many/JJ places/NNS skimp/NN on/IN the/DT seafood/NN but/CC this/DT place/NN gives/VBZ more/JJR than/IN enough/JJ to/TO fill/NN you/PRP up/RB ./.
I/PRP actually/RB wanted/VBD a/DT bit/NN more/RBR veggies/NNS because/IN it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN with/IN shrimp/NN ,/, etc/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ but/CC at/IN first/JJ we/NNS were/VBD one/CD of/IN only/RB two/CD tables/NNS but/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD quickly/RB filling/VBG up/RP ./.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/NN would/MD be/VB how/WRB warm/NN the/DT place/NN was/VBD because/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT few/JJ fans/NNS on/IN the/DT counter/NN to/TO help/VB cool/NN the/DT place/NN down/IN (/CD my/NN reason/NN for/IN four/CD stars/NNS )/RB ./.
Maybe/NNP something/NN was/VBD up/RP with/IN the/DT air/NN conditioner/NN but/CC with/IN seafood/NN you/PRP really/RB want/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN a/DT cool/NN place/NN ./.
Looks/NNS like/IN they/PRP listen/VBP to/TO their/PRP$ reviews/NNS because/IN the/DT music/JJ was/VBD low/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD easily/VB hear/JJ yourself/NN or/CC your/PRP$ partner/NN ./.

Will/NNP return/VBD again/RB to/TO try/VB some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ other/JJ dishes/NNS ./.

I/PRP thought/VBD prices/NNS were/VBD fair/JJ but/CC I/PRP eat/VBP a/DT lot/NN at/IN Scottsdale/NNP restaurants/VBZ so/IN it/PRP could/MD be/VB an/DT unfair/JJ comparison/NN in/IN prices/NNS

We/PRP just/RB tried/VBD the/DT jalapeño/NN dish/VB stuffed/VBN with/IN shrimp/NN and/CC cheese/NN wrapped/VBD in/IN bacon/NN ./.

My/NNP cocktail/NN crackers/NNS were/VBD not/RB replenished/VBN ,/, not/RB because/IN they/PRP refused/VBP to/TO but/CC because/IN the/DT waitress/NN never/RB came/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT table/JJ to/TO check/NN on/IN us/PRP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO get/VB up/RP and/CC walk/NN over/IN to/TO the/DT counter/NN to/TO have/VB my/VBN chips/NNS filled/VBD ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN would/MD let/VB them/PRP know/VB I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB happy/JJ but/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB work/VB ./.
