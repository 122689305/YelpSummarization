Idk/NNP why/VBD but/CC seems/VBZ like/IN the/DT food/NN quality/NN has/VBZ gone/VBN down/IN .../: Meat/NNP is/VBZ more/RBR fatty/JJ and/CC they/PRP are/VBP so/RB busy/JJ the/DT last/JJ two/CD times/NNS I/PRP got/VBD chicken/VBN it/PRP seemed/VBD under/IN cooked/JJ .../: Maybe/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB this/DT location/NN ./.
Great/NNP customer/NNP service/NN though/IN
This/DT was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/NN experiences/VBZ we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN at/IN any/DT Pei/NNP Wei/NNP ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC what/WP really/RB ticked/VBN us/PRP off/RP was/VBD the/DT manager/NN ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT registers/NNS was/VBD down/RB and/CC they/PRP were/VBD having/VBG trouble/NN ./.
The/DT manager/NN was/VBD doing/VBG nothing/NN but/CC standing/NN around/NN at/IN the/DT front/NN ,/, watching/VBG one/CD employee/NN juggle/NN the/DT line/NN while/IN he/PRP ate/VBP fortune/JJ cookies/NNS ./.
Extremely/RB frustrating/VBG to/TO watch/NNP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB it/PRP so/RB neither/VBP will/MD you/VB ./.
Crazy/NNP expensive/VBD for/IN starters/NNS ,/, and/CC small/JJ portions/NNS make/VBP this/DT a/DT place/NN to/TO drive/VB right/NN on/IN by/IN ./.
Total/NNP waste/NN of/IN my/JJ time/NN and/CC rescources/NNS ./.
My/NNP egg/NNP fu/NNP yong/NN had/VBD no/DT gravy/NN to/TO smother/VB it/PRP with/IN and/CC tasted/VBN funky/JJ anyhow/NN ./.
Wife/NNP had/VBD sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ chicken/NN which/WDT she/PRP said/VBD was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC she/PRP 'd/VBD eat/VB a/DT bucket/NN of/IN sh_t/NN if/IN it/PRP had/VBD a/DT bow/NN on/IN it/PRP so/RB that/IN does/VBZ n't/RB count/VB ./.
Seriously/RB find/VBD a/DT mexican/JJ chef/NN and/CC you/PRP 'll/MD experience/VB some/DT real/JJ Chinese/JJ food/NN ./.
Like/IN in/IN SoCal/NNP ./.
I/PRP know/VBP that/IN sounds/NNS crazy/JJ but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ Gospel/NNP ./.
Stopped/NNP in/IN for/IN a/DT last/JJ minute/NN dinner/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT broccoli/chicken/JJ and/CC when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD it/PRP was/VBD floating/VBG in/IN soy/JJ sauce/NN ./.
It/PRP looked/VBD more/RBR like/IN a/DT soup/JJ bowl/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT entree/NN it/PRP was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB ./.
The/DT manager/NN was/VBD very/RB kind/JJ and/CC had/VBD the/DT dish/JJ remade/NN but/CC by/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, my/NNP husband/NN had/VBD finished/VBN his/PRP$ dinner/NN and/CC dinner/NN was/VBD ruined/VBN ./.
I/PRP doubt/VBP that/IN I/PRP would/MD return/VB ./.
Me/NNP and/CC my/NNP wife/NN tried/VBD this/DT place/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN yesterday/NN .../: ./. what/WP a/DT mistake/NN !/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Pad/NNP Thai/NNP with/IN shrimp/NN and/CC steak/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD horrible/JJ !/NN !/NN !/NN !/.
the/DT steak/JJ tasted/VBN like/IN leather/NN ,/, the/DT shrimp/NN tasted/VBD like/IN rubber/NN balls/NNS of/IN bland/NN white/JJ fish/JJ ./.
I/PRP will/MD not/RB go/VB back/RB ,/, my/NNP wife/NN 's/POS meal/NN was/VBD horrid/JJ also/RB .../: An/DT off/JJ night/NN ?/.
do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, but/CC if/IN it/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN this/DT all/PDT the/DT time/NN ,/, they/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB in/IN business/NN much/RB longer/JJR .../:
Guaranteed/NNP !/.

Great/NNP for/IN catering/VBG family/NN get/NN togethers/NNS at/IN Grandmothers/NNP place/NNP ./.
We/PRP usually/VBP get/JJ 3/NN to/TO 4/VB trays/NNS for/IN 12/CD people/NNS ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB order/NN on/IN the/DT phone/NN ,/, they/PRP will/MD forget/VB about/IN it/PRP and/CC claim/IN they/PRP never/RB got/VBD it/PRP ./.
-__-/JJ
Never/NNP made/VBD it/PRP to/TO the/DT counter/NN to/TO order/NN ./.
Long/NNP line/NN and/CC employee/NN just/RB standing/VBG twiddling/VBG her/PRP hair/NN at/IN the/DT online/NN to/TO go/VB counter/NN not/RB helping/VBG ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN there/RB a/DT few/JJ dozen/NN times/NNS and/CC it/PRP never/RB occurred/VBD to/TO me/PRP to/TO review/VB them/PRP ./.
As/IN soon/RB as/IN I/PRP find/VBP something/NN I/PRP like/IN I/PRP get/VBP it/PRP every/DT time/NN from/IN then/RB on/IN out/NN ./.
So/IN every/DT time/NN I/PRP order/VBP the/DT steak/JJ thai/NN coconut/NN curry/NN with/IN rice/NN and/CC extra/JJ sauce/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD happily/RB say/VB ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP NEVER/NNP been/NNP disappointed/JJ ./.
This/DT has/VBZ to/TO be/VB my/VBN favorite/JJ asian/JJ cuisine/NN restaurant/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB hurt/VB my/PRP$ wallet/NN ./.
45/IN minute/JJ wait/NN for/IN a/DT take/NN out/RP order/NN ./.
Tried/NNP calling/NN it/PRP in/IN ,/, but/CC now/RB I/PRP see/VBP why/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB work/VB ./.
Even/RB the/DT manager/NN is/VBZ ignoring/VBG the/DT phone/NN ./.
Have/NNP not/RB even/RB received/VB my/PRP$ food/NN yet/RB and/CC already/RB having/VBD a/DT bad/JJ experience/NN ./.
The/DT soda/NN machine/NN was/VBD completely/RB out/IN of/IN all/DT diet/JJ drinks/NNS ./.
So/IN I/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT front/NN to/TO let/VB her/PRP know/VB and/CC she/PRP pointed/VBD at/IN someone/NN else/NN and/CC said/VBD tell/NN her/PRP ./.
Because/IN that/DT is/VBZ my/VBG job/NN ?/.
Then/RB when/WRB I/PRP 'm/VBP trying/VBG to/TO tell/VB the/DT other/JJ person/NN how/WRB I/PRP was/VBD treated/VBN she/PRP was/VBD rude/JJ and/CC snapped/VBD at/IN me/PRP ./.
Very/NNP poor/VBD customer/NN service/NN ./.
Great/NNP service/NN and/CC food/NN ./.
Manager/NNP runs/VBD a/DT tight/JJ ship/NN ./.
Happy/NNP customer/NNP !/.
Pei/NNP Wei/NNP will/MD always/RB hold/VB a/DT special/JJ place/NN in/IN my/PRP$ heart/NN ./.
All/DT I/PRP get/VBP is/VBZ the/DT Steak/NNP Low/NNP Mein/NNP but/CC I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN their/PRP$ lettuce/NN wraps/NNS which/WDT are/VBP fantastic/JJ ./.
The/DT last/JJ couple/NN times/NNS I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT pick/NN up/IN the/DT lady/NN working/VBG there/RB (/IN wish/JJ I/PRP could/MD remember/VB her/PRP name/VB )/NN was/VBD extremely/RB polite/JJ and/CC seemed/VBD very/RB eager/JJ to/TO be/VB working/VBG there/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ and/CC I/PRP would/MD reccomend/VB it/PRP to/TO anyone/VB wanting/VBG to/TO try/VB a/DT good/JJ Chinese/JJ food/NN place/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ fantastic/JJ ./.
Spicy/NNP tuna/NNP salad/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, just/RB put/VBD the/DT dressing/NN on/IN yourself/NN ./.
Chicken/NNP friend/NN rice/NN is/VBZ always/RB spot/NN on/IN too/RB !/.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP notice/RB is/VBZ take/VBG out/RP seems/NNS like/IN more/JJR food/NN
Same/NNP consistent/NN quality/NN and/CC service/NN ,/, just/RB like/IN locations/NNS in/IN ca/NNP ,/, San/NNP Marcos/NNP and/CC others/NNP ./.
Good/NNP for/IN group/NN of/IN 8/CD ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ ,/, you/PRP can/MD order/VB a/DT few/JJ items/NNS and/CC try/VB it/PRP all/-NONE- ,/, family/NN style/NN ./.
Prices/NNS $/$ 8/CD to/TO $/$ 15/CD range/CD ./.
This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ Chinese/JJ restaurants/NNS !/.
I/PRP always/VBP get/VB the/DT honey/NN seared/VBD chicken/NN because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB the/DT right/JJ mixture/NN of/IN sweet/JJ and/CC tangy/JJ goodness/NN !/.
I/PRP like/VBP to/TO add/VB on/IN veggies/NNS for/IN $/$ 0.99/CD more/CD to/TO get/VB delicious/JJ crunchy/JJ snap/NN peas/NNS ,/, carrots/NNS and/CC broccoli/NN ./.
A/DT regular/JJ bowl/NN costs/NNS about/IN $/$ 8/CD with/IN the/DT veggies/NNS added/VBD on/IN ./.
I/PRP also/RB like/IN their/PRP$ chili/NN paste/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ kind/NN of/IN sweet/NN and/CC just/RB the/DT right/NN amount/NN of/IN spicy/NN ./.
They/PRP make/VBP it/PRP there/RB in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB fresh/JJ and/CC good/JJ ./.
It/PRP goes/VBZ very/RB well/RB in/IN their/PRP$ lettuce/NN wraps/NNS !/.
(/PRP$ Which/NNP are/VBP also/RB amazing/VBG ./. )/''
I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN both/DT traditional/NNS and/CC the/DT Thai/NNP lettuce/NN wraps/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP equally/RB good/JJ but/CC I/PRP always/RB go/VBP more/JJR for/IN the/DT traditional/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO say/VB is/VBZ I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB their/PRP$ Sweet/NN and/CC Sour/NNP bowls/NNS ./.
Something/NN is/VBZ off/RP in/IN the/DT recipe/NN so/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB taste/VB like/IN what/WP it/PRP should/MD in/VB my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Other/JJ than/IN that/IN the/DT Pei/NNP Wei/NNP locations/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO have/VB always/RB been/VBN clean/JJ with/IN polite/NNS and/CC courteous/JJ staff/NN happy/NN to/TO answer/VB any/DT questions/NNS I/PRP have/VBP ./.
If/IN you/PRP rate/VBP a/DT restaurant/JJ based/NN on/IN how/WRB often/RB you/PRP visit/VB it/PRP then/RB Pei/NNP Wei/NNP gets/VBZ five/CD stars/NNS ./.
Seriously/RB ,/, I/PRP eat/VBP at/IN Pei/NNP Wei/NNP at/IN least/JJS twice/NN a/DT week/NN because/IN I/PRP enjoy/VBP it/PRP so/RB much/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ high/JJ quality/NN ,/, inexpensive/JJ ,/, and/CC fast/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT place/NN offers/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ Asian/JJ d√©cor/NN different/NN from/IN all/PDT the/DT other/JJ restaurants/NNS out/IN there/RB ./.
I/PRP generally/VBP do/JJ not/RB like/IN cash/NN register/NN style/NN restaurant/NN where/WRB you/PRP wait/VB in/IN line/NN to/TO place/VB your/PRP$ order/NN and/CC then/RB try/VB your/PRP$ best/NN to/TO find/VB an/DT available/JJ table/NN ;/: however/RB Pei/NNP Wei/NNP makes/VBZ it/PRP work/-NONE- exceptionally/RB well/RB ./.
Rarely/RB am/JJ I/PRP in/IN line/NN long/RB and/CC rarely/RB am/VB I/PRP unable/JJ to/TO find/VB an/DT available/JJ table/JJ ./.
That/DT being/VBG said/VBN ,/, the/DT place/NN can/MD get/VB a/DT little/JJ crazy/NN on/IN Friday/NNP and/CC Saturday/NNP nights/NNS so/RB expect/VBP somewhat/NN of/IN a/DT loud/NN and/CC bustling/NN place/NN if/IN you/PRP go/VBP on/IN those/DT nights/NNS ./.
I/PRP generally/VBP do/JJ not/RB like/IN loud/JJ busy/NN restaurants/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, it/PRP suits/VBZ the/DT theme/NN they/PRP have/VBP going/VBN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP actually/RB entertained/VBN by/IN the/DT action/NN in/IN the/DT open/JJ kitchen/NN and/CC the/DT comings/NNS and/CC goings/NNS of/IN people/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT hip/NN little/JJ place/NN to/TO chow/NN down/IN ./.
I/PRP would/MD put/VB Pei/NNP Wei/NNP 's/POS food/NN up/RB against/IN any/DT so/NN called/IN ``/`` fine/NN dining/NN ''/'' Asian/NN restaurant/VB any/DT day/NN ./.
So/RB many/JJ times/NNS my/PRP$ wife/NN and/CC I/PRP find/VBP ourselves/NNS paying/VBG the/DT bill/NN after/IN eating/VBG at/IN some/DT fancier/JJR Asian/NNS restaurant/VBD only/RB to/TO say/VB to/TO one/CD another/NN ,/, ``/`` Pei/NNP Wei/NNP is/VBZ better/VBG at/IN half/PDT the/DT price/NN ./. ''/''
I/PRP especially/VBP appreciate/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP provide/VBP a/DT gluten/VBN free/JJ menu/NN along/IN with/IN half/DT portions/NNS and/CC brown/VBN rice/NN for/IN some/DT healthier/NN options/NNS ./.
Way/NNP to/TO go/VB Pei/NNP Wei/NNP !/.
See/NNP you/PRP tonight/NN !/.
PS/NNP ,/, I/PRP only/RB gave/VBD Pei/NNP Wei/NNP four/CD stars/NNS because/IN I/PRP believe/VBP five/CD stars/NNS should/MD be/VB reserved/VBN for/IN true/JJ five/CD star/NN dining/VBG experiences/NNS at/IN higher/JJR class/NN upscale/JJ restaurants/NNS ;/: however/RB within/IN the/DT fast/NN food/NN category/NN ,/, Pei/NNP Wei/NNP gets/VBZ five/CD golden/VBN stars/NNS from/IN me/PRP ./.
Even/RB though/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP Asian/JJ and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN Asian/JJ food/NN in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT Caucasian/JJ co-worker/NN explain/NN to/TO me/VB the/DT hierarchy/NN of/IN Americanized/JJ Asian/JJ cuisine/NN ./.
Top/NNP of/IN the/DT chain/NN is/VBZ PF/NNP Changs/NNP and/CC the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT barrel/NN is/VBZ Panda/NNP Express/NNP ./.

Affordable/JJ ,/, tasty/JJ ,/, probably/RB loaded/VBN with/IN MSG/NNP .../: but/CC hey/NN !/.
Sometimes/NNP you/VBD got/VBN to/TO have/VB your/VBN Mongolian/JJ beef/NN ,/, orange/JJ chicken/NN ,/, and/CC gigantic/JJ bowl/NN of/IN white/JJ rice/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN to/TO say/VB I/PRP was/VBD very/RB happy/JJ after/IN my/PRP$ Pei/NNP Wei/NNP lunch/NN ./.
