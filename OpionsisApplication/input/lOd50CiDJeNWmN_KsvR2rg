Mikado/NNP easily/VBD ranks/NNS in/IN the/DT top/JJ 5/NN best/JJS sushi/NN restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT GTA/NNP ,/, despite/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ out-of-the-way/JJ location/NN (/NN parking/NN at/IN the/DT back/NN through/IN a/DT narrow/JJ alley/NN )/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN kooky/JJ and/CC creative/JJ sushi/NN rolls/NNS ,/, this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB exactly/RB the/DT right/NN spot/NN --/: Mikado/NNP is/VBZ about/IN sushi/NN in/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ purest/JJS sense/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP 'll/MD come/VB to/TO appreciate/VB after/IN skimming/VBG the/DT ``/`` sushi/NN etiquette/NN ''/'' pamphlet/NN at/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN your/PRP$ menu/NN ./.

Even/RB though/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT lover/NN of/IN the/DT 'crazy/JJ rolls/NNS '/POS myself/NN ,/, I/PRP definitely/RB did/VBD n't/RB miss/VB anything/NN while/IN enjoying/VBG the/DT purist/NN fare/NN with/IN the/DT delicious/JJ house-made/NN soy/NN sauce/NN ./.
In/IN sum/NN ,/, Mikado/NNP is/VBZ a/DT must-visit/JJ spot/NN for/IN any/DT Toronto/NNP sushi/NN connoisseur/NN and/CC a/DT good/JJ take/NN off/RP point/NN for/IN newbies/NNS looking/VBG to/TO try/VB more/JJR 'authentic/JJ '/NN sushi/NN without/IN breaking/VBG the/DT bank/NN ./.
Keiji/NNP makes/VBD the/DT best/JJS saba/NN sushi/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP ./.
Who/NNP knew/VBD a/DT little/JJ touch/NN of/IN shiso/NN can/MD add/VB so/RB much/JJ dimension/NN to/TO the/DT sab/NN flavouring/VBG ./.
I/PRP definitely/RB recommend/VBP you/PRP to/TO reserve/VB for/IN the/DT sushi/NN bar/NN seating/NN ,/, so/RB Keiji/NNP can/MD serve/VB you/PRP whatever/VB he/PRP thinks/VBZ are/VBP the/DT best/JJS sushi/NN for/IN the/DT day/NN ./.

After/IN a/DT friend/NN told/NN me/IN he/PRP 's/VBZ had/VBD best/VBN sushi/NN in/IN Toronto/NNP ,/, I/PRP just/RB had/VBD to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT try/NN ./.

When/WRB I/PRP finally/RB got/VBD there/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD shocked/VBN how/WRB small/JJ the/DT parking/NN lot/NN is/VBZ ;/: located/VBN in/IN the/DT back/NN through/IN the/DT alley/NN way/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT very/RB small/JJ restaurant/NN but/CC luckily/RB the/DT place/NN was/VBD not/RB packed/VBN ./.
After/IN being/VBG seated/VBN ,/, I/PRP pulled/VBD out/RP a/DT list/NN of/IN sashimi/JJ item/NN that/WDT my/-NONE- friend/VBP had/VBD wrote/VBN down/RP for/IN me/PRP ./.
It/PRP did/VBD not/RB take/VB long/JJ for/IN the/DT seafood/NN to/TO be/VB served/VBN and/CC even/RB quicker/RB for/IN them/PRP to/TO disappear/VB ./.
One/CD thing/NN that/IN stood/NN out/IN for/IN me/PRP was/VBD when/WRB the/DT waitress/NN collected/VBD the/DT sweet/JJ shrimps/NNS '/POS head/NN ,/, deep/VB fried/VBN it/PRP and/CC served/VBD it/PRP as/IN another/DT dish/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD disgusting/VBG but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN so/IN friggin/NN '/POS awesome/NN !/.
Warning/NN :/: do/VBP n't/RB drive/VB into/IN the/DT back/JJ unless/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT super/NN skilled/VBD driver/NN with/IN a/DT small/JJ car/NN or/CC else/VB you/PRP will/MD get/VB stuck/JJ lol/NN Cheers/NNS ./.
Just/NNP had/VBD a/DT GREAT/NNP lunch/NN at/IN Mikado/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD my/VBN second/JJ time/NN there/RB ./.
When/WRB I/PRP ordered/VBP my/JJ lunch/NN ,/, the/DT waitress/NN asked/VBD me/PRP if/IN I/PRP like/VBP wasabi/NN on/IN my/PRP$ sushi/NN ./.
Something/NNP I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN asked/VBN at/IN a/DT Japanese/JJ restaurant/NN since/IN I/PRP was/VBD a/DT kid/JJ ,/, when/WRB Japanese/JJ restaurants/NNS were/VBD a/DT more/JJR authentic/JJ delicacy/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ clue/NN that/IN this/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ lunch/NN ./.
While/IN waiting/NN for/IN my/JJ food/NN ,/, I/PRP peered/VBD over/IN to/TO the/DT hand-written/NN a-la-carte/JJ sushi/NN menu/NN on/IN a/DT whiteboard/NN by/IN the/DT sushi/NN bar/NN ./.
I/PRP saw/VBD things/NNS like/IN Spanish/JJ Mackerel/NNP ,/, Sea/NNP Eel/NNP ,/, Abalone/NNP ,/, Tuna/NNP Belly/NNP and/CC King/NNP Crab/NNP ./.
A/DT very/JJ long/NN ,/, impressive/JJ selection/NN ./.
Had/IN the/DT Tempura/NNP Appetizer/NNP (/VBD $/$ 8.95/CD )/CD -/JJ great/NN ,/, a/DT creative/JJ variety/NN of/IN vegetables/NNS and/CC two/CD wonderful/JJ shrimp/NN ./.
Shrimp/NNP were/VBD a/DT bit/JJ less/RBR long/RB than/IN some/DT other/JJ places/NNS ,/, but/CC were/VBD also/RB more/JJR plump/NN and/CC perfectly/RB cooked/VBD ./.
Will/NNP definitely/RB order/VBD this/DT again/NN ./.
From/NNP their/VBD lunch/NN menu/NN ,/, I/PRP picked/VBD sushi/JJ set/NN A/NN ,/, the/DT largest/JJS and/CC most/RBS expensive/JJ (/NN $/$ 18.95/CD )/CD ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN 3/CD cucumber/JJR rolls/NNS ,/, 3/RB tuna/IN rolls/NNS ,/, and/CC 8/CD pieces/NNS of/IN nigiri/NN ./.
Every/NNP piece/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC special/JJ -/JJ no/DT filler/NN here/RB ./.
The/DT fish/JJ was/VBD noticeably/RB fresh/JJ and/CC the/DT pieces/NNS were/VBD surprisingly/RB large/JJ ./.
Even/RB the/DT Kani/NNP (/NNP crab/NN )/NN and/CC Tamago/NNP (/NNP egg/NNP )/NNP ,/, which/WDT I/PRP usually/RB do/VBP n't/RB like/VB ,/, were/VBD great/JJ !/.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT best-tasting/JJ sushi/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN this/DT city/NN ./.
Much/NNP better/JJR than/IN Sushi/NNP On/NNP Bloor/NNP and/CC New/NNP Generation/NNP ,/, which/WDT have/VBP great/JJ single/JJ items/NNS (/VBP salmon/JJ ,/, butterfish/JJ )/NN and/CC are/VBP very/RB cheap/JJ ,/, but/CC lack/RB overall/JJ consistency/NN ./.
This/DT sushi/NN was/VBD special/JJ ./.
You/PRP could/MD tell/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD authentic/JJ Japanese-made/NN sushi/NN ,/, unlike/VB the/DT Cantonese-run/NNP establishments/VBZ named/VBN above/IN ./.
So/RB ,/, the/DT difference/NN is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP 're/VBP paying/VBG a/DT bit/NN more/RBR and/CC getting/VBG a/DT far/JJ better/NN product/NN ./.
The/DT eel/NN was/VBD grilled/VBN to/TO order/NN ,/, the/DT salmon/NN was/VBD topped/VBN with/IN dust-fine/JJ lemon/NN zest/NN ,/, the/DT tuna/NN was/VBD impossibly/RB fresh/JJ and/CC creamy/NN ,/, the/DT cucumber/NN was/VBD cut/VBN impeccably/RB small/JJ .../:
The/DT other/JJ time/NN I/PRP went/VBD there/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD for/IN dinner/NN and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP Amaebi/NNP (/NNP sweet/JJ shrimp/NN )/NN ,/, my/PRP$ favorite/JJ piece/NN of/IN sushi/NN ,/, a-la-carte/JJ and/CC to/TO my/PRP$ surprise/NN ,/, the/DT double-shrimp/JJ arrived/VBN with/IN the/DT heads/NNS still/RB attached/VBN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD the/DT single/JJ best-tasting/NN Amaebi/IN that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
I/PRP could/MD go/VB on/IN and/CC on/IN ./.
If/IN you/PRP like/IN Japanese/JJ food/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB too/RB annoying/JJ for/IN you/PRP to/TO get/VB there/RB (/VBN #/NN 56/CD Bus/NNS from/IN Donlands/NNP or/CC Eglinton/NNP stations/NNP )/NNP ,/, you/PRP should/MD really/RB try/VB this/DT place/NN !/.
And/CC they/PRP have/VBP parking/VBG in/IN the/DT back/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT great/JJ way/NN to/TO have/VB special/JJ ,/, authentic/JJ sushi/NN (/NN think/VBP Sushi/NNP Marche/NNP ,/, or/CC even/RB Ame/JJ )/NN ,/, at/IN a/DT much/RB more/RBR reasonable/JJ price/NN ./.
Be/NNP sure/VBD to/TO check/VB the/DT operating/NN hours/NNS before/IN getting/VBG too/RB hungry/JJ ,/, and/CC call/NN ahead/RB during/IN peak/NN hours/NNS to/TO make/VB a/DT reservation/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG with/IN friends/NNS ,/, ask/NN for/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT private/JJ tatami/NN rooms/NNS ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT menu/NN on/IN their/PRP$ website/JJ !/.
Another/DT hidden/JJ Toronto/NNP gem/NN ./.
Why/NNS do/VBP n't/RB more/RBR people/NNS know/VBP about/IN this/DT place/NN !/.
Well/NNP ,/, the/DT main/JJ reason/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB about/IN in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN nowhere/RB ./.
I/PRP never/RB would/MD have/VB found/VBN it/PRP if/IN my/PRP$ parents/NN did/VBD n't/RB live/VB a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS away/RB ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP no/DT Sushi/NNP expert/NN but/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN so/RB far/RB ./.
After/IN around/IN 5/CD meals/NNS here/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN disappointed/VBN with/IN on/IN piece/NN of/IN sushi/NN ./.
Everything/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ ,/, tender/JJ and/CC perfectly/RB prepared/VBN ./.

Too/NNP many/JJ sushi/NN restaurants/NNS deliver/VBP plates/NNS filled/VBD almost/RB entirely/RB with/IN salmon/NN and/CC tuna/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT citrus/NN fluke/NN sushi/NN that/IN I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD ,/, a/DT partially-cooked/JJ shrimp/NN that/WDT was/VBD unusual/JJ ,/, some/DT shiso/NN leaf/NN ,/, generally/RB a/DT nice/JJ change/NN from/IN the/DT increasingly/RB homogenous/JJ sushi/NN restaurants/NNS ./.

Looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO trying/VB it/PRP again/RB ,/, and/CC curious/JJ to/TO see/VB if/IN they/PRP 'll/VBP do/VBP Omakase/RB ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/VBD trains/NNS at/IN the/DT Franco-Behring/JJ jiu/NN jitsu/NN academy/NN around/IN the/DT corner/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP stopped/VBP by/IN to/TO order/VB some/DT take-out/JJ before/NNS picking/VBG him/PRP up/RB ./.
