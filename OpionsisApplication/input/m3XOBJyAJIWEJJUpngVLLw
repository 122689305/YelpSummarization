A/DT tiny/NN little/RB shop/NN on/IN the/DT corner/NN that/IN you/PRP would/MD miss/VB if/IN you/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO fast/NN or/CC not/RB paying/JJ attention/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD on/IN a/DT weeknight/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD about/IN 8/CD PM/NNP ,/, so/IN they/PRP were/VBD of/IN course/NN ,/, out/IN of/IN some/DT items/NNS ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT long/JJ line/NN to/TO the/DT front/JJ door/NN of/IN people/NNS anxiously/RB awaiting/VBG an/DT ice/NN cream/NN treat/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP several/JJ lactose/JJ free/JJ items/NNS ,/, which/WDT caught/JJ my/NN eye/NN and/CC was/VBD refreshing/VBG to/TO see/VB ./.
The/DT shop/NN is/VBZ neat/JJ and/CC clean/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT cool/NN painting/VBG on/IN the/DT back/NN wall/NN and/CC some/DT seating/VBG both/DT indoors/NNS and/CC out/NNS ./.
The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB helpful/JJ and/CC extremely/RB friendly/RB ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB have/VB asked/VBN for/IN a/DT better/JJR customer/NN service/NN experience/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT chocolate/NN PB/NNP and/CC a/DT waffle/NN cone-delicious/JJ !/.
The/DT cones/NNS tasted/VBD especially/RB wonderful/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO stop/VB back/RB !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN love/NN with/IN the/DT interior/NN of/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC they/PRP also/RB offer/VBP outdoor/JJ seating/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD so/RB many/JJ yummy/JJ choices/NNS that/IN it/PRP was/VBD hard/JJ to/TO decide/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP finally/RB came/VBD to/TO the/DT agreement/NN on/IN Ted/NNP and/CC Bart/NNP ./.
Both/DT of/IN the/DT flavors/NNS mixed/VBP so/RB well/RB together/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC try/VB the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT flavors/NNS !/.
YAY/NNP !/VBD !/CD !/.
Finally/RB an/DT amazing/JJ ice/NN cream/NN shop/NN in/IN Charlotte/NNP .../: I/PRP had/VBD the/DT vanilla/NN heath/NN .../: it/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB fantastic/JJ .../: My/NNP friend/NN had/VBD the/DT strawberry/JJ and/CC toasted/VBD coconut/NN .../: .to/NN my/IN surprise/NN I/PRP even/RB liked/VBD hers/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP love/VBP ice/RB cream/NN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT must/NN try/NN .../: it/PRP just/RB may/MD become/VB a/DT regular/JJ spot/NN .../: I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP will/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN mine/NN .../:
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ !/.
Love/NNP the/DT decor/NN ./.
Not/IN a/DT million/CD flavors/NNS ,/, but/CC definitely/RB enough/RB ,/, particularly/RB from/IN a/DT homemade/NN place/NN ./.
A/DT good/JJ combo/NN of/IN unique/JJ and/CC classic/JJ flavors/NNS ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT location/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN tables/NNS inside/NN and/CC out/NN ,/, and/CC fantastic/JJ murals/NNS also/RB inside/VBP and/CC out/IN ./.
Makes/NNP for/IN a/DT very/RB cute/JJ ,/, insta-worthy/JJ atmosphere/RB ./.
I/PRP look/VBP forward/JJ to/TO returning/NN !/.
My/NNP kids/NNP loved/VBD the/DT cookie/NN monster/NN ice/NN cream/NN !/.
Great/NNP atmosphere/RB ,/, delicious/JJ ice/NN cream/NN ./.
What/WP more/RBR is/VBZ there/RB to/TO say/VB ?/.
Ice/NNP cream/NN yum/NN ./.
I/PRP likey/NN ./.
Eat/NNP ice/NNP cream/NN here/RB you/PRP no/MD be/VB disapoint/JJ ./.
Yum/NNP yum/NN for/IN my/PRP$ tum/NN tum/NN ./.
The/DT ice/NN cream/NN itself/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT bit/NN to/TO iron/VB out/RP in/IN both/DT service/NN and/CC the/DT options/NNS they/PRP offer/VBP ./.
First/NNP ,/, they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB do/VB sundaes/NNS ,/, but/CC rather/RB toppings/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ strange/NN -/NN that/WDT distinction/NN -/NN for/IN an/DT ice/NN cream/NN shop/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP they/PRP told/VBD me/PRP ./.
So/RB even/RB though/IN they/PRP have/VBP (/VBN delicious/JJ )/NN salted/VBD caramel/NN sauce/NN ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB get/VB a/DT caramel/NN sundae/NN -/JJ just/RB a/DT bit/NN on/IN top/JJ ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT line/NN can/MD take/VB a/DT while/NN when/WRB there/EX are/VBP more/JJR than/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN customers/NNS there/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP refuse/VBP call-in/JJ orders/NNS ./.
So/RB if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO support/VB a/DT local/JJ business/NN and/CC quickly/RB grab/VB some/DT ice/JJ cream/NN for/IN the/DT kids/NNS on/IN the/DT way/NN home/NN you/PRP 're/VBP out/IN of/IN luck/NN ./.
You/PRP 'll/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO wait/NN ./.
The/DT kids/NNS that/WDT work/NN there/EX are/VBP really/RB nice/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN general/JJ just/RB need/VBP some/DT more/RBR training/NN ./.
The/DT milk/NN chocolate/NN ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ out/IN of/IN this/DT world/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT trek/NN for/IN us/PRP ,/, but/CC we/PRP have/VBP stopped/VBN here/RB a/DT few/JJ times/NNS after/IN dinner/NN or/CC attending/VBG an/DT event/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT decent/JJ variety/NN of/IN flavors/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP have/VBP really/VBN enjoyed/VBN every/DT flavor/NN we/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN so/RB far/RB ./.
Last/JJ time/NN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD a/DT cheesecake/NN flavor/NN that/WDT was/VBD fantastic/JJ !/.
Prices/NNS are/VBP average/JJ ,/, staff/NN is/VBZ really/RB nice/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP enjoy/VBP sitting/VBG in/IN their/PRP$ outside/JJ seating/VBG area/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ drawback/NN is/VBZ parking/VBG is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ difficult/NN ./.
The/DT lot/NN is/VBZ small/JJ and/CC awkwardly/RB shaped/VBD ./.
Both/DT times/NNS we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, the/DT lot/NN was/VBD full/JJ and/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB several/JJ minutes/NNS for/IN someone/NN to/TO leave/VB ./.
Not/RB a/DT huge/JJ deal/NN ,/, and/CC worth/VBD the/DT wait/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ AWESOME/NNP ./.
They/PRP actually/RB know/VBP how/WRB ice/JJ cream/NN is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO taste/NN ,/, not/RB too/RB sweet/JJ and/CC a/DT little/JJ salty/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ become/JJ my/JJ favorite/NN ice/NN cream/NN spot/NN in/IN charlotte/NN and/CC the/DT guys/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN working/VBG when/WRB I/PRP stop/VBP in/IN are/VBP very/RB nice/JJ ./.
#/NN twoscoopsforlife/NN

It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT really/RB cute/JJ ice/NN cream/NN shop/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP cute/JJ artwork/NN on/IN the/DT walls/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ worth/JJ investigating/NN and/CC taking/VBG a/DT picture/NN of/IN ./.
But/CC the/DT best/JJS reason/NN to/TO come/VB here/RB is/VBZ of/IN course/NN the/DT ice/NN cream/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP the/DT usual/JJ Chocolate/NNP ,/, vanilla/NNP ,/, and/CC strawberry/JJ flavors/NNS but/CC they/PRP also/RB have/VBP creative/JJ flavors/NNS like/IN Cinnamon/NNP Toast/NNP Crunch/NNP ,/, one/CD named/NN for/IN the/DT Simpsons/NNPS called/NNP Bart/NNP (/NNP Butterfinger/NNP ice/NNP cream/NN )/NN and/CC several/JJ other/JJ flavors/NNS ./.

Both/DT were/VBD delicious/JJ but/CC I/PRP especially/RB enjoyed/VBD their/PRP$ use/NN of/IN the/DT actual/JJ cereal/NN in/IN the/DT Cinnamon/NNP Toast/NNP Crunch/NNP ./.
Around/IN the/DT place/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT few/JJ high/JJ top/JJ tables/NNS for/IN seating/NN and/CC a/DT kids/NN table/JJ which/WDT we/PRP saw/VBD a/DT couple/NN sitting/VBG at/IN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT patio/NN outside/NN ./.

The/DT total/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ pricey/NN .../: Until/IN I/PRP took/VBD the/DT first/JJ bite/NN ./.
The/DT ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ real/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ made/VBN on/IN location/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD really/RB tell/VB the/DT difference/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB light/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ and/CC the/DT massive/JJ two/CD scoop/JJ I/PRP had/VBD never/RB gave/VBN me/PRP a/DT stomach/NN ache/NN ./.

that/IN sign/NN looks/NNS old../NN ''/'' and/CC honestly/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN 's/POS kind/NNS of/IN what/WP they/PRP were/VBD going/VBG for/IN ./.
Completely/RB old/JJ fashioned/VBN ,/, nothing/NN 'new/NNS '/POS or/CC 'fancy/NN '/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ what/WP Ice/NNP Cream/NNP should/MD be/VB ./.
When/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD there/EX was/VBD a/DT pretty/RB long/JJ line/NN (/IN we/PRP were/VBD backed/VBN up/RP to/TO the/DT door/NN )/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP moved/VBD fast/NN !/.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, up/RB on/IN their/PRP$ chalk/NN (/NNS ish/JJ )/NNP board/NN ,/, they/PRP had/VBD erased/VBN a/DT majority/NN of/IN flavors/NNS and/CC had/VBD about/IN 10/CD left/NNS ./.
That/DT kind/NN of/IN speaks/NNS to/TO how/WRB much/JJ variety/NN they/PRP had/VBD to/TO start/VB out/RP with/IN though/NN ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP to/TO get/VB the/DT maple/NN walnut/NN in/IN a/DT waffle/NN cone/NN ,/, and/CC parents/VBD both/DT got/NNS peppermint/NN ./.
The/DT ice/NN cream/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO experiencing/VBG more/JJR creativity/NN in/IN flavors/NNS when/WRB I/PRP return/VBP ./.

The/DT outside/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN is/VBZ n't/RB flashy/JJ and/CC the/DT inside/NN just/RB has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ tables/NNS ./.
Simple/NNP ambiance/NN .../: unlike/JJ their/PRP$ ice/JJ cream/NN ./.
I/PRP decided/VBD on/IN the/DT vanilla/NN brownie/NN chip/NN ice/NN cream/NN ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, really/RB ./.
Ice/NNP cream/NN can/MD be/VB that/IN creamy/NN ?/.

I/PRP could/MD feel/VB the/DT calories/NNS just/RB running/VBG through/IN my/PRP$ body/NN and/CC I/PRP loved/VBD every/DT minute/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP also/RB never/RB seen/VBN a/DT waffle/NN bowl/NN covered/VBD in/IN chocolate/NN and/CC sprinkles/NNS on/IN the/DT inside/NN ,/, so/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO get/VB it/PRP ./.

OH/NNP SO/NNP GOOD/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
I/PRP tried/VBD a/DT few/JJ other/JJ flavors/NNS before/IN settling/VBG on/IN the/DT Vanilla/NNP Brownie/NNP one/CD ./.
The/DT cool/NN thing/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN was/VBD the/DT innovation/NN ./.
The/DT owner/NN literally/RB just/RB created/VBN that/IN flavor/JJ the/DT night/NN before/IN to/TO try/VB something/NN new/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT good/JJ variety/NN of/IN flavors/NNS ,/, so/RB something/NN for/IN everyone/NN !/.

It/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO find/VB a/DT local/JJ icecream/NN joint/IN these/DT days/NNS ./.
Two/CD scoops/NNS is/VBZ definitely/RB that/IN though/IN ./.
End/NNP to/TO a/DT perfect/NN date/NN night/NN and/CC the/DT icecream/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ ,/, the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ so/RB friendly/RB and/CC there/EX is/VBZ little/JJ better/NN in/IN this/DT world/NN than/IN sitting/VBG outside/NNS on/IN a/DT July/NN night/NN with/IN the/DT breeze/NN at/IN a/DT picnic/JJ table/JJ ./.
Went/NNP here/RB on/IN a/DT whim/JJ Thursday/NN afternoon/NN because/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN was/VBD some/DT craving/NN ice/NN cream/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB this/DT place/NN exceeded/VBD my/PRP$ expectation/NN !/.
The/DT inside/NN was/VBD really/RB cute/JJ with/IN lots/NNS of/IN wall/JJ art/NN ./.
All/IN the/DT ice/NN cream/NN flavors/NNS were/VBD unique/JJ and/CC special/JJ ./.
There/NNS were/VBD n't/RB too/RB many/JJ flavors/NNS where/WRB you/PRP would/MD be/VB overwhelm/NN but/CC just/RB enough/JJ to/TO have/VB you/PRP wanting/VBG to/TO try/VB a/DT few/JJ ./.
I/PRP got/VBD one/CD scoop/NN of/IN chocolate/NN cookie/NN cake/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD huge/JJ !/NN !/.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN hard/NN to/TO find/NN and/CC I/PRP almost/RB missed/VBD the/DT turn/NN ./.
But/CC besides/VBZ that/IN I/PRP have/VBP no/DT complaint/NN with/IN this/DT little/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.

Two/CD Scoops/NNP is/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ locally/NN owned/NN shop/NN with/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN flavors/NNS ./.
We/PRP hope/VBP to/TO see/VB non/JJ dairy/JJ offerings/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
We/PRP used/VBD to/TO really/NNS like/IN coming/VBG here/RB ,/, but/CC lately/RB the/DT flavors/NNS have/VBP been/VBN pretty/RB boring/JJ ./.
They/PRP no/VBP long/RB have/VBP inventive/JJ flavors/NNS or/CC vegan/JJ options/NNS (/IN other/JJ than/IN sorbet/JJ )/NNS ./.
Hopefully/RB they/PRP will/MD bring/VB back/RB whoever/JJR was/VBD making/VBG all/PDT the/DT crazy/NN creations/NNS we/PRP used/VBP to/TO love/VB ./.
Checked/NNP this/DT place/NN out/IN today/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN the/DT service/NN industry/NN ,/, and/CC trust/NN me/PRP ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB always/RB the/DT case/NN ./.
We/PRP got/VBD to/TO try/VB a/DT bunch/NN of/IN flavors/NNS ,/, AND/NNP everyone/NN was/VBD super/NN helpful/JJ ./.
Unlike/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT reviews/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN on/IN here/RB ,/, the/DT portion/NN size/NN was/VBD plentiful/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Pricing/NNP was/VBD right/RB on/IN point/NN with/IN what/WP you/PRP expect/VBP at/IN a/DT quaint/JJ yet/NN trendy/NN ice/NN cream/NN spot/NN ;/: yes/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB more/JJR than/IN Dairy/NNP Queen/NNP ,/, but/CC you/PRP 're/VBP paying/VBG for/IN quality/NN ,/, options/NNS ,/, service/NN ,/, etc/JJ etc/NN ./.
My/NNP only/RB wish/JJ is/VBZ that/IN there/RB was/VBD a/DT little/JJ more/RBR seating/JJ ./.

The/DT people/NNS working/NN at/IN the/DT counter/NN were/VBD so/RB very/RB sweet/JJ and/CC apologized/JJ as/IN they/PRP informed/VBD us/PRP they/PRP had/VBD a/DT freezer/NN malfunction/NN and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT ice/JJ creams/NNS were/VBD out/RB because/IN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB survive/VB the/DT freezer/NN issue/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT problem/NN ,/, though/RB ,/, there/EX were/VBD still/RB many/JJ options/NNS to/TO choose/NN from/IN ./.

My/NNP only/RB recommendation/NN is/VBZ to/TO add/VB their/PRP$ flavor/NN list/NN with/IN descriptions/NNS on/IN the/DT wall/NN ;/: customers/NNS get/VBP bottle/IN necked/JJ when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ time/NN to/TO order/NN because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP just/RB seeing/VBG the/DT flavors/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO come/VB with/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC be/VB able/JJ to/TO relax/NN inside/NN !/.

My/NNP only/RB thing/VBD with/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ parking/VBG (/RB unless/IN )/NN there/EX was/VBD parking/VBG nearby/NN that/IN was/VBD bigger/JJ ./.
But/CC the/DT parking/NN lot/NN is/VBZ super/NN tight/NN with/IN maybe/NN 20/NNS spaces/NNS maximum/NN ./.
Overall/IN I/PRP liked/VBD this/DT place/NN ,/, will/MD be/VB returning/VBG ./.

Since/IN our/PRP$ mom/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN the/DT hospital/NN for/IN the/DT past/JJ four/CD months/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ brother/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN coping/VBG with/IN almost/RB daily/JJ trips/NNS for/IN ice/NN cream/NN after/IN spending/NN the/DT day/NN with/IN her/PRP ./.

The/DT interior/NN is/VBZ bright/JJ and/CC colorful/JJ ,/, everything/NN meant/NN to/TO cheer/NN up/RB and/CC brighten/JJ one/NN 's/POS day/NN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT mixture/NN of/IN indoor/NN high/JJ top/JJ seating/NN ,/, little/RB tot/NN seating/NN ,/, and/CC outdoor/NN picnic/NN tables/NNS with/IN benches/NNS ./.

The/DT flavors/NNS change/VBD out/IN regularly/RB ,/, if/IN not/RB on/IN a/DT daily/JJ basis/NN ./.
Hence/NNP my/VBD justification/NN to/TO get/VB two/CD scoops/NNS rather/RB than/IN one/CD in/IN case/NN the/DT flavor/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP interested/JJ in/IN trying/NN may/MD not/RB be/VB there/RB the/DT next/JJ time/NN around/IN ./.
Ok/NNP ,/, that/IN only/RB happened/VBN once/RB and/CC I/PRP barely/RB finished/VBD it/PRP off/IN since/IN they/PRP are/VBP pretty/RB big/JJ scoops/NNS !/.
