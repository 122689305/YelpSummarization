I/PRP left/VBD Table/JJ 17/CD feeling/VBG very/RB ambivalent/JJ ./.
Meh/NNP as/IN others/NNS would/MD put/VB it/PRP ./.
Some/DT things/NNS good/JJ somethings/NNS not/RB so/RB great/JJ but/CC on/IN the/DT whole/JJ in/IN between/NNP ./.
The/DT room/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ ,/, farmhouse/JJ chic/NN :/: long/JJ harvest/NN table/JJ ,/, ornamental/JJ roosters/NNS and/CC wooden/VBN chairs/NNS with/IN cushions/NNS for/IN seating/NN ./.
Sundays/NNP and/CC Mondays/NNP they/PRP have/VBP a/DT decent/JJ prix/NN fix/NN menu/NN on/IN offer/NN or/CC you/PRP can/MD order/VB a/DT la/NN carte/NN from/IN their/PRP$ shared/JJ plates/NNS menu/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT steak/JJ frites/NNS and/CC salad/JJ off/IN the/DT table/JJ d'hote/NN ./.
Spinach/JJ salad/JJ came/NN nicely/RB dressed/VBD though/IN the/DT dressing/NN was/VBD plain/NN could/MD have/VB used/VBN more/JJR tartness/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT few/JJ slight/NN issues/NNS with/IN the/DT steak/JJ frites/NNS ,/, the/DT steak/NN came/VBD closer/NN to/TO medium/NN when/WRB medium/NN rare/NN was/VBD requested/VBN and/CC was/VBD under/IN seasoned/VBN ./.
My/NNP accompaniment/NN of/IN frites/NNS (/VBG which/WDT were/VBD wonderful/JJ btw/JJ )/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN was/VBD too/RB liberally/RB salted/VBN with/IN kosher/NN salt/NN so/IN I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP got/VBD the/DT best/JJS of/IN both/DT worlds/NNS !/.
The/DT Bearnaise/NNP sauce/NN sauce/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN was/VBD so-so/JJ and/CC did/VBD n't/RB do/VB too/RB much/RB to/TO perk/VB up/RP the/DT steak/NN ./.
Dessert/NNP was/VBD chilled/VBN rhubarb/NN with/IN creme/NN anglaise/NN really/RB lovely/RB but/CC too/RB much/RB sugar/NN in/IN the/DT sauce/NN and/CC the/DT sprig/NN of/IN thyme/NN thrown/NN in/IN kinda/NN messed/VBN with/IN my/PRP$ tastebuds/NNS ,/, I/PRP really/RB should/MD have/VB plucked/VBN it/PRP out/IN !/.
My/NNP server/NN was/VBD a/DT lovely/RB affable/JJ gentlemen/NNS who/WP was/VBD very/RB friendly/RB ,/, warm/NN and/CC quick/NN on/IN his/PRP$ toes/NNS ./.
I/PRP did/VBD like/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD so-so/JJ and/CC I/PRP find/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP better/JJR bistro/NN options/NNS around/IN town/NN ./.
for/IN the/DT time/NN being/VBG ,/, for/IN all/DT its/PRP$ worth/JJ ,/, i/JJ am/NN going/VBG to/TO stick/NN to/TO the/DT magical/JJ number/NN three/CD ./.
okay/NN ./.
lets/NNS break/VBP it/PRP down/RB ./.
the/DT service/NN ./.
when/WRB we/PRP walked/VBD in/IN the/DT waitress/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB adept/JJ at/IN being/VBG the/DT problem/NN solver/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, slowly/RB this/DT role/NN for/IN her/PRP ,/, became/VBD more/JJR difficult/NN and/CC intrusive/JJ ./.
we/PRP were/VBD (/VBN ironically/RB enough/RB )/VB a/DT party/NN of/IN three/CD at/IN around/IN one/CD pm/NN on/IN a/DT friday/NN for/IN lunch/NN and/CC there/EX was/VBD not/RB a/DT three/CD person/NN table/JJ available/JJ ./.

not/RB the/DT best/NN ,/, but/CC so/RB be/VB it/PRP ;/: its/PRP$ one/CD pm/NN at/IN a/DT relatively/RB new/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC i/NN was/VBD prepared/VBN to/TO deal/NN ./.
i/NN will/MD say/VB though/IN ,/, with/IN no/DT regret/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ worth/IN it/PRP for/IN them/PRP to/TO reconsider/VB how/WRB many/JJ two/CD person/NNS tables/NNS they/PRP have/VBP versus/RB three/CD ./.
if/IN they/PRP are/VBP popular/JJ or/CC getting/VBG to/TO be/VB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ something/NN they/PRP might/MD need/VB to/TO reexamine/NN ./.
the/DT waitress/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT only/RB one/CD serving/JJ (/NN i/NN would/MD guess/VB )/IN the/DT 17/CD tables/NNS that/IN were/VBD almost/RB filled/VBN at/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB ,/, i/NN can/MD appreciate/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT hard/JJ go/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN it/PRP doesnt/VBD excuse/VB for/IN me/PRP her/PRP terseness/NN and/CC impatience/NN ./.
every/DT person/NN at/IN a/DT job/NN has/VBZ stress/NN to/TO deal/NN with/IN and/CC if/IN yours/NNS deals/VBP directly/RB with/IN customers/NNS ,/, you/PRP should/MD learn/VB to/TO keep/VB the/DT dealing/NN with/IN that/DT pressure/NN to/TO yourself/NN ./.
its/PRP$ not/RB the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT customer/NN ./.
its/PRP$ her/JJ job/NN to/TO figure/VB out/RP how/WRB to/TO make/VB that/DT work/NN for/IN herself/NN ./.
for/IN lunch/NN table/JJ 17/CD serves/NNS sandwiches/NNS ,/, salads/NNS and/CC a/DT soup/NN ./.
we/PRP each/VBP had/VBD a/DT sandwich/JJ ,/, a/DT salad/NN ,/, a/DT coffee/NN or/CC tea/NN and/CC the/DT bill/NN came/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB about/RB 60/CD bucks/NNS with/IN tax/NN and/CC tip/NN ./.
not/RB exorbitant/JJ and/CC not/RB cheap/VB ./.
though/IN im/JJ sure/JJ the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS used/VBD was/VBD high/JJ ,/, the/DT sandwiches/NNS felt/VBD like/IN they/PRP could/MD be/VB made/VBN at/IN home/NN ./.
in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN that/DT sentiment/NN i/VBD am/NN eager/NN to/TO admit/VB that/IN it/PRP takes/VBZ skill/NN to/TO know/VB when/WRB to/TO stop/VB cooking/NN something/NN ,/, to/TO pair/VB spices/NNS up/RP with/IN core/NN ingredients/NNS to/TO arrive/VB at/IN something/NN special/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB any/DT joe/NN will/MD have/VB the/DT wherewithal/JJ to/TO claim/NN he/PRP can/MD do/VB the/DT same/JJ whether/IN he/PRP thinks/VBZ so/RB or/CC not/RB ./.
but/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO charge/VB me/PRP somewhere/RB around/IN 9/CD bucks/NNS for/IN a/DT sandwich/JJ (/NN with/IN no/DT other/JJ sides/NNS except/VBP for/IN a/DT couple/NN pieces/NNS of/IN cauliflower/JJR and/CC a/DT sliced/VBD carrot/NN -/JJ which/WDT were/VBD good/JJ ,/, doused/VBD in/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN vinegar/NN or/CC pickled/VBN sauce/JJ )/NN then/RB perhaps/RB you/PRP should/MD use/VB dijon/JJ instead/NN of/IN yellow/JJ mustard/NN ,/, or/CC applewood/VB smoked/JJ cheddar/NN instead/NN of/IN havarti/NN ./.
its/PRP$ fair/NN to/TO assume/NN for/IN the/DT general/JJ population/NN that/WDT 9/JJ bucks/NNS is/VBZ a/DT hefty/JJ price/NN for/IN a/DT sandwich/JJ and/CC with/IN that/DT in/IN mind/NN one/CD might/NN put/VB their/PRP$ ingredients/NNS where/WRB there/EX outstretched/VBN palm/NN is/VBZ ./.
that/DT being/NN said/VBD the/DT sandwiches/NNS tasted/VBD great/JJ ./.
(/IN one/CD thing/NN has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT other/JJ should/NN you/PRP be/VB saying/VBG to/TO yourself/JJ something/NN along/IN the/DT lines/NN of/IN ``/`` well/RB then/RB what/VB the/DT hell/NN is/VBZ he/PRP complaining/VBG about/IN ''/'' )/NN ./.
the/DT vegetables/NNS that/WDT came/VBD on/IN separate/JJ plates/NNS alongside/VBP the/DT sandwiches/NNS were/VBD 4/VBN dollars/NNS each/DT ./.
we/PRP had/VBD three/CD kinds/NNS ./.
one/CD was/VBD sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS dressed/VBD with/IN chilies/NNS ,/, toasted/VBN coriander/NN ,/, mint/NN and/CC olive/JJ oil/NN ./.
another/DT was/VBD called/VBN farro/NN ,/, an/DT ancient/JJ tuscan/JJ grain/NN dressed/VBD with/IN extra/JJ virgin/NN olive/NN oil/NN ,/, cucumber/NN ,/, carrot/NN ,/, and/CC fine/NN herbs/NNS ./.
and/CC the/DT last/JJ one/CD was/VBD chickpea/NN salad/JJ with/IN celery/NN ,/, pickled/VBD red/VBN onions/NNS ,/, rosemary/JJ ,/, parsley/NN and/CC lemon/NN ./.
i/NN enjoyed/VBD all/DT of/IN them/PRP ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD honestly/RB not/RB representative/VB of/IN their/PRP$ ingredients/NNS ./.
i/NN dont/VBD need/NN to/TO have/VB my/VBN dishes/NNS overpowered/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ listed/JJ ingredients/NNS ,/, but/CC if/IN something/NN says/VBZ its/PRP$ going/NN to/TO be/VB flavoured/VBN by/IN mint/NN ,/, fine/NN herbs/NNS and/CC lemon/NN dont/NN you/PRP think/VBP you/PRP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO experience/NN that/IN as/IN you/PRP taste/VBP it/PRP ?/.
i/NN think/NN so/RB ./.
again/RB ,/, to/TO reiterate/VB ,/, i/NNP didnt/VBD mind/IN the/DT natural/JJ taste/NN of/IN the/DT vegetable/JJ offered/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN thats/NNS the/DT way/NN it/PRP will/MD end/VB up/RP tasting/VBG ,/, perhaps/RB you/PRP should/MD say/VB so/RB ./.
all/DT my/NN peeves/NNS aside/VB ,/, i/NNP am/NNP still/RB interested/VBD in/IN trying/NNP this/DT place/NN out/IN for/IN dinner/NN ;/: the/DT feel/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, cool/NN and/CC relaxing/NN and/CC as/IN i/JJ looked/JJ at/IN their/PRP$ dinner/NN menu/NN it/PRP looked/VBD quite/JJ tasty/NN ./.

I/PRP went/VBD there/RB with/IN me/PRP boyfriend/VBD to/TO celebrate/NN our/NN anniversary/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ my/NN colleagues/NN suggested/VBD me/PRP this/DT place/NN ./.

I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB frank/NN :/: the/DT only/RB way/JJ we/PRP could/MD afford/VB this/DT place/NN was/VBD due/JJ to/TO a/DT gift/NN certificate/NN from/IN a/DT generous/JJ wedding/VBG guest/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD right/RB on/IN the/DT money/NN ./.
Good/NNP flavor/NN ;/: prompt/NN service/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP have/VBP the/DT money/NN ,/, go/NNP !/.
We/PRP were/VBD here/RB for/IN brunch/NN a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS back/RB -/JJ delish/JJ !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ ,/, food/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ ,/, and/CC as/IN a/DT nice/JJ surprise/NN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB to/TO wait/VB all/DT that/DT long/JJ for/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
And/CC a/DT good/JJ brunch/NN ca/MD n't/RB just/RB rely/RB on/IN its/PRP$ food/NN for/IN good/JJ reviews/NNS ,/, so/RB the/DT answer/NN is/VBZ yes/NNS ,/, the/DT Ceasars/NNS were/VBD awesome/RB ./.
We/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB live/VB in/IN the/DT area/NN but/CC our/PRP$ visit/NN here/RB was/VBD really/RB good/JJ so/IN we/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB with/IN my/PRP$ sisters/NNS for/IN brunch/NN on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP so/IN there/EX was/VBD free/JJ street/NN parking/NN ./.
(/IN Yay/NNP !/NNP )/NNP ./.
The/DT decor/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC the/DT tables/NNS are/VBP well/RB spaced/VBN out/RP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN by/IN the/DT bar/NN area/NN close/NN to/TO the/DT entrance/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP huge/JJ windows/NNS which/WDT are/VBP nice/JJ but/CC get/RB in/IN your/PRP$ eyes/NNS in/IN the/DT day/NN so/IN we/PRP asked/VBD the/DT servers/NNS to/TO bring/VB down/IN the/DT shades/NNS ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC not/RB the/DT best/JJS since/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD pretty/RB full/JJ and/CC they/PRP only/RB had/VBD two/CD servers/NNS ./.
The/DT brunch/NN menu/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB diverse/JJ and/CC goes/VBZ beyond/IN the/DT typical/JJ french/NN toast/NN ,/, pancakes/NNS ,/, scrambled/VBD eggs/NNS with/IN sausage/bacon/ham/NNP &/CC hash/JJ browns/NNS deal/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD The/DT Sloppy/NNP Guisseppe/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT plate/NN of/IN a/DT couple/NN fried/VBN eggs/NNS over/IN bolognese/NN sauce/NN and/CC fried/VBN polenta/NN and/CC fresh/JJ greens/NNS with/IN a/DT vinaigrette/NN dressing/NN ./.
The/DT bolognese/NN sauce/NN was/VBD really/RB meaty/JJ and/CC thick/JJ -/JJ delicious/JJ and/CC paired/VBD with/IN fried/JJ eggs/NNS ,/, you/PRP just/RB ca/VBP n't/RB go/VB wrong/JJ ./.
The/DT fried/VBN polenta/NN did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB ``/`` fried/VBN ''/'' as/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB crispy/NN ;/: not/RB even/RB around/IN the/DT edges/NNS which/WDT made/VBD the/DT dish/JJ mushy/JJ .../NN but/CC then/RB again/RB ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ probably/RB why/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ called/VBN the/DT ``/`` Sloppy/NNP ''/'' Guisseppe/NNP ./.
I/PRP would/MD have/VB preferred/VBN if/IN I/PRP had/VBD at/IN least/JJS toasted/VBN bread/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN for/IN a/DT crunch/NN or/CC simply/RB just/RB a/DT different/JJ texture/NN (/IN the/DT salad/NN was/VBD n't/RB enough/RB )/VB ./.
My/NNP sisters/NNS had/VBD the/DT Pain/NNP Dore/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ french/JJ toast/NN with/IN cinnamon/NN creme/NN anglaise/NN &/CC berries/NNS ./.
They/PRP liked/VBD it/PRP and/CC thought/VBD the/DT creme/NN anglaise/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ alternative/NN to/TO maple/JJ syrup/NN ./.
Had/NNP a/DT very/RB lovely/JJ meal/NN here/RB on/IN Saturday/NNP ./.
Came/NN at/IN 6:30/CD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB busy/JJ but/CC filled/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP left/VBD ./.
The/DT crowd/NN was/VBD definitely/RB older/JJR ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP saw/VBP anyone/NN under/IN 30/CD in/IN there/CD ./.
Decor/NNP was/VBD very/RB woodsy/JJ and/CC rustic/JJ ./.
But/CC at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT food/NN that/IN counts/NNS !/.
We/PRP had/VBD .../:
Hot/NNP balls/NNS :/: lamb/JJ risotto/NN ,/, mushroom/NN and/CC fontina/NN risotto/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT goat/NN cheese/NN and/CC honey/NN balls/NNS ./.
You/PRP get/VBP three/CD little/JJ timbit/NN sized/VBD balls/NNS for/IN 7/NN bucks/NNS which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD very/RB reasonable/JJ ./.
They/PRP were/VBD so/RB delicious/JJ ,/, I/PRP wished/VBD we/PRP had/VBD gotten/VBN the/DT double/JJ portion/NN after/IN we/PRP were/VBD finished/VBN ./.
Polenta/NNP w//VBD Sausage/NNP Sugo/NNP :/: My/NNP affection/NN for/IN polenta/NN knows/VBZ no/DT bounds/NNS so/IN I/PRP loved/VBD every/DT little/JJ spoonful/NN of/IN this/DT ./.
It/PRP came/VBD out/RP on/IN a/DT slice/NN of/IN a/DT tree/NN trunk/NN which/WDT allowed/-NONE- the/DT polenta/NN to/TO slowly/RB spread/VB out/RP perfectly/RB over/IN the/DT dish/JJ ./.
Polenta/NNP was/VBD creamy/JJ and/CC had/VBD a/DT nice/JJ umami/NN flavour/NN ./.
Good/NNP liquid-to-polenta/NN ratio/NN made/VBD this/DT comforting/NN and/CC incredibly/RB addictive/JJ ./.
Chef/NNP came/VBD out/RP and/CC laid/VBD the/DT hot/NN sausage/NN meat/NN sauce/JJ right/NN on/IN top/JJ of/IN it/PRP ./.
We/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP so/RB much/RB ,/, we/PRP made/VBD it/PRP at/IN home/NN the/DT next/JJ day/NN .../: seriously/RB ./.
Steak/NNP tartare/NN w//NN frites/NNS and/CC salad/NN :/: Delish/NNP and/CC flavourful/JJ tartare/NN ./.

None/NN of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS even/RB remotely/RB disappointed/JJ me/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD solid/JJ ./.
One/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favourite/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT neighbourhood/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ consistent/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN impeccable/JJ ./.
The/DT steak/JJ frites/NNS are/VBP the/DT best/JJS in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
Scallops/NNP ,/, duck/JJ confit/NN and/CC short/JJ ribs/NNS are/VBP also/RB regular/JJ favourites/NNS ./.
Literally/RB my/VBD FAVORITE/NNP new/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT northern/JJ hemisphere/NN ./.

Everything/NN from/IN the/DT friendly/JJ and/CC funny/JJ staff/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT custom/NN vegetarian/JJ dinner/NN that/IN the/DT teens/NNS devoured/VBD ,/, was/VBD spectacular/JJ ./.
The/DT highlights/NNS :/: Hot/NNP balls/NNS ,/, Brussel/NNP Sprouts/NNP ,/, Diver/NNP scallops/NNS ,/, Tartare/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT pasta/NN was/VBD so/RB light/JJ and/CC tender/JJ with/IN incredible/JJ delicate/NN flavors/NNS Kudos/NNP ./.
We/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB soon/RB !/.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP came/VBD to/TO Table/JJ 17/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ over/IN a/DT year/NN ago/IN ./.
I/PRP took/VBD my/PRP$ grandmother/NN and/CC my/PRP$ aunt/NN out/IN for/IN dinner/NN ./.
The/DT moment/NN I/PRP came/VBD to/TO this/DT place/NN I/PRP was/VBD very/RB impressed/VBN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ this/DT very/RB home-y/JJ feel/NN and/CC decor/NN ./.
Nothing/NN felt/VBD overwhelming/VBG ./.
We/PRP came/VBD on/IN a/DT Monday/NNP night/NN ./.
(/IN To/TO my/PRP$ knowledge/NN Sunday/NNP and/CC Monday/NNP nights/NNS Table17/CD offers/NNS prix/VBP fixe/JJ menu/NN ./. )/''
We/PRP all/VBP ordered/RB different/JJ staters/NNS ,/, steak/JJ and/CC different/JJ desserts/NNS !/.
However/RB ,/, what/WP made/VBN me/PRP fall/VBP in/IN love/NN with/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ thee/RB amazing/VBG home/NN made/VBD olive/JJ oil/NN ./.
Their/NNP olive/NN oil/NN tasted/VBD amazingly/RB fresh/JJ and/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC eat/VB all/DT of/IN their/PRP$ fresh/JJ bread/JJ with/IN it/PRP ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, in/IN multiple/NN occasions/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP asked/VBN if/IN I/PRP could/MD purchase/VB a/DT bottle/NN and/CC to/TO my/VB disappointment/NN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB sell/VB their/PRP$ olive/JJ oil/NN ./.
:/: (/JJ The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP found/VBD about/IN this/DT place/NN that/IN did/VBD not/RB satisfy/VB my/JJ expectations/NNS were/VBD tht/RB the/DT servers/NNS are/VBP very/RB slow/JJ and/CC not/RB as/RB hospitable/JJ as/IN other/JJ servers/NNS from/IN my/PRP$ other/JJ experiences/NNS ./.
Overall/IN ,/, I/PRP definitely/RB recommend/VBP this/DT place/NN ./.
Especially/RB their/PRP$ duck/NN confit/NN which/WDT is/VBZ amazing/VBG !/.
-CL/JJ PS/NNS they/PRP take/VBP reservations/NNS and/CC it/PRP gets/VBZ pretty/RB busy/NN so/RB be/VB sure/JJ to/TO make/VB them/PRP ./.
:/: )/.
On/IN a/DT stormy/NN ,/, humid/JJ night/NN in/IN Leslieville/NNP ,/, my/NNP partner/NN and/CC I/PRP stumbled/VBD upon/IN this/DT welcoming/VBG looking/NN restaurant/NN with/IN the/DT rooster/NN out/IN front/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP turned/VBD out/RP quite/RB well/RB ./.
Though/IN the/DT category/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP is/VBZ listed/VBN as/IN French/JJ ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ much/JJ closer/NN to/TO Italian/JJ if/IN you/PRP had/VBD to/TO pick/VB a/DT cuisine/NN ./.
Right/NNP off/VBD the/DT hop/NN the/DT service/NN was/VBD questionable/JJ ./.
Benefit/NN of/IN the/DT doubt/NN moment/NN :/: it/PRP was/VBD after/IN 8/CD pm/NN on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP --/: which/WDT in/IN Toronto/NNP means/NNP you/PRP 're/VBP lucky/JJ if/IN anything/NN half-decent/NN is/VBZ open/JJ at/IN all/DT --/: and/CC the/DT place/NN seemed/VBD understaffed/JJ ./.
Still/RB ,/, having/VBG to/TO stand/NNP awkwardly/RB for/IN 10-15/CD min/NN in/IN the/DT non-foyer/NN ,/, while/IN waiters/NNS whisked/VBD by/IN us/PRP was/VBD not/RB too/RB pleasant/JJ ./.
And/CC once/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT table/JJ ,/, service/NN continued/NN to/TO be/VB spotty/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC self-effacing/JJ ,/, calling/JJ us/PRP his/PRP$ ``/`` little/JJ neglected/VBN table/JJ ./. ''/''
This/DT was/VBD not/RB inaccurate/JJ as/IN even/RB getting/JJ our/NN initially/RB requested/VBN waters/NNS (/IN it/PRP was/VBD sweaty/JJ out/IN !/NNP )/NNP
took/IN nearly/RB 10/CD minutes/NNS ,/, and/CC later/JJ he/PRP left/VBD us/PRP with/IN dessert/NN menus/NNS for/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS before/IN coming/VBG back/RB to/TO see/VB what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBP ,/, our/PRP$ appetites/NNS for/IN anything/NN sweet/JJ having/VBG seriously/RB waned/VBN ./.
Food-wise/JJ though/NNS ,/, things/NNS were/VBD great/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD n't/RB terribly/RB hungry/JJ ,/, and/CC so/RB avoided/VBD the/DT table/JJ d'hote/NN fixed/VBN price/NN menu/NN going/VBG with/IN the/DT ``/`` shared/JJ food/NN ''/'' section/NN on/IN the/DT left/JJ column/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT limited/JJ selection/NN here/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP ordered/VBP about/IN half/DT of/IN the/DT available/JJ items/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD not/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
Rich/NNP white/JJ polenta/NN ,/, brought/VBD out/RP on/IN a/DT wooden/JJ cutting/VBG board/NN was/VBD accompanied/VBN by/IN an/DT aproned/JJ chef/NN who/WP ladled/VBD a/DT ``/`` sugo/NN ''/'' of/IN veal/NN ,/, zucchini/NNP and/CC fresh/JJ basil/NN on/IN top/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD heart-warming/JJ ,/, subtle/NN and/CC delicious/JJ ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT generous/JJ portion/NN for/IN two/CD to/TO share/NN ./.
Alongside/IN the/DT polenta/NN we/PRP had/VBD two/CD smallish/JJ ramekins/NNS ./.
One/CD contained/VBD ``/`` sauce/JJ &/CC balls/NNS ''/'' a/DT cheekily/NN named/NN but/CC very/RB tasty/JJ take/NN on/IN classic/JJ meatballs/NNS in/IN tomato/NN sauce/NN ./.
The/DT other/JJ had/NN what/WP was/VBD possibly/RB my/JJ favourite/JJ dish/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN ,/, a/DT simple/NN roasted/VBN beet/NN preparation/NN with/IN blue/JJ cheese/NN ./.
The/DT multicoloured/JJ heirloom/NN beets/VBZ were/VBD ``/`` al/JJ dente/NN ''/'' but/CC tender/NNP and/CC went/VBD amazingly/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT semi-melted/JJ cheese/NN ./.
Wines/NNS were/VBD great/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
My/NNP glass/NN of/IN Rollegrosse/NNP red/VBD (/RB $/$ 11/CD )/-NONE- was/VBD smooth/JJ beyond/NN even/RB the/DT menu/NN description/NN ,/, and/CC my/NNP companion/NN 's/POS ``/`` Anna/NNP 6/NNP ''/'' white/JJ was/VBD very/RB dry/JJ and/CC very/RB refreshing/JJ ./.
In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT service/NN problems/NNS ,/, my/RB one/CD other/JJ issue/NN was/VBD the/DT post-prandial/JJ whiskey/NN ,/, a/DT single/JJ malt/NN (/VBD $/$ 13/CD )/-NONE- that/DT came/NN in/IN a/DT far-too/NN large/JJ glass/NN (/IN we/PRP were/VBD informed/VBN the/DT kitchen/NN was/VBD ``/`` out/IN ''/'' of/IN snifters/NNS .../: )/NNP and/CC which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD harsh/JJ and/CC not/RB to/TO my/PRP$ liking/NN ./.
But/CC that/IN could/MD be/VB a/DT matter/NN of/IN taste/NN ./.
Total/NNP cost/NN of/IN meal/NN for/IN two/CD :/: $/$ 77/CD +/CD tip/NN ./.

So/IN I/PRP definitely/RB recommend/VBP a/DT reservation/NN ./.
He/PRP had/VBD been/VBN to/TO Table/JJ 17/NN before/IN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD not/RB ./.
Of/IN course/NN there/EX were/VBD no/DT tables/NNS when/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD ,/, but/CC the/DT staff/NN were/VBD more/JJR than/IN happy/JJ to/TO seat/NN us/NNS at/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD thankfully/RB empty/JJ when/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD ./.
Usually/RB not/RB a/DT fan/JJ of/IN having/VBG a/DT nice/JJ dinner/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT barman/NN managed/NN to/TO do/VB a/DT good/JJ job/NN of/IN staying/VBG out/IN of/IN our/PRP$ face/NN ,/, but/CC being/VBG attentive/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
Of/IN course/NN the/DT seat/NN was/VBD n't/RB the/DT comfiest/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD our/JJ fault/NN ./.
Food/NNP :/: The/DT server//NN bartender/NN made/VBD sure/JJ we/PRP knew/VBP all/DT the/DT daily/JJ specials/NNS and/CC even/RB recommended/VBD a/DT few/JJ and/CC took/VBD our/NN drink/NN orders/NNS (/VBP just/RB beer/JJ )/NN ./.

My/NNP date/NN was/VBD n't/RB too/RB sure/JJ about/IN the/DT honey/NN at/IN first/JJ ,/, but/CC actually/RB really/RB liked/VBN it/PRP ,/, was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ flavour/NN with/IN the/DT mozzarella/NN ./.
The/DT warm/NN pumpkin/NN with/IN the/DT cheese/NN was/VBD my/VBN fave/JJ part/NN -/NN so/RB delish/JJ ./.
For/IN my/PRP$ main/JJ I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT pasta/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD capellini/JJ (/NN I/PRP think/VBP ,/, ca/MD n't/RB quite/VB recall/JJ )/NNS .../: with/IN gorgonzola/NN cheese/NN ,/, roasted/VBN hazelnuts/NNS and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ I/PRP 'm/VBP forgetting/VBG a/DT few/JJ ingredients/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD awesome/JJ -/JJ great/JJ mix/NN of/IN flavours/NNS and/CC the/DT pasta/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN perfectly/RB and/CC served/VBN hot/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD skeptical/JJ about/IN the/DT hazelnuts/NNS at/IN first/JJ but/CC they/PRP were/VBD a/DT great/JJ compliment/NN to/TO the/DT gorgonzola/NN ./.
The/DT portion/NN was/VBD pretty/RB big/JJ for/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN place/NN ,/, so/RB my/RB date/NN had/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN my/PRP$ pasta/NN too/RB and/CC he/PRP also/RB thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD yum/NN ./.
My/NNP date/NNP had/VBD the/DT beef/NN short/JJ ribs/NNS and/CC said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC that/IN the/DT meat/NN was/VBD falling/VBG off/RP the/DT bone/NN ./.
(/IN As/IN someone/NN who/WP does/VBZ not/RB eat/VB beef/NN or/CC pork/NN I/PRP was/VBD assured/VBN this/DT was/VBD a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ha/NN )/NN ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN root/NN vegetables/NNS and/CC parsnip/NN puree/NN ./.
Just/RB as/IN we/PRP were/VBD digging/VBG in/IN our/PRP$ server/NN brought/VBD a/DT little/JJ bowl/NN with/IN extra/JJ root/NN vegetables/NNS because/IN the/DT chef/NN had/VBD suddenly/RB realized/VBN my/PRP$ date/NN did/VBD n't/RB get/VB enough/RB ./.
Once/IN he/PRP pointed/VBD it/PRP out/IN we/PRP realized/VBD there/NNS were/VBD only/RB like/IN 3/CD mini/NN veggie/NN cubes/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ dish/JJ so/IN it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ that/IN the/DT staff/NN noticed/VBD before/IN we/PRP even/RB did/VBD ./.
We/PRP contemplated/VBD getting/VBG dessert/NN for/IN a/DT minute/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD pretty/RB stuffed/JJ ./.
Maybe/NNP next/JJ time/NN I/PRP 'd/MD skip/VB the/DT appetizer/NN and/CC try/VBD a/DT dessert/NN ./.
Only/RB main/JJ downfall/NN was/VBD sitting/VBG at/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT comfiest/NN to/TO sit/VB on/IN a/DT stool/NN and/CC it/PRP felt/VBD a/DT bit/JJ crowded/NN when/WRB other/JJ patrons/NNS were/VBD seated/VBN at/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD also/RB a/DT little/JJ chilly/breezy/NN as/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ near/IN the/DT door/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD cold/JJ out/NN ./.

Not/RB sure/JJ what/WP the/DT total/NN bill/NN was/VBD in/IN the/DT end/NN for/IN the/DT 2/CD drinks/NNS ,/, appetizer/NN and/CC two/CD mains/NNS ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ mains/NNS were/VBD around/IN $/$ 20-25/CD ,/, some/DT on/IN the/DT menu/NN were/VBD a/DT little/JJ pricier/NN ./.
Overall/IN great/JJ food/NN ,/, good/JJ service/NN ,/, cute/JJ place/NN ,/, fairly/RB priced/VBN (/NN though/IN pricier/JJR than/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ places/NNS in/IN the/DT neighbourhood/NN )/NN ./.

The/DT Lake/NNP Erie/NNP pickerel/NN is/VBZ equally/RB disappointing/JJ as/IN we/PRP begin/VBP to/TO pick/NN at/IN our/JJ food/NN by/IN this/DT point/NN ./.
The/DT radish/JJ fennel/NNP &/CC grapefruit/JJ ``/`` salad/NN ''/'' which/WDT to/TO me/PRP resembles/VBZ more/JJR of/IN a/DT slaw/NN is/VBZ bland/NN and/CC lacking/VBG oomph/NN ./.

There/EX was/VBD a/DT good/JJ feel/NN to/TO this/DT two/CD roomed/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, classy/NN but/CC not/RB fancy/NN ./.

We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT charcuterie/NN board/NN because/IN I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO compare/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT charcuterie/NN board/NN that/WDT my/-NONE- fellow/VBP yelper/NN ,/, Deanna/NNP and/CC I/PRP shared/VBD at/IN Swirl/NNP the/DT day/NN before/IN ./.

I/PRP mentioned/VBD this/DT to/TO the/DT waiter/NN when/WRB he/PRP asked/VBD me/PRP how/WRB my/JJ meal/NN was/VBD and/CC then/RB to/TO his/PRP$ credit/NN he/PRP brought/VBD out/IN an/DT little/JJ bowl/NN of/IN frites/NNS sans/NNS salt/NN ./.

My/NNP friend/NN began/VBD picking/VBG at/IN my/PRP$ plate/NN which/WDT tells/NNS me/VBD that/IN she/PRP was/VBD n't/RB sated/VBN by/IN her/PRP dinner/VBP because/IN she/PRP dived/VBD right/RB into/IN the/DT bowl/NN of/IN extra/JJ frites/NNS ./.

That/DT said/VBD ,/, the/DT menu/NN does/VBZ not/RB seem/VB to/TO have/VB changed/VBN very/RB much/JJ over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP almost/RB wish/JJ they/PRP would/MD take/VB that/IN risk/NN and/CC do/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT menu/NN refresh/NN ./.
I/PRP still/RB give/VBP it/PRP 4/-NONE- stars/NNS because/IN I/PRP go/VBP there/RB when/WRB I/PRP crave/VBP my/JJ favourites/NNS ./.

We/PRP both/VBP had/VBD a/DT app/NN main/NN and/CC desert/NN and/CC still/RB very/RB hungry/JJ ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT main/JJ problem/NN with/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB small/JJ to/TO accommodate/JJ people/NNS who/WP may/MD want/VB to/TO hang/VB out/RP after/IN dinner/NN and/CC have/VBP a/DT few/JJ drinks/NNS ./.

The/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN were/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ confusion/NN lies/NNS in/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT Caesar/NN at/IN brunch/JJ time/NN ./.
It/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB $/$ 4.50/CD or/CC $/$ 5/CD ./.
I/PRP saw/VBD they/PRP have/VBP a/DT super/NN special/JJ one/CD on/IN menu/NN for/IN $/$ 12/CD but/CC I/PRP can/MD not/RB justify/VB paying/NNS that/IN much/JJ for/IN a/DT Caesar/NN ./.

The/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN (/VBZ not/RB traditional/JJ brunch/NN obviously/RB )/JJ precipitates/NNS only/RB infrequent/JJ visits/NNS (/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP and/CC eggs/VBZ benny/JJ guy/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP mornings/NNS )/VBP but/CC when/WRB we/PRP go/VBP we/PRP love/VB it/PRP ./.

Table/JJ 17/NN hit/NN just/RB the/DT right/NN spot/NN ./.
We/PRP started/VBD with/IN a/DT charcuterie/NN plate/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD all/DT kinds/NNS of/IN good/JJ and/CC porky/JJ ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, it/PRP took/VBD FOREVER/NNP to/TO get/VB our/JJ card/NN charged/VBD for/IN dinner/NN ./.

For/IN our/PRP$ shared/JJ appie/NN ,/, we/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT Burrata/NNP because/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN looking/VBG for/IN a/DT good/JJ burrata/NN dish/VB since/IN I/PRP moved/VBD back/RB to/TO TO/NNP and/CC had/VBD not/RB found/VBN it/PRP yet.-/JJ I/PRP tried/VBD one/CD at/IN Reds/NNP last/JJ year/NN and/CC thought/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB creamy/JJ enough/RB and/CC unfortunately/RB ,/, this/DT one/NN missed/VBD the/DT mark/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN there/NN was/VBD not/RB mixture/NN between/IN the/DT mozza/NN and/CC cream/NN ,/, so/IN the/DT soft/JJ texture/NN of/IN the/DT burrata/NN was/VBD lacking/VBG ./.
The/DT flavours/NNS and/CC other/JJ components/NNS of/IN the/DT dish/JJ paired/VBN very/RB well../JJ just/RB wish/JJ there/NN was/VBD more/RBR creamy/JJ goodness/NN ./.
It/PRP happened/VBD to/TO be/VB Good/NNP Friday/NNP and/CC I/PRP really/RB did/VBD not/RB plan/VB to/TO eat/VB meat/NN that/IN night/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD debating/VBG between/IN the/DT pasta/NN and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT fish/JJ dishes/NNS but/CC there/EX was/VBD one/CD component/NN of/IN each/DT dish/JJ that/NN did/VBD not/RB speak/VB to/TO me/PRP ./.
On/IN a/DT whim/JJ ,/, I/PRP went/VBD with/IN the/DT scallops/NNS at/IN the/DT very/RB last/JJ second/NN ./.
It/PRP came/VBD in/IN a/DT creamy/NN broth/NN (/NN was/VBD not/RB a/DT fan/JJ at/IN first/JJ read/NN )/NN but/CC it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN quite/JJ some/DT time/NN since/IN I/PRP had/VBD some/DT good/JJ scallops/NNS and/CC I/PRP definitely/RB had/VBD set/VBN some/DT high/JJ expectations/NNS ./.
On/IN first/JJ bite/JJ .../NN ../NN
I/PRP was/VBD grinning/VBG ear/JJ to/TO ear/VB .../: the/DT scallops/NNS were/VBD perfectly/RB cooked/VBN ,/, loads/NNS of/IN flavour/NN in/IN the/DT broth/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP could/MD not/RB get/VB enough/RB ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB not/RB a/DT super/NN big/JJ fan/NN of/IN clams/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP can/MD not/RB really/VB comment/NN on/IN them/PRP ./.
None/NN the/DT less/NN ,/, I/PRP tried/VBD to/TO scoop/VB up/RP ever/RB last/JJ ounce/NN of/IN the/DT broth/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN !/.

S/NNP had/VBD the/DT banana/NN cheesecake/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP was/VBD hesitant/JJ about/IN because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ how/NN that/WDT could/MD go/VB well/RB together/RB .../: but/CC it/PRP was/VBD actually/RB surprisingly/RB subtle/JJ but/CC evident/JJ in/IN banana/NN flavour/NN ./.

I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Ontario/NNP lamb/NN with/IN merguez/NN sausage/NN (/VBD lamb/NN x/NN 2/CD !/NNS )/.

Lamb/NNP was/VBD cooked/VBN perfectly/RB (/JJ medium/NN rare/NN )/NN and/CC the/DT merguez/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.

I/PRP think/VBP these/DT are/VBP a/DT ``/`` must/MD have/VB ''/'' if/IN you/PRP come/VBP here/RB ./.

Its/PRP$ a/DT little/RB on/IN the/DT pricey/NN side/NN but/CC our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD great/JJ and/CC I/PRP enjoy/VBP the/DT vibe/NN ./.

Actually/RB ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB nice/JJ if/IN you/PRP could/MD order/VB 6/NN goat/NN cheese/NN hot/NN balls/NNS straight/RB up/RB ./.
My/NNP pickerel/NN was/VBD a/DT big/JJ bowl/NN of/IN meh/NN ./.

Slinky/NNP woman/NNP ordered/VBD the/DT arctic/JJ char/NN and/CC seemed/VBD to/TO have/VB no/DT complaints/NNS ./.

You/PRP get/VBP a/DT couple/NN slices/NNS of/IN decent/JJ bread/JJ before/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP hate/VB about/RB Leslieville/NNP is/VBZ it/PRP seems/VBZ so/RB dark/JJ ./.
The/DT strip/NN needs/VBZ some/DT BIA/NNP work/NN ./.
Quite/RB a/DT great/JJ meal/NN ./.

Nice/NNP wine/NNP list/NN ./.

Only/RB thing/VBD hindering/VBG a/DT 5-star/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO top/VB up/RP our/PRP$ own/JJ wine/NN a/DT couple/NN times/NNS ./.
