Stopped/NNP by/IN this/DT place/NN with/IN my/PRP$ mom/NN on/IN a/DT whim/JJ while/NN out/IN shopping/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB unassuming/JJ looking/VBG outside/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT inside/NN is/VBZ nicely/RB set/VBN up/RP and/CC pretty/RB relaxing/JJ atmosphere/RB ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT big/JJ selection/NN ,/, including/VBG duck/NN ,/, chow/NN fun/NN ,/, even/RB some/DT Thai/NNP stuff/NN ,/, etc/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT orange/NN chicken/NN combo/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD spicy/JJ and/CC orangey/JJ and/CC did/VBD n't/RB taste/VB quite/RB the/DT same/JJ as/IN everyone/NN elses/NNS '/POS typical/JJ recipes/NNS ./.
The/DT egg/NN drop/NN soup/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP probably/RB stop/VBN in/IN here/RB now/RB when/WRB I/PRP go/VBP shopping/VBG ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB better/JJR than/IN SF/NNP China/NNP town/NN but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ better/JJR than/IN China/NNP itself/NNP !/.
Best/NNP I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN on/IN the/DT west/JJS side/NN of/IN Phoenix/NNP tho/NNP and/CC much/RB better/JJR than/IN Panda/NNP Express/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
Food/NNP served/VBD quickly/RB and/CC service/NN is/VBZ unparalleled/JJ !/.
I/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB but/CC next/JJ time/NN with/IN my/NNP family/NN !/.
So/RB glad/RB .../: Phoenix/NNP seems/NNP to/TO be/VB devoid/JJ of/IN good/JJ Chinese/JJ food/NN !/.
FYI-/JJ food/NN looks/VBZ more/JJR greasy/NN in/IN photos/NNS than/IN actually/RB are/VBP !/.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
Server/NN was/VBD just/RB right/RB ,/, did/VBD not/RB really/RB have/VB to/TO ask/VB for/IN anything/NN ./.
Best/NNP part/NN they/PRP serve/VBP boba/NN !/.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ and/CC pretty/RB cheaply/RB priced/VBN for/IN any/DT type/NN of/IN Chinese/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN on/IN a/DT date/NN and/CC loved/VBD the/DT atmosphere/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC quiet/JJ and/CC was/VBD n't/RB insanely/RB bright/VB outside/JJ so/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ change/NN from/IN out/IN doors/NNS ./.
The/DT only/JJ issue/NN i/NN had/VBD was/VBD that/IN i/JJ waited/VBD like/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS to/TO pay/VB for/IN my/JJ food/NN because/IN the/DT lady/NN at/IN the/DT register/NN was/VBD messing/VBG with/IN the/DT toothpick/NN dispenser/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP this/DT place/NN a/DT lot/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP the/DT best/JJS fried/JJ rice/NN and/CC the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ./.

This/DT place/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
The/DT server/NN (/VBZ probably/RB the/DT owner/NN )/NN was/VBD so/RB very/RB nice/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP really/RB fast/NN and/CC was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
We/PRP had/VBD chicken/VBN fried/VBN rice/NN and/CC shrimp/NN fried/VBD rice/NN -/JJ portion/NN sizes/NNS are/VBP large/JJ and/CC there/EX was/VBD lots/NNS of/IN meat/NN in/IN both/DT ./.
The/DT spring/NN rolls/NNS were/VBD piping/VBG hot/NN and/CC had/VBD a/DT good/JJ flavor/NN ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP good/JJ and/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT large/JJ selection/NN of/IN dishes/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP know/VBP there/RB are/VBP n't/RB many/JJ good/JJ Chinese/NN places/NNS in/IN Arizona/NNP ,/, or/CC many/JJ other/JJ good/JJ places/NNS at/IN all/DT ,/, but/CC this/DT one/NN was/VBD decent/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP ordered/VBN take/JJ out/NN from/IN here/RB several/JJ times/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, portions/NNS were/VBD big/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD consistent/JJ each/DT time/NN I/PRP ordered/VBP ./.
The/DT mongolian/JJ beef/NN was/VBD great/JJ
Just/NNP had/VBD lunch/NN there/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB quite/JJ good/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP noticed/VBD when/WRB I/PRP walked/VBD into/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD fairly/VBN modern/JJ and/CC quite/JJ clean/JJ .../: Including/VBG the/DT bathrooms/NNS ./.
The/DT lunch/NN specials/NNS are/VBP fairly/RB priced/VBN ./.
The/DT soup/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, egg/JJ roll/NN hot/NN and/CC crispy/NN and/CC the/DT veggies/NNS crisp/NN and/CC fresh/NN in/IN the/DT garlic/JJ shrimp/NN entree/NN ./.
The/DT fried/JJ rice/NN was/VBD just/RB OK/RB ./.
Suggestion/NN to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN :/: serve/VB the/DT egg/NN roll/NN on/IN a/DT separate/JJ plate/NN so/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB get/VB soggy/JJ while/IN touching/NN or/CC sitting/VBG in/IN the/DT sauce/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ dish/NN ./.
Will/NNP definitely/RB go/VB back/RB ./.
Excellent/NNP food/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
The/DT portion/NN size/NN were/VBD large/JJ and/CC the/DT price/NN was/VBD reasonable/JJ ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN was/VBD quiet/JJ and/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD spotless/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB this/DT place/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT casual/JJ and/CC yummy/JJ place/NN to/TO have/VB excellent/JJ Chineese/NNP food/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD come/VB back/RB here/RB again/RB ./.
Found/NNP this/DT place/NN on/IN the/DT fly/JJ while/NN out/IN running/NNP errands/NNS and/CC starving/NN ./.
Owners/NNS were/VBD nice/RB ,/, especially/RB Husband..Very/NNP courteous/NN ./.
Place/NNP was/VBD clean/JJ and/CC we/PRP were/VBD offered/VBN water/NN or/CC a/DT drink/NN while/IN waiting/NN for/IN our/PRP$ takeout/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD very/RB ,/, very/RB bland/JJ .../: very/RB little/JJ flavor/NN at/IN all/DT .../: Kung/NNP Pow/NNP had/VBD what/VBN I/PRP considered/VBP too/RB many/JJ bell/NN peppers/NNS and/CC was/VBD n't/RB spicy/JJ (/NN hot/NN )/NN even/RB after/IN I/PRP asked/VBD if/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB spicy/JJ enough/RB ./.
Cheese/NNP puffs/VBZ bland/NN ./.
Eggrolls/NNP Bland/NNP ./.
Portion/NN sizes/NNS were/VBD Ok/RB but/CC sauces/NNS were/VBD much/RB more/JJR runny/NN than/IN other/JJ places/NNS .../: and/CC did/VBD I/PRP mention/VB bland/NN ?/.
our/PRP$ search/NN continues/VBZ .../: ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP the/DT Cantonese/NNP Noodles/NNP these/DT are/VBP ala/JJ Monterey/NNP Park/NNP ,/, Ca/NNP ./.
True/NNP authentic/JJ Chinese/NN cuisine/NN
I/PRP love/VBP AJK/RB ./.
Hands/NNP down/VBD my/CD favorite/JJ spot/NN for/IN Chinese/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP like/IN how/WRB when/WRB I/PRP order/VBP a/DT shrimp/NN dish/JJ they/PRP give/VBP me/PRP 12-13/CD pieces/NNS compared/VBN to/TO other/JJ places/NNS that/WDT will/MD give/VB you/PRP maybe/VB 5/NN or/CC 6/NN and/CC cut/VBD in/IN half/NN ./.
Really/RB good/JJ bang/NN for/IN your/PRP$ buck/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD say/VB though/IN I/PRP always/VBP used/JJ to/TO order/VB the/DT Roast/NNP Duck/NNP and/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN they/PRP changed/VBD the/DT flavor/NN or/CC cook/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB not/RB the/DT same/JJ anymore/NN ./.
They/PRP used/VBD to/TO serve/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT sauce/NN and/CC now/RB the/DT sauce/JJ comes/NN served/VBN on/IN the/DT side/NN ,/, just/RB does/VBZ n't/RB taste/VB as/IN flavorful/JJ ./.
But/CC aside/NN from/IN that/DT ,/, this/DT will/MD always/RB be/VB my/VBN go-to/NN place/NN !/.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP concerned/VBN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS in/IN the/DT west/JJS valley/NN ./.
Generous/NNP portions/NNS and/CC quality/NN meats/NNS ./.
The/DT cheese/NN puffs/VBZ and/CC spring/NN rolls/NNS are/VBP crisp/NN and/CC very/RB good/JJ ,/, none/NN of/IN that/DT have/VBP n't/RB changed/VBN the/DT dryer/NN oil/NN in/IN 2/CD weeks/NNS taste/VBP ./.
Chai/NNP boba/NN tea/NN !/.
Well/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ awesome/JJ ./.
Highly/RB recommended/VBD ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT serviceable/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB exciting/VBG ,/, Americanized/VBN Chinese/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ about/IN the/DT best/JJS you/PRP can/MD do/VB for/IN Chinese/JJ food/NN in/IN the/DT Avondale/Goodyear/JJ area/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT orange/NN chicken/NN meal/NN ,/, the/DT Mongolian/NNP beef/NN meal/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT small/JJ hot/NN and/CC sour/JJ soup/NN ./.
The/DT meals/NNS seem/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ deal/NN to/TO add/VB several/JJ extras/NNS to/TO an/DT entrée/NN for/IN only/RB a/DT dollar/NN or/CC so/RB ./.
Choosing/NNP the/DT meal/NN upgrade/NN trades/NNS out/IN your/PRP$ white/JJ rice/NN from/IN the/DT standard/JJ entrée/NN for/IN some/DT lo/NN mein/NN noodles/NNS and/CC some/DT fried/JJ rice/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB a/DT single/JJ vegetable/JJ eggroll/NN and/CC a/DT single/JJ fried/JJ cheese/NN puff/NN ./.
These/DT extras/NNS add/VBP volume/NN and/CC variety/NN to/TO your/PRP$ meal/NN without/IN being/VBG particularly/RB interesting/JJ or/CC delicious/JJ ./.
From/NNP a/DT food-volume-for-price/JJ perspective/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ deal/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP should/MD n't/RB expect/VB any/DT of/IN the/DT extras/NNS to/TO be/VB special/JJ ./.
The/DT eggroll/NN in/IN particular/JJ was/VBD extremely/RB subpar/JJ ,/, As/IN it/PRP reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN an/DT eggroll/NN I/PRP could/MD have/VB bought/VBN frozen/NN and/CC cooked/VBD at/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ home/NN ./.
The/DT cheese/NN puff/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ,/, but/CC then/RB again/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO screw/VB up/RP fried/VBN dough/NN with/IN a/DT lump/NN of/IN cream/NN cheese/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN ./.
The/DT ``/`` fried/JJ rice/NN ''/'' really/RB looks/VBZ to/TO be/VB nothing/NN more/RBR then/RB some/DT rice/NN which/WDT was/VBD made/VBN brown/NN by/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN unremarkable/JJ sauce/NN ./.
The/DT lo/NN mein/NN was/VBD similarly/RB disappointing/JJ ,/, there/EX was/VBD very/RB little/JJ to/TO it/PRP other/JJ than/IN noodles/NNS and/CC some/DT sauce/NN ,/, although/IN the/DT sauce/NN did/VBD add/VB a/DT nice/JJ flavor/NN ./.
The/DT hot/NN and/CC sour/JJ soup/NN was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT high/JJ points/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT broth/NN was/VBD a/DT deep/NN rich/NN brown/VBN with/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN thickness/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, it/PRP had/VBD a/DT generous/JJ amounts/NN of/IN tofu/NN cabbage/NN mushrooms/NNS etc/NN ./.
and/CC the/DT hot/NN and/CC sour/JJ flavors/NNS were/VBD nicely/RB balanced/VBN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN 's/POS orange/NN chicken/NN was/VBD tasty/JJ ,/, but/CC literally/RB included/VBD nothing/NN other/JJ than/IN the/DT chicken/NN and/CC the/DT sauce/NN ./.
It/PRP did/VBD not/RB even/RB include/VB the/DT standard/JJ steamed/JJ broccoli/NN to/TO add/VB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN vegetable/JJ into/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD n't/RB even/RB the/DT pretense/NN of/IN adding/VBG something/NN healthy/JJ here/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT vegetables/NNS were/VBD sorely/RB missed/VBN ./.
The/DT Mongolian/NNP beef/NN was/VBD quite/JJ delicious/JJ but/CC similarly/RB unhealthy/JJ ./.
It/PRP consisted/VBD of/IN reasonably/RB tender/JJ chunks/NNS of/IN beef/NN extremely/RB large/JJ amount/NN of/IN sauce/NN ,/, and/CC green/JJ onions/NNS along/IN with/IN slices/NNS of/IN regular/JJ onion/NN which/WDT had/VBD been/VBN stirfried/VBN with/IN the/DT beef/NN ./.
From/NNP my/VBD experience/NN this/DT is/VBZ pretty/RB much/JJ par/NN for/IN the/DT course/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Mongolian/NNP beef/NN ./.
My/NNP biggest/VBD complaint/NN about/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD the/DT lack/NN of/IN variety/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD probably/RB only/RB about/IN 10/CD different/JJ beef/NN dishes/NNS ,/, a/DT handful/NN of/IN vegetable/JJ dishes/NNS ,/, seven/CD or/CC eight/VB seafood/NN dishes/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT same/JJ number/NN of/IN chicken/NN dishes/NNS ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB find/VB a/DT single/JJ item/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN with/IN eggplant/JJ in/IN it/PRP ./.
What/WP kind/NN of/IN a/DT Chinese/JJ restaurant/NN does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB eggplant/JJ and/CC beef/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ?/.
There/EX were/VBD a/DT handful/JJ of/IN Chinese/Thai/NNP offerings/NNS ,/, but/CC as/IN someone/NN who/WP greatly/RB enjoys/VBZ Thai/NNP food/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD never/RB risk/VB ordering/VBG even/RB a/DT simple/NN curry/NN from/IN a/DT restaurant/NN like/IN this/DT ./.
So/RB long/RB as/IN you/PRP 're/VBP expecting/VBG cheap/NN Americanized/VBN Chinese/JJ food/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD get/VB what/WP you/PRP pay/VBP for/IN ./.
I/PRP can/MD see/VB us/PRP returning/NN to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN for/IN that/DT purpose/NN at/IN some/DT point/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB often/RB ./.
Make/NNP sure/VBD what/WP you/PRP like/IN to/TO order/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT menu/NN before/IN going/NN ,/, because/IN even/RB certain/JJ standard/JJ offerings/NNS maybe/NN missing/NN ./.
