An/DT honest/JJS review/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN :/: it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB bad/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT gyro/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/ok/NN ./.
Too/NNP much/RB meat/NN ,/, could/MD use/VB a/DT little/JJ more/NN sauce/NN ,/, but/CC overall/JJ it/PRP was/VBD not/RB bad/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB getting/VBG to/TO the/DT bad/JJ part/NN ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ordered/VBD the/DT tabouli/NN salad/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD 90/CD %/NN parsley/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB ,/, very/RB bitter/JJ ./.

Took/NNP it/PRP back/RB to/TO the/DT counter/NN and/CC the/DT man/NN ,/, who/WP was/VBD *very*/-NONE- nice/NN and/CC accommodating/NN ,/, agreed/VBD to/TO refund/NN our/NNS money/NN or/CC give/VB her/PRP something/NN else/RB ./.
So/IN the/DT man/NN brought/VBD us/PRP samples/NNS of/IN hummus/NNS and/CC baba/NN ganoush/NN ./.
The/DT hummus/NN tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT dirty/JJ dish/JJ rag/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB trying/VBG to/TO be/VB funny/JJ ./.
My/NNP guess/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP cleaned/VBD the/DT bowl/NN they/PRP made/VBD it/PRP in/IN with/IN dirty/JJ rags/NNS and/CC thus/RB imparted/VBD a/DT mildew/NN taste/NN and/CC smell/NN ./.
The/DT texture/NN was/VBD not/RB like/IN any/DT hummus/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN before/RB ,/, more/RBR like/IN mayonnaise/NN with/IN no/DT tahini/NN or/CC lemon/NN taste/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
Just/NNP awful/JJ ./.
The/DT baba/NN ganoush/NN was/VBD no/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT hummus/NN ./.
We/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP was/VBD simply/RB hummus/JJ mixed/VBN with/IN a/DT little/JJ boiled/JJ eggplant/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB has/VBZ the/DT same/JJ dirty/NN dish/VB rag/JJ taste/NN and/CC smell/NN as/IN the/DT hummus/NN ./.

As/IN for/IN atmosphere/RB ,/, well/RB there/EX is/VBZ n't/RB one/CD ./.
Semi-clean/JJ ,/, semi-dirty/JJ ,/, dark/JJ ,/, with/IN no/DT decorations/NNS except/IN for/IN some/DT gyro/NN posters/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB trying/VBG to/TO be/VB mean/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ akin/JJ to/TO something/NN you/PRP would/MD find/VB in/IN Glendale/NNP ,/, not/RB Scottsdale/NNP ./.

Well/NNP the/DT man/NN that/IN helped/JJ us/NN was/VBD very/RB pleasant/JJ and/CC refunded/VBD our/JJ money/NN ,/, plus/VBZ the/DT gyro/NN was/VBD not/RB bad/JJ ./.
01/05/13/CD 2.5/CD stars/NNS ./.

Since/IN steak/NN was/VBD not/RB an/DT option/NN tonight/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD for/IN a/DT la/NN carte/NN items/NNS of/IN chicken/NN pita/NN (/VBD $/$ 7.95/CD )/CD ,/, regular/JJ hummus/NN (/VBD $/$ 4.50/CD or/CC $/$ 4.95/CD )/CD ,/, and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN falafel/NN balls/NNS (/VBD $/$ 1/CD for/IN two/CD pieces/NNS )/RB ./.

The/DT hummus/NN was/VBD the/DT only/RB one/CD that/WDT was/VBD pre-prepared/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP came/VBD with/IN ONE/NNP olive/JJ ./.
A/DT rather/NN tasty/NN olive/JJ at/IN that/IN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT pity/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD all/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ lonesome/JJ ,/, since/IN the/DT bite/NN that/IN included/JJ it/PRP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ time/NN I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT hummus/NN was/VBD worthwhile/JJ .../:

For/IN only/RB 50/CD cents/NNS more/RBR I/PRP got/VBD a/DT huge/JJ soft/NN pita/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
-/JJ Falafal/NN :/: Really/RB good/JJ ./.
Most/JJS restaurant/NN 's/POS falafal/JJ balls/NNS are/VBP dry/JJ and/CC plain/NN tasting/NN ,/, so/IN I/PRP was/VBD very/RB pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN that/IN these/DT were/VBD moist/RB ,/, fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC quite/JJ flavorful/JJ ./.

Should/NNP have/VBP been/VBN 5/JJ stars/NNS ,/, but/CC let/VB me/PRP explain/VB :/: On/IN a/DT girls-only/JJ trip/NN ,/, a/DT friend/NN of/IN mine/NN and/CC I/PRP visited/VBD Scottsdale/NNP ,/, AZ/NNP over/IN Labor/NNP Day/NNP weekend/NN and/CC decided/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN out/IN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP split/VB the/DT Fattoush/NNP (/NNP Mediterranian/NNP )/NNP Salad/NNP and/CC thought/NNP we/PRP 'd/MD died/VB and/CC gone/NN to/TO Heaven/NNP !/.
There/EX was/VBD so/RB much/RB of/IN it/PRP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO save/JJ 1/2/CD of/IN it/PRP for/IN the/DT next/JJ day/NN 's/POS lunch/NN ./.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN on/IN Sunday/NNP ,/, we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO go/VB back/RB and/CC get/VB another/DT couple/NN of/IN salads/NNS (/VBG YES/NNS ,/, IT/NNP WAS/NNP THAT/NNP GOOD/NNP !/NNP )/.

We/PRP knew/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB closed/VBN on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, so/IN we/PRP Googled/VBD the/DT website/JJ to/TO find/VB out/RP what/WP the/DT hours/NNS were/VBD on/IN Sunday/NNP (/NNP they/PRP close/VBP at/IN 6pm/CD )/NN and/CC we/PRP actually/RB left/VBD the/DT swimming/VBG pool/NN early/RB so/RB that/IN we/PRP could/MD be/VB at/IN the/DT restaurant/NN by/IN 5:15/CD pm/NN (/NN in/IN case/NN they/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO close/VB a/DT little/JJ early/NN since/IN the/DT next/JJ day/NN was/VBD a/DT holiday/NN )/NN ./.
Guess/NNP what/NNP ?/.
They/PRP were/VBD CLOSED/NNP !/.
The/DT sign/NN on/IN the/DT door/NN said/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD closed/VBN on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, 9/3/CD -/JJ nothing/NN about/IN closing/JJ early/NNS on/IN Sunday/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP even/RB checked/VBD the/DT hours/NNS of/IN operation/NN sign/NN to/TO the/DT right/NN of/IN the/DT door/NN to/TO make/VB sure/JJ their/PRP$ closing/JJ hour/NN was/VBD 6pm/CD on/IN Sunday/NNP ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB just/RB miss/VB out/RP on/IN me/NNS and/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN ,/, we/PRP watched/VBD 2/CD other/JJ cars/NNS with/IN people/NNS walk/VBP up/RP to/TO the/DT door/NN and/CC do/VB the/DT same/JJ thing/NN we/PRP did/VBD (/RB pull/VB on/IN door/NN ,/, read/NNP sign/NNP ,/, look/NN at/IN hours/NNS of/IN operation/NN sign/NN to/TO the/DT right/NN of/IN door/NN ,/, look/NN at/IN watch/NNP ,/, lean/NN into/IN glass/NN with/IN hands/NNS cupped/VBD around/IN eyes/NNS to/TO see/VB if/IN someone/NN was/VBD hiding/VBG inside/NN ,/, pull/NN door/NN handle/NN one/CD more/JJR time/NN ,/, shake/NN heads/NNS and/CC walk/NN back/RB to/TO car/NN ./. )/''
SO/NNP DISAPPOINTED/NNP !/.
Had/NNP they/PRP been/VBN open/JJ at/IN 5:15pm/CD on/IN Sunday/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN them/PRP 5/JJ stars/NNS ./.
Hopefully/RB they/PRP 'll/MD still/RB be/VB there/RB next/JJ year/NN when/WRB we/PRP go/VBP back/RB to/TO Scottsdale/NNP !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP buying/VBG a/DT week/NN 's/POS worth/NN of/IN food/NN ,/, in/IN case/NN they/PRP decide/VBP to/TO close/JJ early/JJ without/IN notice/NN again/RB !/.
We/PRP went/VBD here/RB a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD definitly/RB impressed/VBN !/.
This/DT local/JJ guy/NN sure/NN does/VBZ know/VB his/PRP$ food/NN !/.
GREAT/NNP FLAVOR/NNP ,/, huge/JJ portions/NNS ,/, reasonably/RB priced/RB ./.
One/CD small/JJ nit-the/JJ onion/NN slices/NNS are/VBP huge/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN that/DT ./.
But/CC I/PRP recommend/VBP you/PRP try/VBD him/PRP out/IN ./.
What/WP a/DT nice/JJ place/NN !/.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG and/CC the/DT people/NNS are/VBP so/RB very/RB friendly/RB ./.
The/DT menu/NN offers/VBZ a/DT very/RB wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN the/DT usual/JJ middle/NN eastern/JJ flare/NN ./.
They/PRP even/RB offer/VBP vegan/JJ dishes/NNS !/.
I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP the/DT grilled/JJ veggies/NNS with/IN hummus/NNS ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP VERY/NNP reasonable/JJ and/CC the/DT portion/NN sizes/NNS are/VBP quite/JJ large/JJ ./.
I/PRP am/VBP a/DT large/JJ eater/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP never/RB walked/VBN away/RB hungry/JJ ./.
Therefore/NNP ,/, without/IN hesitation/NN I/PRP can/MD say/VB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/VB !/.
Love/NNP hummus/NN ,/, falafel/NN ,/, gyros/NNS and/CC the/DT like/NN ?/.
Come/NNP here/RB !/.
You/PRP can/MD taste/VB the/DT freshness/NN ./.
Pita/NNP Jungle/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ much/RB ,/, much/RB better/JJR ./.
Come/NNP here/RB to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ Greek/NNP food/NN fix/NN ,/, especially/RB if/IN you/PRP live/work/VBP nearby/JJ in/IN Scottsdale/NNP Ranch/NNP or/CC by/IN the/DT hospital/NN ./.
Despite/IN being/VBG hidden/VBN in/IN strip/JJ mall/NN by/IN Quizno/NNP 's/POS ,/, Starbucks/NNP and/CC Chipotle/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ gem/NN ./.
Good/NNP service/NN too/RB ./.
Support/NNP small/JJ business/NN in/IN Scottsdale/NNP ./.
The/DT chicken/NN here/RB is/VBZ better/RBR quality/JJ than/IN most/JJS ./.
It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB marinated/VBN in/IN something/NN yellow/NN ,/, but/CC was/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC reheated/VBN on/IN the/DT grill/NN before/IN entering/VBG my/NNS open/JJ pita/NN for/IN the/DT Chicken/NNP Pita/NNP ./.
Good/NNP dose/NN of/IN Tzaztki/NNP sauce/NN and/CC I/PRP added/VBD 50/CD cents/NNS for/IN feta/NN cheese/NN (/NN which/WDT should/MD be/VB included/VBN )/-NONE- ./.
Otherwise/RB ,/, it/PRP had/VBD all/VBN the/DT regular/JJ stuff/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT chicken/NN made/VBD the/DT difference/NN in/IN sandwich/JJ star/NN quality/NN ./.
Only/RB issue/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT sole/JJ lunch/NN special/NN is/VBZ for/IN the/DT GYRO/NNP which/NNP is/VBZ normally/RB $/$ 5.95/CD ./.
My/NNP pita/NN only/RB costs/VBD $/$ 6.25/CD ,/, but/CC owner/NN gives/VBZ you/PRP drink/VBP and/CC fries/NNS for/IN about/RB a/DT buck/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN 3/NN bucks/NNS ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ why/NN chicken/NN and/CC any/DT pita/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB on/IN special/JJ for/IN lunch/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ infuriating.l/NN Respect/VB the/DT chicken/NN !/.
Taste/NNP of/IN Greek/NNP is/VBZ exceptional/JJ !/.
We/PRP come/VBP here/RB at/IN least/JJS twice/NN a/DT week/NN because/IN we/PRP like/IN the/DT food/NN so/RB much/RB ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP order/JJ chicken/NN gyro/NN and/CC sometimes/RB pita/NN with/IN hummus/NNS ./.

I/PRP work/VBP next/JJ to/TO another/DT gyro/NN place/NN ,/, but/CC after/IN work/NN I/PRP make/VBP the/DT drive/JJ to/TO this/DT one/CD instead/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT craving/NN for/IN Gyros/NNP and/CC I/PRP found/VBD a/DT store/NN that/WDT serves/VBZ the/DT food/NN as/IN a/DT main/JJ dish/NN and/CC not/RB something/VB hidden/JJ in/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.

Food/NNP is/VBZ always/RB excellent/JJ ,/, never/RB had/VBD a/DT complaint/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ pricey/NN though/IN considering/NN that/IN other/JJ Greek/NNP restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT neighboring/VBG towns/NNS will/MD offer/VB $/$ 6/CD for/IN the/DT same/JJ meal/NN ./.
Usually/RB my/VBD bill/NN goes/VBZ very/RB close/JJ to/TO $/$ 10/CD -/-NONE- $/$ 11/CD ./.
Other/JJ than/IN that/DT ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT solid/JJ place/NN to/TO get/VB some/DT Greek/NNP food/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ skeptical/JJ at/IN first/JJ to/TO try/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN considering/VBG tg/NN e/NN first/JJ time/NN we/PRP went/VBD there/RB the/DT power/NN was/VBD out/RP so/IN they/PRP were/VBD closed/VBN ./.
The/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP came/VBD was/VBD during/IN the/DT lunch/NN rush/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP had/VBD it/PRP pretty/RB under/IN control/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/VB ,/, was/VBD the/DT way/NN the/DT tables/NNS were/VBD set/VBN up/RP ./.
Not/RB very/RB much/JJ room/NN for/IN a/DT party/NN greater/JJR than/IN two/CD ./.
And/CC also/RB ,/, the/DT table/JJ was/VBD sticky/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD tasty/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT gyro/NN special/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB fresh/JJ &/CC tasteful/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB hot/JJ though/IN (/NNP not/RB complaining/VBG !/RB !/RB )/.
so/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB about/IN 10/CD min/NN to/TO eat/VB it/PRP ./.
Definitely/RB would/MD recommend/VB and/CC go/VB again/RB ./.
My/NNP girlfriend/VBD just/RB had/VBD her/PRP nails/VBZ done/NN in/IN the/DT same/JJ center/NN ./.
We/PRP walked/VBD by/IN and/CC ordered/VBD a/DT few/JJ Gyros/NNP to-go/NN ./.

These/DT were/VBD awful/JJ ./.
Now/RB I/PRP know/VBP why/JJ they/PRP were/VBD not/RB busy/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
Ehhh/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT hummus/NN snob/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP still/RB determined/VBN to/TO find/VB a/DT hummus/NN spot/NN ./.
They/PRP put/VBD too/RB much/RB garlic/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ hummus/NNS and/CC the/DT falafels/NNS are/VBP just/RB okay/JJ ./.
If/IN I/PRP were/VBD judging/VBG visual/JJ appeal/NN and/CC ambiance/NN I/PRP 'd/MD be/VB hard/JJ pressed/JJ to/TO award/NN Taste/NN of/IN Greek/NNP even/RB a/DT single/JJ star/NN ./.
Thankfully/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT delicious/JJ food/NN and/CC speedy/NN service/NN here/RB earn/VB a/DT solid/JJ four/CD stars/NNS ./.
The/DT ingredients/NNS are/VBP fresh/JJ and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ served/VBN hot/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS are/VBP always/RB perfectly/RB crispy/JJ without/IN being/VBG burnt/NN ./.

The/DT servings/NNS sizes/NNS are/VBP generous/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT gyro/NN special/NN is/VBZ a/DT killer/NN deal/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD very/RB flavorful/JJ but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB recommend/VB getting/VB it/PRP to-go/NN ./.
I/PRP live/VBP about/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS away/RB and/CC by/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP got/VBD home/NN the/DT pita/NN bread/NN was/VBD completely/RB soggy/JJ and/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB enjoy/VB half/DT of/IN the/DT fries/NNS for/IN the/DT same/JJ reason/NN ./.
