I/PRP assume/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN In/IN and/CC out/IN burger/NN is/VBZ but/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB like/IN to/TO wait/NN for/IN a/DT burger/NN then/RB have/VBP to/TO scan/VB the/DT room/NN for/IN a/DT dirty/JJ table/JJ that/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO wipe/VB down/RP myself/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP digress/VBP ./.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP a/DT standard/JJ burger/NN and/CC fries/VBZ that/IN 'll/NN curb/NN your/PRP$ appetite/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN is/VBZ always/RB the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB to/TO ./.

Right/NNP off/VBD the/DT freeway/NN ;/: you/PRP can/MD go/VB off/RP the/DT freeway/NN ,/, grab/NN your/NN food/NN ,/, and/CC go/VB back/RB on/IN ./.
Con/NNP 's/POS :/: 1/CD ./.
Good/NNP luck/NN finding/VBG a/DT seat/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ but/CC they/PRP never/RB have/VBP enough/VBN help/NN at/IN this/DT location/NN ./.
The/DT lines/NNS are/VBP always/RB too/RB long/RB and/CC the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ often/RB not/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO speak/VB up/RP and/CC clean/JJ up/NNS ./.
Typical/JJ In/NNS and/CC Out/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB eat/VB red/VBN meat/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO give/VB it/PRP 5/-NONE- stars/VBZ !/.
Love/NNP their/VBD grilled/JJ cheese/NN with/IN onions/NNS ,/, fries/NNS ,/, and/CC either/VBD a/DT strawberry/JJ shake/NN or/CC iced/VBN tea/NN ./.
Low/NNP prices/NNS ,/, fresh/JJ food/NN ,/, and/CC friendly/RB employees/NNS ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ fast/NN food/NN place/NN !/.
Parking/NNP lot/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT bit/NN challenging/NN and/CC always/RB crowded/VBD ./.
There/EX is/VBZ another/DT location/NN at/IN the/DT 101/CD and/CC Camelback/NNP that/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB too/RB far/RB away/RB ,/, but/CC not/RB nearly/RB as/RB crowded/JJ ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB expecting/VBG the/DT best/JJS burger/NN ever../NN hailing/NN from/IN Chicago/NNP ,/, that/IN would/MD be/VB a/DT tall/JJ task/NN ,/, being/VBG that/IN we/PRP have/VBP so/RB many/JJ great/JJ burger/NN joints/NNS ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP was/VBD too/RB much/JJ hype../NN maybe/NN I/PRP expected/VBD a/DT high/JJ end/NN burger../NN
I/PRP came/VBD away/RB with/IN a/DT very/RB good/JJ impression/NN nonetheless/NN ./.
The/DT burger/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ ,/, great/JJ bun/NN to/TO meat/NN ratio/NN ,/, good/JJ toppings/NNS and/CC great/JJ value/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD alright/RB ,/, kinda/NN soggy/NN and/CC a/DT bit/NN underwhelming/NN ,/, even/RB with/IN animal/JJ style/NN toppings/NNS ./.
4/IN stars../NN great/JJ fast/NN food/NN burger/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS chain/NN burgers/NNS I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN ./.
I/PRP realized/VBD quickly/RB this/DT was/VBD not/RB a/DT high/JJ end/NN joint/NNS but/CC the/DT quality/NN was/VBD definitely/RB comparable/JJ ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD fast/VBN for/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN traffic/NN in/IN and/CC out/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Great/NNP and/CC fast/JJ service/NN ./.
I/PRP really/RB like/IN their/PRP$ Neapolitan/NNP shake/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT good/JJ burger/NN and/CC milkshake-great/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN their/PRP$ fries/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP know/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS who/WP are/VBP ./.
The/DT hidden/JJ menu/NN is/VBZ fun/JJ to/TO try/VB out/RP as/RB well/RB !/.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ always/RB busy/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT good/JJ staff/NN that/WDT speeds/VBZ up/RP the/DT line/NN quickly/RB ./.
I/PRP love/VBP In-N-Out/JJ you/PRP always/RB know/VBP what/WP you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO get/VB ./.
But/CC at/IN this/DT location/NN they/PRP have/VBP one/VBN gal/JJ taking/VBG the/DT orders/NNS that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB know/VB what/WP animal/JJ style/NN is/VBZ ./.

Classic/NNP chain/VBD food/NN place/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP will/MD review/VB on/IN the/DT service/NN because/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ just/RB like/IN most/JJS others/NNS ./.
I/PRP am/VBP greeted/VBN with/IN a/DT smile/NN and/CC like/IN the/DT people/NNS there/RB ./.
but/CC it/PRP should/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ cleaner/NN I/PRP think/VBP ./.
Long/NNP line/NN in/IN the/DT drive/JJ thru/NN (/NN weekend/NN )/NNS but/CC worth/VB the/DT wait/NN !/.
I/PRP ordered/VBP through/IN an/DT employee/NN standing/NN in/IN the/DT drive/JJ thru/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT tablet/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.
Very/NNP friendly/RB ,/, very/RB professional/JJ !/.

I/PRP will/MD give/VB 5/JJ stars/NNS if/IN their/PRP$ french/NN fries/NNS taste/VBP better/JJR than/IN fried/JJ cardboard/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ burgers/NNS are/VBP good/JJ with/IN fresh/JJ lettuce/NN and/CC tomato/NN ,/, better/JJR than/IN Burger/NNP King/NNP ,/, McDonalds/NNP and/CC Jack/NNP in/IN a/DT box/NN ./.
I/PRP sent/VBP my/JJ comment/NN about/IN french/JJ fries/NNS but/CC I/PRP suppose/VBP they/PRP are/VBP not/RB gon/VBN na/NN make/VB better/JJ fries/NNS ./.

My/NNP brother/NN is/VBZ visiting/VBG from/IN Seattle/NNP ,/, where/WRB apparently/RB they/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB In/IN 'n/JJ '/NN Out/IN Burgers/NNP !/.

The/DT menu/NN could/MD not/RB be/VB simpler/JJ ,/, and/CC for/IN once/RB ,/, a/DT fast-food/NN burger/NN looks/NNS like/IN what/WP 's/POS advertised/VBN ./.
