I/PRP attend/VBP the/DT Saturday/NNP Afternoon/NNP (/NNP 5-8/CD )/NN Blues/NNS and/CC roots/NNS sessions/NNS quite/RB often/RB ./.
Always/NNP find/VBD a/DT few/JJ faces/NNS I/PRP know/VBP in/IN the/DT crowd/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP super/NN surprised/VBD to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT very/RB few/JJ 2/CD star/NN reviews/VBZ for/IN this/DT place/NN .../: As/IN a/DT place/NN to/TO grab/NN drinks/NNS and/CC listen/VBN to/TO live/VB music/JJ ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD be/VB willing/JJ to/TO give/VB this/DT place/NN a/DT 3/NN star/NN but/CC the/DT food/NN and/CC atmosphere/RB were/VBD not/RB the/DT best/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT cheese/NN Quesadillas/VBZ (/RP a/DT commonly/RB known/VBN safe/JJ bar/NN food/NN option/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN )/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB small/JJ for/IN $/$ 9/CD price/NN tag/NN that/WDT came/VBD with/IN it/PRP (/VBD three/CD pieces/NNS )/JJ and/CC every/DT ingredient/JJ tasted/VBN like/IN it/PRP came/VBD from/IN a/DT can/MD (/VB think/NN pizza/NN pocket/NN !/NN )/.
My/NNP friends/VBZ ordered/IN the/DT garlic/JJ bread/JJ with/IN cheese/NN and/CC the/DT wings/NNS and/CC again/RB both/DT of/IN them/PRP said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD surprised/VBN about/IN how/WRB bland/JJ the/DT taste/NN was/VBD ./.
My/NNP recommendation/NN is/VBZ eat/JJ before/IN or/CC after/IN coming/VBG here/RB and/CC just/RB come/VBP for/IN the/DT band/NN .../: ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD mediocre/JJ at/IN best/JJS ,/, not/RB to/TO mention/NN far/RB too/RB pricey/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN the/DT burger/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN fries/NNS and/CC a/DT drink/NN ,/, but/CC instead/RB received/VBD a/DT salad/JJ instead/NN of/IN fries/NNS ./.
When/WRB inquiring/VBG about/IN the/DT mix/NN up/IN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD told/VBN ``/`` You/PRP happy/VBP ?/.
No/DT ?/.
You/PRP eat/VBP salad/JJ ''/'' ./.
After/IN being/VBG ignored/VBN for/IN the/DT next/JJ 20/NN minutes/NNS and/CC subsequently/RB eating/VBG the/DT salad/JJ I/PRP was/VBD served/VBN ,/, I/PRP finally/RB managed/VBD to/TO convince/VB the/DT owner/NN to/TO give/VB me/PRP my/VB plate/NN of/IN fries/NNS ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD excruciatingly/RB slow/JJ ,/, though/IN the/DT supposed/VBN ``/`` jazz/NN ''/'' (/IN a/DT single/JJ piano/NN )/NN was/VBD okay/NN ./.
Overall/IN I/PRP give/VBP this/DT restaurant/NN bar/NN a/DT rating/NN of/IN 2/CD stars/NNS ,/, since/IN I/PRP did/VBD eventually/RB receive/VB my/PRP$ fries/NNS ./.
The/DT Gate/NNP has/VBZ good/JJ and/CC bad/JJ points/NNS ,/, but/CC every/DT experience/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN here/RB has/VBZ been/VBN positive/JJ ./.
I/PRP got/VBD ta/NN urge/NN ya/NN to/TO sit/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN ;/: it/PRP 's/VBZ often/RB a/DT rewarding/NN experience/NN ,/, had/VBD a/DT great/JJ conversation/NN every/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT music/NN is/VBZ often/RB excellent/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB the/DT reason/NN you/PRP go/VB ,/, though/IN the/DT placement/NN of/IN the/DT stage/NN does/VBZ n't/RB work/VB well/RB -/JJ it/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB close/JJ to/TO the/DT bar/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO walk/NN between/IN the/DT bar/NN and/CC the/DT larger/NN tables/NNS in/IN the/DT back/NN ./.
Frankly/NNP it/PRP gets/VBZ inordinately/RB loud/NN ,/, so/RB beware/RB ./.
Beer/NN prices/NNS are/VBP excellent/JJ (/NN usually/RB $/$ 2/CD below/IN the/DT Local/NNP across/IN the/DT street/NN )/NN and/CC they/PRP know/VBP how/WRB to/TO mix/NN drinks/VBZ -/JJ most/JJS of/IN the/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP there/RB for/IN music/JJ ,/, company/NN ,/, and/CC drinks/VBZ ,/, so/RB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB ./.
Very/NNP disappointed/VBD in/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD incredibly/RB bad/JJ and/CC way/NN too/RB expensive/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN we/PRP got/VBD ./.
Definitely/RB not/RB going/VB back/RB again/RB ./.
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP night/NN for/IN a/DT live/JJ jazz/NN performance/NN and/CC casual/JJ drinks/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB too/RB busy/JJ so/IN there/EX was/VBD plenty/NN of/IN seating/NN ./.
The/DT jazz/NN band/NN was/VBD situated/VBN right/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN so/IN you/PRP could/MD sit/VB infront/NN or/CC behind/IN the/DT band/NN ./.
No/DT cover/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT band/NN but/CC they/PRP pass/VBP around/IN a/DT tip/NN jar/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC quick/RB ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT good/JJ selection/NN of/IN beers/NNS on/IN tap/NN with/IN pints/NNS ranging/VBG between/IN $/$ 5-8/CD ,/, fancy/NN coctails/NNS priced/VBN at/IN $/$ 8.50/CD and/CC house/CD wine/NN for/IN $/$ 5/glass/CD ./.
Food/NNP menu/NN has/VBZ the/DT basic/JJ pub/NN food/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ entrees/NNS ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN I/PRP would/MD come/VB specifically/RB to/TO have/VB a/DT meal/NN but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT option/NN if/IN we/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN snacks/NNS like/IN nachos/NNS ,/, fries/NNS or/CC wings/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN stopping/VBG in/IN here/NNP for/IN an/DT after/NN work/NN drink/VBP quite/JJ frequently/NN of/IN late/JJ ./.

A/DT lovely/RB evening/VBG out/RP ./.
I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB reservations/NNS .../: particularly/RB since/IN visibility/NN to/TO the/DT live/NN acts/NNS is/VBZ limited/VBN ./.

Perhaps/NNP the/DT owners/NNS are/VBP from/IN out/IN West/NNP ?/.

The/DT venue/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ small/JJ for/IN everyone/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT performers/NNS but/CC the/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ intimate/JJ and/CC homey/NN !/.

Toronto/NNP is/VBZ lucky/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT hidden/VBN gem/NN like/IN Gate/NNP 403/CD :/: )/.
While/IN I/PRP think/VBP that/IN ,/, overall/JJ ,/, Gate/NNP 403/CD is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ bar/NN ,/, the/DT above/NNP four/CD stars/NNS is/VBZ not/RB for/IN the/DT bar/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN the/DT bar/NN on/IN Tuesday/NNP Nights/NNP ./.
