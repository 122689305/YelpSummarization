Finally/RB decided/VBD to/TO see/VB what/WP all/PDT the/DT hype/NN was/VBD about/RB and/CC ended/VBD up/RP pretty/RB disappointed/JJ ./.
First/NN of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP love/VBP hole/JJ in/IN wall/JJ restaurants/NNS ./.
I/PRP can/MD tolerate/VB a/DT lot/NN if/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ worth/IN it/PRP but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ this/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ just/RB filthy/JJ and/CC unkept/JJ ./.
Service/NN ,/, while/IN friendly/RB ,/, is/VBZ totally/RB unorganized/JJ and/CC slow/JJ ./.
I/PRP noticed/VBD a/DT cook/NN walking/NN around/IN the/DT kitchen/NN in/IN socks/NNS ¯\_/VBG (/NN ツ/NNS )/VBP _/¯/RB The/DT dining/JJ room/NN is/VBZ a/DT disaster/NN ./.
Again/NNP ,/, filthy/JJ with/IN no/DT ac/NN or/CC airflow/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN ribs/NNS and/CC pulled/VBD pork/NN so/IN we/PRP tried/VBP the/DT polish/JJ boy/NN and/CC fried/VBN chicken/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC had/VBD been/VBN under/IN the/DT lamps/NNS for/IN too/RB long/RB and/CC the/DT Polish/NNP boy/NN was/VBD just/RB some/DT BBQ/NNP sauced/VBD slop/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP wanted/JJ to/TO like/IN this/DT place/NN but/CC if/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB want/VB to/TO pretend/NN like/IN they/PRP care/VBP about/IN cleanliness/NN or/CC food/NN quality/NN and/CC ride/NN that/IN tv/NN hype/NN I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/RB ./.
Not/RB at/IN all/DT impressed/VBN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB worth/VB the/DT hype/NN surrounding/VBG this/DT place/NN ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN the/DT best/JJS thing/NN that/IN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD the/DT coleslaw/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB coleslaw/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB terrible/JJ by/IN any/DT means/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT ribs/NNS were/VBD not/RB nearly/RB as/RB tender/JJ as/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB for/IN a/DT place/NN that/WDT is/VBZ ``/`` famous/JJ ''/'' for/IN them/PRP ./.
I/PRP grew/VBD up/RP and/CC Cleveland/NNP ,/, and/CC somehow/VB never/RB tried/IN it/PRP ,/, always/RB thinking/IN I/PRP could/MD go/VB later/JJ ,/, and/CC when/WRB I/PRP found/VBD i/NN was/VBD moving/VBG ,/, I/PRP was/VBD worried/VBN when/WRB I/PRP went/VBD there/RB I/PRP would/MD love/VB it/PRP ,/, and/CC hate/VB myself/NN for/IN not/RB going/VBG there/RB all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.
Luckily/NNP I/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ ,/, and/CC have/VBP had/VBN better/VBN ribs/NNS all/DT over/IN the/DT country/NN ./.
My/NNP first/JJ stop/NN when/WRB I/PRP got/VBD to/TO Cleveland/NNP was/VBD at/IN Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP ,/, restaurant/VBD on/IN Cleveland/NNP 's/POS East/NNP Side/NNP ,/, which/WDT features/NNS a/DT variation/NN on/IN a/DT polish/JJ boy/NN that/WDT includes/VBZ the/DT addition/NN of/IN smoked/JJ and/CC barbecued/VBD pork/NN shoulder/NN to/TO the/DT sandwich/JJ ,/, was/VBD featured/VBN in/IN June/NNP 2010/CD on/IN the/DT Travel/NNP Channel/NNP 's/POS Man/NNP vs./NN Food/NNP ./.
Host/NNP and/CC food/NNP enthusiast/NN Adam/NNP Richman/NNP tried/NNP their/PRP$ Polish/JJ boy/NN ,/, which/WDT featured/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN 's/POS signature/NN hot-sauce/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ divey/NN ./.
The/DT neighborhood/NN questionable/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD a/DT homeless/JJ man/NN out/IN front/JJ asking/NN every/DT one/NN for/IN money/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB feel/VB unsafe/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT ladies/NNS were/VBD really/RB helpful/JJ ./.
Being/VBG from/IN the/DT Midwest/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB all/PDT the/DT menu/NN options/NNS and/CC they/PRP were/VBD quick/JJ to/TO explain/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP looked/VBD around/IN the/DT bright/NN pink/NN ,/, run/VBD down/IN restaurant/NN ,/, I/PRP saw/VBD quite/RB a/DT mix/NN ./.
A/DT couple/NN young/JJ girls/NNS on/IN lunch/NN break/NN ,/, a/DT small/JJ black/NN family/NN and/CC a/DT cluster/NN of/IN little/JJ old/JJ white/JJ ladies/NNS in/IN another/DT corner/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD strictly/RB for/IN the/DT polish/JJ boy/NN ./.
A/DT big/JJ time/NN foodie/NN I/PRP ALWAYS/NNS have/VBP to/TO try/VB the/DT local/JJ delicacies/NNS ./.
The/DT Polish/NNP Boy/NNP is/VBZ a/DT sausage/NN sandwich/JJ native/JJ to/TO Cleveland/NN ./.
It/PRP consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT link/NN of/IN kielbasa/NN placed/NNS in/IN a/DT bun/NN ,/, and/CC covered/VBD with/IN a/DT layer/NN of/IN french/NN fries/NNS ,/, a/DT layer/NN of/IN barbecue/NN sauce/NN or/CC hot/NN sauce/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT layer/NN of/IN coleslaw/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT sausage/NN is/VBZ typically/RB grilled/JJ ,/, some/DT establishments/NNS will/MD quickly/RB deep/VB fry/JJ the/DT sausage/NN after/IN grilling/NN and/CC prior/RB to/TO assembling/VB the/DT sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, oh/VBP that/IN sauce/NN !/.
It/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ !/NN !/.
After/IN eating/VBG I/PRP headed/VBD out/RP back/RB and/CC talked/VBD to/TO Willie/NNP ,/, who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN manning/VBG the/DT ribs/NNS for/IN 38/CD years/NNS ./.
Give/NNP him/VBD a/DT few/JJ bucks/NNS if/IN you/PRP have/VBP them/PRP !/.
The/DT huge/JJ downfall/NN that/IN this/DT place/NN has/VBZ is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB organized/VBN at/IN all/DT ./.
You/PRP place/VBP your/JJ order/NN and/CC they/PRP ring/VBP you/PRP up/RB ,/, then/RB you/PRP find/VBP out/RP that/IN they/PRP ran/VBD out/IN of/IN what/WP you/PRP ordered/VBP (/RB on/IN this/DT particular/JJ day/NN ,/, they/PRP ran/VBD out/IN of/IN hot/NN sauce/NN and/CC chicken/NN wings/NNS )/NN ./.
You/PRP then/RB have/VBP the/DT cashier/NN shouting/VBG the/DT orders/NNS ./.
You/PRP are/VBP done/VBN right/RB ,/, just/RB wait/VBP for/IN your/PRP$ food/NN to/TO be/VB called/VBN ?/.
No/DT ./.
You/PRP constantly/RB repeat/VBP what/WP you/PRP ordered/VBP to/TO the/DT person/NN actually/RB making/VBG your/PRP$ food/NN and/CC then/RB they/PRP ask/VBP the/DT cashier/NN again/RB to/TO make/VB sure/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB my/PRP$ order/NN ?/.
Am/NNP I/PRP trying/VBG to/TO get/VB more/JJR food/NN then/RB what/WP I/PRP paid/VBP for/IN ?/.
Why/NN did/VBD n't/RB you/VB ask/VB the/DT cashier/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ?/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/RB this/DT place/NN gets/NNS so/RB much/RB hype/VB ./.
Maybe/NNP its/NNP because/IN the/DT midwesterners/NNS do/VBP n't/RB experience/VB great/JJ barbecue/NN but/CC this/DT is/VBZ average/JJ compared/VBN to/TO the/DT barbecue/NN in/IN Memphis/NNP ./.
Not/RB worth/IN the/DT drive/JJ unless/NN you/PRP are/VBP dying/VBG for/IN barbecue/NN ./.
Just/NNP writing/NN this/DT makes/NN me/VBD want/CD to/TO drive/VB 12/CD hours/NNS to/TO Memphis/NNP to/TO get/VB some/DT pork/NN shoulder/NN ,/, ribs/NNS ,/, and/CC slaw/NN ./.
Well/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB overrated/VBN ,/, based/VBN on/IN expectations/NNS from/IN various/JJ food/NN shows/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ bad/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Polish/JJ boy/NN combo/NN meal-/NN Polish/NNP boy/NN ,/, fries/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT drink/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB unremarkable/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP pretty/RB sure/JJ they/PRP were/VBD just/RB OreIda/NNP frozen/NN fries/NNS ./.
The/DT Polish/NNP boy/NN was/VBD actually/RB a/DT lot/NN smaller/NN and/CC skimpier/JJR than/IN I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD fasted/VBN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN ,/, so/IN I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ let/NN down/IN ./.
That/DT being/VBG said/VBN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD still/RB plenty/JJ of/IN food/NN and/CC the/DT sauce/JJ really/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG !/.
Seriously/RB ,/, smothering/VBG my/NN sandwich/NN and/CC fries/NNS in/IN the/DT sauce/NN made/VBD up/RP for/IN anything/NN that/IN was/VBD lacking/VBG ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT fancy/NN place/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP liked/VBD that/IN about/IN Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP ./.
In/IN this/DT age/NN of/IN Cleveland/NNP celebrity/NN chefs/NNS and/CC pretentiousness/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ refreshing/VBG to/TO go/VB to/TO a/DT middle/NN class/NN place/NN in/IN a/DT decidedly/RB non-trendy/JJ neighborhood/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP go/JJ back/RB again/RB ,/, just/RB with/IN slightly/RB different/JJ expectations/NNS ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, just/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT hot/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ n't/RB 'all/JJ that/IN '/NNP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD nothing/VBN special/JJ and/CC the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD greasy/JJ ./.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD not/RB at/IN all/DT friendly/JJ or/CC welcoming/VBG ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, and/CC since/IN when/WRB is/VBZ a/DT chicken/NN sandwich/JJ two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN chicken/NN on/IN the/DT bone/NN and/CC two/CD pieces/NNS of/IN bread/JJ ?/.
Take/IN it/PRP off/IN the/DT bone/NN and/CC put/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT bread/JJ yourself/NN ?/.
Want/NNP the/DT hot/NN sauce/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN ?/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT extra/JJ 65/CD cents/NNS ./.
The/DT coleslaw/NN was/VBD okay/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP other/JJ locations/NNS are/VBP better/VBG .../: .../:
Let/NNP me/VBD just/RB apologize/RB to/TO the/DT food/NN gods/VBZ right/NN now/RB for/IN having/NN taken/NNS 20/CD years/NNS of/IN my/JJ life/NN to/TO finally/RB try/VB this/DT hometown/NN legend/NN ./.

We/PRP looked/VBD over/IN it/PRP but/CC found/VBD that/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT items/NNS were/VBD good/JJ for/IN just/RB two/CD people/NNS so/IN we/PRP took/VBD the/DT menu/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT front/NN counter/NN ./.
We/PRP stood/VBD there/RB for/IN about/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS when/WRB finally/RB a/DT worker/NN walked/VBD up/RP to/TO the/DT counter/NN and/CC rudely/RB said/VBD ``/`` What/NNP ?/NNP ``/`` ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD could/MD we/VB get/IN the/DT other/JJ page/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN to/TO which/WDT he/PRP replied/VBD ./.

We/PRP remembered/VBD Uber/JJR existed/VBN and/CC we/PRP caught/VBP an/DT Uber/NN to/TO another/DT restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP can/MD see/VB why/RB this/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT neighborhood/NN hangout/NN :/: Everyone/NNP is/VBZ friendly/RB and/CC seems/VBZ to/TO know/VB each/DT other/JJ ;/: basketball/NN games/NNS on/IN the/DT one/CD TV/NN so/RB this/DT hardly/NN qualifies/VBZ as/IN a/DT sports/NNS bar/NN ;/: and/CC great/JJ food/NN at/IN reasonable/JJ prices/NNS ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Sunday/NNP dinner/NN of/IN brisket/NN with/IN three/CD sides/NNS -/JJ candied/VBN yams/NNS ,/, black/JJ eyed/JJ peas/NNS ,/, and/CC fried/VBD okra/NN -/JJ wonderful/JJ ./.

Gross/NNP food/NN ,/, gross/VBZ atmosphere/RB ,/, rude/NN employees/NNS ./.

It/PRP looked/VBD like/IN a/DT plate/NN of/IN soup/NN with/IN sauce/JJ and/CC coleslaw/NN and/CC soggy/JJ bread/NN ./.
The/DT meat/NN tasted/VBD old/JJ ./.
Dining/VBG room/NN was/VBD atrociously/RB dirty/JJ with/IN a/DT boom/NN box/NN on/IN too/RB loud/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB understand/VB how/WRB this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ a/DT Cleveland/NN staple/NN or/CC how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD on/IN so/RB many/JJ TV/NN shows/NNS ./.
Never/NNP would/MD I/VB go/RB back/RB there/RB ./.

This/DT joint/NN is/VBZ no/DT exception/NN ./.

At/IN least/JJS no/DT public/JJ place/NN that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN yet/RB does/VBZ ./.
Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP is/VBZ kind/NN of/IN overwhelming/NN ./.
A/DT lot/NN of/IN locals/NNS seem/VBP to/TO come/VB here/RB ./.
They/PRP know/VBP what/WP they/PRP want/VBP even/RB before/IN they/PRP arrive/VBP ./.

The/DT typical/JJ dinner/NN will/MD include/VB fried/JJ chicken/ribs/pork.etc/NN ,/, a/DT side/NN of/IN slaw/NN ,/, fries/NNS and/CC bread/JJ ./.

The/DT slaw/NN looked/VBD way/NN too/RB liquidy/NN for/IN my/PRP$ tastes/NNS ,/, so/RB I/PRP upgraded/VBD to/TO the/DT mac/NNP &/CC cheese/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN ,/, smothered/VBD in/IN hot/NN sauce/NN was/VBD bland/JJ ,/, un-crispy/JJ and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN it/PRP was/VBD sitting/VBG around/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD packaged/VBN frozen/JJ cottage/NN fries/NNS (/VBP not/RB fresh/JJ cut/NN )/NN with/IN their/PRP$ signature/NN sauce/NN dumped/VBD on/IN top/NNS ./.
The/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD overcooked/VBN and/CC so/RB tender/RB ,/, it/PRP almost/RB melts/VBZ in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP the/DT potential/NN for/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN cuisine/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB giving/VBG this/DT place/NN any/DT sort/NN of/IN break/NN because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT so/RB called/VBN ``/`` Cleveland/NNP institution/NN ''/'' ./.
Cleveland/NNP deserves/VBZ better/RBR BBQ/NNP ./.
So/IN I/PRP was/VBD really/RB interested/JJ in/IN this/DT place/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT Man/NNP vs/VBZ Food/NNP and/CC other/JJ foodie/NN reviews/NNS and/CC publicity/NN ./.
To/NNS say/VBP that/IN its/PRP$ in/IN an/DT interesting/JJ section/NN of/IN town/NN is/VBZ an/DT understatement/NN ./.
The/DT location/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ rundown/NN and/CC the/DT interior/NN might/MD need/VB a/DT good/JJ scrubbing/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP came/VBD in/IN at/IN 1245p/CD ,/, there/EX was/VBD no/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN ready/NN ,/, no/DT greens/NNS and/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB that/IN they/PRP were/VBD ready/NN to/TO serve/VB customers/NNS for/IN lunch/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD pretty/RB empty/JJ though/IN ./.
I/PRP asked/VBD if/IN they/PRP had/VBD any/DT chicken/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD 6/VBN minutes/NNS until/IN it/PRP was/VBD done/VBN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP wait/NN ./.
Ordered/IN the/DT two/CD piece/NN and/CC mac/cheese/NN and/CC cole/NN slaw/NN ./.
Total/NNP for/IN that/DT was/VBD about/RB $/$ 10/CD ./.
Food/NNP arrived/VBD .../: no/DT frills/NNS ./.
Cole/NNP slaw/NN was/VBD darned/VBN good/JJ ,/, wished/JJ there/NN was/VBD more/RBR ./.
Mac/NNP &/CC cheese/NN was/VBD nothing/JJ special/NN ./.
Chicken/NNP was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Not/RB especially/RB tasty/JJ flour/JJ coating/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT chicken/NN itself/NN was/VBD PERFECTLY/NNP DONE/NNP ./.
Not/RB 1/CD degree/NN too/RB little/RB ,/, not/RB 1/CD degree/NN too/RB much/RB ./.
Melts/NNS in/IN the/DT mouth/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD give/VB it/PRP a/DT 3.5/CD stars/NNS ./.
The/DT decor/NN gets/VBZ one/CD star/NN ./.
But/CC food/NN trumps/NNS decor/VBP .../:
Maybe/NNP Mondays/NNP are/VBP just/RB bad/JJ days/NNS ./.
Went/NNP for/IN the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT breast/NN -/JJ dried/VBD out/RP boneless/JJ breast/NN ;/: a/DT thigh/JJ -/JJ super/NN crunchy/JJ but/CC greasy/JJ beyond/NN belief/NN and/CC so/RB over/IN cooked/VBN that/IN thigh/JJ meat/NN had/VBD receded/VBN it/PRP its/PRP$ hardened/JJ shell/NN ;/: and/CC a/DT wing/NN ,/, also/RB overcooked/VBN and/CC greasy/JJ ./.
The/DT coleslaw/NN was/VBD ok/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB enough/RB to/TO save/VB the/DT day/NN ./.
The/DT candied/VBN yams/NNS tasted/VBN liked/VBD canned/VBN yams/NNS in/IN the/DT liquid/NN they/PRP come/VBP in/IN ./.
Maybe/NNP they/PRP ran/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT butter/NN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB candied/JJ yams/NNS ./.
At/IN least/JJS the/DT coke/NN was/VBD cold/NN ./.
Oh/NNP ,/, I/PRP almost/RB forgot/VBP the/DT sorry/JJ excuse/NN for/IN a/DT corn/NN bread/JJ muffin/NN that/IN it/PRP came/VBD with/IN -dry/JJ ,/, mealy/RB and/CC tasteless/NN ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT worst/NN thing/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/VBN eaten/JJ in/IN Cleveland/NNP ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ better/RBR in/IN Memphis/NNP ./.
Went/NNP for/IN the/DT second/JJ time/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP 7/29/2010/CD ,/, and/CC Danielle/NNP ,/, the/DT completely/RB indifferent/JJ cashier/NN dropped/VBD the/DT ball/NN on/IN my/PRP$ order/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB 40/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB a/DT bloody/NN catfish/JJ sandwich/NN Do/NNP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/VB ,/, fried/VBN catfish/JJ was/VBD outstanding/JJ ,/, but/CC being/VBG treated/VBN like/IN trash/NN will/MD insure/VB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB return/VB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ because/IN I/PRP am/VBP very/RB loyal/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ favorite/JJ eateries/NNS ./.
Below/NNP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ experience/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP heard/JJ good/JJ things/NNS about/IN this/DT place/NN on/IN Yelp/NNP ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD okay/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD actually/RB pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP regret/VBP letting/VBG them/PRP douse/VBP my/JJ chicken/NN and/CC fries/NNS in/IN the/DT bbq/NN sauce/NN though/IN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ something/NN that/IN just/RB does/VBZ n't/RB gel/VB with/IN fried/JJ and/CC bbq/JJ chicken/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP did/VBD enjoy/VB my/PRP$ mostly/NN sugar/NN orange-pineapple/JJ drink/NN ./.
The/DT coldslaw/NN was/VBD boring/VBG ./.
The/DT ambiance/NN was/VBD nice/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT server/NN (/VBD s/NNS )/NNS who/WP took/VBD my/RB take/VB out/RP order/NN could/MD n't/RB have/VB given/VBN two/CD craps/NNS about/IN customer/NN service/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP give/VB it/PRP one/CD more/JJR in/IN the/DT hopes/NN that/IN my/JJ experience/NN will/MD be/VB redeemed/VBN ./.
The/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP relatively/RB quickly/RB though/IN ./.

I/PRP definitely/RB like/IN the/DT food/NN here/RB and/CC everything/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT chicken/NN ,/, the/DT ribs/NNS ,/, the/DT hot/NN links/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT sides/NNS are/VBP delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP particularly/VBP like/IN the/DT po/NN boy/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ something/NN like/IN a/DT hot/NN dog/NN or/CC hot/NN link/NN in/IN a/DT bun/NN ,/, topped/VBD with/IN cole/NN slaw/NN ,/, french/JJ fries/NNS ,/, and/CC covered/VBD in/IN sauce/NN ./.
And/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ around/IN like/IN $/$ 4/CD and/CC some/DT change/NN ./.
For/IN less/JJR than/IN $/$ 5/CD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT value/NN and/CC really/RB good/JJ ./.
If/IN this/DT place/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ closer/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB come/VB by/IN more/JJR often/RB
Best/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN in/IN Cleveland/NNP .../: best/JJS barbecue/NN sauce/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
I/PRP always/VBP take/JJ out-of-town/NN visitors/NNS here/RB and/CC get/VB a/DT bunch/NN of/IN fried/JJ chicken/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
My/NNP friends/NNS and/CC I/PRP come/VBP here/RB every/DT few/JJ months/NNS to/TO clog/NN our/NNS arteries/NNS with/IN the/DT awesomeness/NN that/IN is/VBZ Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP ./.
The/DT fried/VBN breading/NN on/IN the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ so/RB amazing/VBG that/IN I/PRP inhale/VBP it/PRP into/IN my/PRP$ stomach/JJ every/DT time/NN .../: the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ so/RB moist/JJ and/CC tender/JJ that/IN it/PRP melts/VBZ in/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN .../: the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ so/RB flavorful/JJ and/CC unique/JJ that/IN I/PRP put/VBP it/PRP on/IN everything/NN ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, the/DT location/NN is/VBZ ghetto/NN .../: the/DT ambiance/NN is/VBZ ghetto/NN .../: the/DT service/NN can/MD be/VB unreasonably/RB slow/JJ at/IN times/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ what/WP keeps/NNS me/PRP coming/RB and/CC what/WP gives/VBZ HSW/NNP 4/NNP stars/NNS ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, if/IN you/PRP want/VBP legit/NN fried/VBN chicken/NN in/IN Cleveland/NNP ,/, I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP ./.
They/PRP do/VBP not/RB keep/VB the/DT hours/NNS they/PRP advertise/VBP ,/, service/NN is/VBZ rude/NN ,/, food/NN is/VBZ cold/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN shame/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP racist/NN ./.
Just/NNP joking/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN and/CC ribs/VBZ dinner/NN ,/, which/WDT included/VBD a/DT breast/NN and/CC a/DT wing/NN of/IN their/PRP$ unbelievably/JJ crispy/NN and/CC delicious/JJ fried/JJ chicken/NN ,/, two/CD large/JJ ribs/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD tender/VBN and/CC smothered/VBD in/IN tangy/NN bbq/NN sauce/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN and/CC baked/VBD beans/NNS (/IN both/DT great/JJ )/NN ./.
As/IN many/JJ on/IN this/DT site/NN have/VBP written/VBN ,/, the/DT decor/NN and/CC location/NN are/VBP n't/RB the/DT best/NN ,/, but/CC do/VBP n't/RB let/VB that/DT discourage/NN you/PRP ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN southern/JJ style/NN soul/JJ food/NN and/CC in/IN Cleveland/NNP ,/, check/NN out/IN Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP post-haste/NN ./.
Got/NN takeout/NN from/IN here/RB last/JJ night/NN ./.
The/DT good/JJ :/: The/DT Po/NNP Boy/NNP is/VBZ solid/JJ ./.
Very/NNP tasty/NN ,/, as/IN was/VBD the/DT Mac/NNP N/NNP Cheese/NNP The/DT decent/NN :/: Chicken/NNP Sandwich/NNP -/NN Just/NN so/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, as/IN we/PRP learned/VBD ,/, a/DT chicken/NN sandwich/JJ here/RB is/VBZ simply/RB fried/VBN chicken/NN on/IN the/DT bone/NN with/IN two/CD slices/NNS of/IN wonder/NN bread/NN ./.
So/IN hence/NN ,/, not/RB really/RB a/DT chicken/NN sandwich/NN ./.
The/DT skin/NN could/MD have/VB been/VBN crispier/NN ,/, it/PRP seemed/VBD a/DT bit/NN too/RB spongy/JJ ,/, maybe/JJ old/JJ oil/NN ?/.
Not/RB sure/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ./.
The/DT sauce/NN that/IN comes/JJ with/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/JJR of/IN a/DT tomato/NN based/VBN typed/VBD hot/NN sauce/NN ,/, sort/NN of/IN a/DT mix/NN between/IN hot/NN sauce/NN ,/, tomato/NN sauce/NN and/CC bbq/NN sauce/NN which/WDT I/PRP liked/VBD ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ wife/NN did/VBD n't/RB care/VB for/IN ./.
The/DT Green/NNP Beans/NNP were/VBD average/JJ ./.
The/DT bad/NN :/: No/DT sweet/NN tea/NN ,/, the/DT tea/NN they/PRP have/VBP is/VBZ a/DT can/NN of/IN Nestea/NNP ./.
Also/RB the/DT drive/JJ thru/NN service/NN left/VBD much/JJ to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ,/, the/DT person/NN taking/VBG the/DT order/NN was/VBD hard/JJ to/TO understand/NN and/CC a/DT bit/NN rushed/VBD ./.
The/DT food/NN did/VBD come/VB out/RP quickly/RB however/RB ./.
Never/NNP tasted/VBD a/DT worse/NN barbecue/NN sauce/JJ anywhere/RB ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT signature/NN ribs/NNS and/CC sauce/NN ,/, with/IN fries/NNS ,/, &/CC slaw/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN had/VBD a/DT tang/NN to/TO it/PRP that/IN I/PRP should/MD have/VB recognized/VBN as/IN spoiled/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT ribs/NNS were/VBD dry/JJ ./.
And/CC to/TO make/VB matters/NNS worse/NN ,/, all/DT of/IN my/PRP$ fries/NNS were/VBD covered/VBN in/IN the/DT sauce/NN ?/.
Our/PRP$ waitress/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC helped/VBD guide/JJ us/PRP through/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN and/CC cleanliness/NN was/VBD substandard/NN for/IN a/DT supposed/VBN Cleveland/NN Icon/NN ,/, or/CC any/DT eatery/NN for/IN that/DT matter/NN ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN fruit/JJ flies/NNS and/CC the/DT itsy-bitsy/JJ spider/NN enjoyed/VBD watching/VBG us/PRP eat/VB from/IN our/PRP$ window/NN sill/NN ./.
I/PRP genuinely/RB love/JJ this/DT place/NN ./.
My/NNP one/CD request/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT place/NN should/MD start/VB a/DT delivery/NN service/NN ./.
The/DT neighborhood/NN is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT best/NN ,/, and/CC since/IN all/DT my/JJ friends/NNS in/IN Cleveland/NNS are/VBP Case/NNP students/NNS ,/, no/DT one/NN is/VBZ really/RB inclined/VBN to/TO answer/JJR my/NNS fried/VBD chicken/VBN hankering/NN at/IN 10pm/CD because/IN to/TO them/PRP ,/, the/DT fear/NN of/IN getting/NNP shot/NN is/VBZ too/RB damn/RB high/JJ (/IN but/CC I/PRP think/VBP i/JJ could/MD die/VB happy/NN with/IN some/DT HSW/NNP in/IN my/PRP$ hands/NN )/NN ./.
First/NNP let/NNP me/NNP start/VBD off/RP by/IN addressing/VBG the/DT negative/JJ dine-in/NN reviews/VBZ at/IN this/DT establishment/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP of/IN Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP as/IN one/CD of/IN those/DT places/NNS where/WRB you/PRP would/MD never/RB imagine/VB eating/JJ your/JJ food/NN inside/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ more/JJR of/IN a/DT pick-up/NN and/CC go/NN ./.
I/PRP mean..really..once/VBP taking/VBG a/DT look/NN a/DT the/DT decor/NN ,/, WHY/NNP WOULD/NNP YOU/NNP WANT/NNP TO/NNP ?/.

Just/NNP try/VBD it/PRP out/RP with/IN an/DT open/JJ mind..and/NN opt/VBD out/IN of/IN dining/NN in/IN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP easily/VBN disgruntled/JJ by/IN the/DT surroundings/NNS ./.

By/IN that/DT I/PRP mean/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB located/VBN in/IN the/DT best/JJS neighborhood/NN ./.

I/PRP give/VBP the/DT food/NN itself/VBD a/DT 4/JJ out/NN of/IN 5/NN ./.

I/PRP 'll/VBP never/RB know/VBN because/IN I/PRP probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB go/VB back/RB ./.

The/DT sauce/NN and/CC the/DT creamy/NN slaw/NN packed/VBD great/JJ flavor/NN --/: and/CC made/VBD this/DT Polish/JJ Boy/NNP a/DT bit/NN messy/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP had/VBD crinkle/JJ fries/NNS since/IN my/PRP$ elementary/NN school/NN days/NNS ,/, so/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN nostalgia/NN there/RB ./.

The/DT bun/NN could/MD have/VB used/VBN some/DT toasting/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ my/JJ personal/JJ preference/NN ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB many/JJ smiles/NNS from/IN the/DT staff/NN when/WRB ordering/JJ ./.

2/CD words/NNS :/: FRIED/NNP CHICKEN/NNP ./.

The/DT chicken/NN looked/VBD like/IN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN sitting/VBG under/IN the/DT heating/NN lamp/NN a/DT little/JJ too/NN long/RB but/CC it/PRP was/VBD super/JJ crunchy/JJ and/CC super/NN juicy/NN ./.

A/DT little/JJ runny/NN for/IN my/NN taste/NN but/CC delicious/JJ goodness/NN ./.
Cole/NNP slaw/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC a/DT little/JJ too/RB much/JJ sauce/NN and/CC not/RB enough/RB crunch/JJ ./.

Strangely/RB enough/RB they/PRP have/VBP a/DT vending/VBG machine/NN in/IN the/DT dining/NN area/NN so/IN I/PRP guess/VBP it/PRP really/RB is/VBZ like/IN a/DT cafeteria/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT no-atmosphere/JJ soul/JJ food/NN joint/NN ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB lucky/JJ if/IN the/DT staff/NN does/VBZ n't/RB actively/RB mock/JJ you/PRP before/IN shoving/VBG the/DT food/NN across/IN a/DT sticky/JJ counter/NN in/IN your/PRP$ general/JJ direction/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB from/IN my/PRP$ quintuple-star/JJ review/NN ,/, that/WDT food/NN is/VBZ reason/RB enough/RB ./.

We/PRP had/VBD the/DT polish/JJ boy/NN hot/NN dog-/NN that/WDT was/VBD featured/VBN on/IN man/NN vs/NNS food/NN ./.
First/NNP let/NNP me/NNP point/NN out/IN that/IN the/DT polish/JJ girl/NN is/VBZ the/DT hot/NN dog/NN featured/VBD on/IN man/NN vs/NNS food-/JJ although/IN they/PRP call/VBP it/PRP a/DT polish/JJ boy/NN ./.
ANYWAY/NNP .../:
It/PRP was/VBD amazingggg/JJ ./.
One/CD all/DT beef/NN hog/NN topped/VBD with/IN coleslaw/NN ,/, their/PRP$ own/JJ tangy/NN hot/NN sauce/NN with/IN some/DT BBQ/NNP flavors/NNS as/RB well/RB ,/, fresh/JJ cut/NN fries/NNS and/CC pulled/VBD pork/NN .../: ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB I/PRP could/MD eat/VB the/DT entire/JJ thing/NN when/WRB I/PRP saw/VBP it-/JJ it/PRP was/VBD huge/JJ !/.
But/CC I/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP so/RB much/RB I/PRP engulfed/VBD it/PRP entirely/RB !/.
The/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO actually/RB go/VB back/RB in/IN and/CC get/VB more/RBR sauce/JJ to/TO go/NN ./.
Their/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN looked/JJ incredible/NN so/IN I/PRP HAD/VBP to/TO try/VB it-/JJ I/PRP just/RB ordered/VBP three/CD wings/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO see/VB how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD ./.

We/PRP had/VBD awesome/JJ customer/NN service-/NN everyone/NN was/VBD helpful/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
I/PRP read/VBD some/DT reviews/NNS and/CC saw/VBD that/IN some/DT people/NNS were/VBD afraid/JJ to/TO eat/NN here/RB and/CC suggested/VBD drive/JJ thru/NN .../:
I/PRP guess/VBZ that/IN depends/NNS on/IN when/WRB you/PRP go/VBP ./.
I/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP afternoon/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN so/RB we/PRP could/MD n't/RB eat/VB in/IN the/DT restaurant-/NN but/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB gladly/RB ./.
There/NNS were/VBD n't/RB any/DT sketchy/NN characters/NNS at/IN all/DT ,/, everyone/NN was/VBD friendly/RB ./.

OMG/IN that/DT was/VBD sooooo/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT fries/NNS ,/, coleslaw/NN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ unique/JJ bbq/NN sauce/NN just/RB work/NN with/IN the/DT polish/JJ sausage/NN to/TO create/VB a/DT one-of-a-kind/JJ taste/NN treat/NN sensation/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN !/.
It/PRP was/VBD so/RB ridiculously/RB good/JJ I/PRP talked/VBD some/DT business/NN colleagues/NNS into/IN going/VBG back/NNS with/IN me/PRP a/DT few/JJ days/NNS later/JJ and/CC they/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB impressed/VBN ./.
One/CD of/IN them/PRP had/VBD the/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN (/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ signature/NN sauce/NN on/IN top/JJ )/NN and/CC he/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD damned/VBN good/JJ ./.
I/PRP also/RB tried/VBD some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ ribs/NNS which/WDT were/VBD okay/NN --/: I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG better/JJR considering/NN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT bbq/soul/JJ food/NN joint/NN but/CC they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB as/RB tender/JJ as/IN I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
That/DT said/VBD ,/, they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ ./.
On/IN my/PRP$ second/JJ trip/NN ,/, I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Polish/JJ Girl/NNP (/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT Polish/JJ Boy/NNP plus/NN pulled/VBD pork/NN on/IN top/JJ of/IN everything/NN else/RB )/IN ;/: I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN but/CC I/PRP preferred/VBP the/DT Polish/JJ Boy/NNP over/IN the/DT Polish/JJ Girl/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB that/IN the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN is/VBZ bad/JJ --/: -/JJ it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ --/: -/JJ but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ one/CD too/RB many/JJ flavors/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN at/IN once/RB ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB bad/JJ but/CC it/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB necessary/JJ ./.
What/WP was/VBD so-so/JJ :/: the/DT decoration/NN and/CC atmosphere/RB is/VBZ that/IN of/IN a/DT run/NN down/IN old/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
That/DT said/VBD .../: .WHO/NNP CARES/NNP ?/NNP ?/. ?/.
I/PRP come/VBP for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, not/RB the/DT decorations/NNS ./.
You/PRP want/VBP decorations/NNS ?/.
Go/NNP to/TO the/DT Cheesecake/NNP Factory/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT dive/JJ but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ reasonably/RB clean/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN bad/JJ ./.
The/DT neighborhood/NN is/VBZ n't/RB great/JJ but/CC I/PRP went/VBD during/IN the/DT daytime/JJ (/NN by/IN bus/NN ,/, no/DT less/JJR )/NNS and/CC felt/VBD reasonably/RB safe/JJ ./.
Nobody/NN gave/VBD me/PRP the/DT 'evil/NN eye/VBP '/JJ even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB obvious/JJ I/PRP was/VBD ``/`` not/RB from/IN around/NN here/RB ./. ''/''
The/DT service/NN :/: the/DT people/NNS behind/IN the/DT counter/NN were/VBD n't/RB all/DT smiles/NNS and/CC energy/NN but/CC they/PRP got/VBD the/DT job/NN done/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN tasted/VBD good/JJ ./.
Before/NNP going/NNP there/RB ,/, I/PRP read/VBP all/PDT the/DT Yelp/NNP reviews/VBZ and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS are/VBP trashing/VBG the/DT employees/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ attitude/NN ./.
Again/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ NOT/NNP the/DT Cheesecake/NNP Factory/NN with/IN some/DT chirpy/NN employee/NN who/WP acts/NNS like/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ mission/NN in/IN life/NN ./.
These/DT people/NNS would/MD probably/RB rather/RB be/VB somewhere/RB else/RB ./.
But/CC I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB ignored/VBN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD reasonably/RB courteous/JJ (/NN again/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD VERY/NNP clear/NNP I/PRP was/VBD a/DT tourist/NN from/IN out/IN of/IN town/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD prepared/VBN in/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ amount/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, done/NNP cleanly/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD great/JJ ./.
If/IN Cheesecake/NNP Factory/NNP level/NN service/NN is/VBZ super/NN important/JJ to/TO you/PRP ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB enjoy/VB this/DT place/NN ./.
In/IN short/JJ ,/, come/VBP for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, not/RB the/DT decorations/NNS and/CC the/DT service/NN (/NN which/WDT is/VBZ n't/RB that/IN bad/JJ ,/, just/RB do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB to/TO be/VB treated/VBN like/IN a/DT god/NN )/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP ever/RB have/VBP another/DT trip/NN to/TO Cleveland/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO HSW/NNP again/NNP ./.
PS/NNP They/PRP do/VBP sell/RB the/DT bbq/NN sauce/NN in/IN bottles/NNS and/CC I/PRP brought/VBD a/DT few/JJ home/NN to/TO try/VB and/CC recreate/VB the/DT Polish/JJ Boy/NNP ./.
Went/NNP a/DT few/JJ months/NNS ago/IN and/CC was/VBD not/RB impressed/VBN ./.
We/PRP read/VBP many/JJ great/JJ reviews/NNS but/CC we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB the/DT same/JJ experience/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN ribs/NNS and/CC other/JJ items/NNS so/IN we/PRP settled/VBD and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD sloppy/NN and/CC not/RB very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
We/PRP left/VBP and/CC ended/VBD up/RP finding/VBG something/NN to/TO eat/VB ./.
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, yes/VBZ this/DT place/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB ratchet/JJ and/CC in/IN a/DT sketchy/JJ neighborhood/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP can/MD get/VB past/NN that/IN ,/, its/PRP$ definitely/RB worth/VBD a/DT stop/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT polish/JJ girl/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN ./.
The/DT pork/NN itself/NN was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN tasteless/NN ,/, the/DT BBQ/NNP sauce/NN kind/NN of/IN overpowered/VBN everything/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT sauce/NN was/VBD also/RB a/DT little/JJ too/NN spicy/NN for/IN my/PRP$ liking/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB terrible/JJ ./.
The/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD mediocre/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP other/JJ better/NNS dive/JJ restaurants/NNS here/RB in/IN cle/NN for/IN BBQ/NNP ,/, but/CC this/DT place/NN is/VBZ n't/RB terrible/JJ ./.
Considering/NNP ``/`` Gin/NNP ''/'' or/CC Aunt/NNP Gin/NNP as/IN I/PRP call/VBP her/PRP since/IN she/PRP is/VBZ the/DT sister/NN of/IN my/PRP$ grandfather/NN (/NN Beasley/Williams/NNP )/NNP and/CC is/VBZ the/DT owner/NN of/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO give/VB our/PRP$ family/NN restaurant/VBD a/DT perfect/NN score/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN should/MD be/VB bottled/VBN its/PRP$ so/RB good/JJ and/CC one/CD thing/NN for/IN sure/JJ ,/, our/JJ quality/NN of/IN food/NN has/VBZ never/RB changed/VBN since/IN day/NN one/CD (/NN see/NN Whitmore/NNP 's/POS if/IN you/PRP disagree/VBP )/RB ./.
This/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ a/DT pink/NN building/NN located/VBD in/IN the/DT ``/`` hood/NN ''/'' of/IN Cleveland/NNP ,/, OH/NNP but/CC no/DT one/CD gets/NNS ``/`` gangsta/NN ''/'' around/IN the/DT Bar/NNP B/NNP Q/NNP .../: it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB not/RB Kosher/VB !/.
I/PRP always/RB loved/VBD their/PRP$ ribs/NNS ./.
No/DT games/NNS ,/, lots/NNS of/IN meat/NN and/CC plenty/NN of/IN sauce/NN with/IN little/JJ attitude/NN about/IN it/PRP !/.
Prices/NNS are/VBP general/JJ $/$ 7/CD -/-NONE- $/$ 10/CD dinners/NNS ,/, $/$ 6/CD -/-NONE- $/$ 8/CD sandwich/JJ meals/NNS ./.
Cleveland/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/RB city/VBN that/IN serves/NNS barbeque/NN fries/VBZ which/WDT is/VBZ when/WRB they/PRP take/VBP deep/JJ fried/VBN French/JJ fries/NNS and/CC drench/VBP them/PRP in/IN barbeque/NN sauce/NN .../: .ummmm/NN good/JJ !/.
Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP is/VBZ the/DT best/NN ,/, but/CC then/RB again/RB anything/VBN produced/NN by/IN my/NNP family/NN I/PRP will/MD deem/VB as/IN the/DT best/NN ./.
***Buyer/JJR beware/NN of/IN the/DT ``/`` Itis/NNP ''/'' ***/-NONE-
I/PRP love/VBP their/PRP$ fried/JJ chicken/NN with/IN their/PRP$ house/NN made/VBD hot/NN sauce/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT epitome/NN of/IN southern/JJ fried/JJ chicken/NN ./.
The/DT coleslaw/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC creamy/NN ./.
Fries/NNS are/VBP your/VBG standard/JJ crinkle/NN cut/NN fries/NNS but/CC great/JJ to/TO dip/VB in/IN their/PRP$ sauce/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP also/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT polish/JJ girl/NN and/CC polish/VB boy/JJ (/NNS Cleveland/VBP staple/JJ )/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP the/DT sauce/NN but/CC their/PRP$ ribs/NNS are/VBP a/DT little/JJ fatty/NN and/CC not/RB meaty/JJ ,/, therefore/RB I/PRP personally/RB do/VBP n't/RB order/VB the/DT ribs/NNS ./.
So/IN that/DT is/VBZ the/DT food/NN ./.
Now/RB the/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN great/JJ but/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB expect/VB a/DT fancy/NN atmosphere/RB and/CC as/RB long/JJ as/IN you/PRP know/VBP what/WP to/TO expect/NNS in/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN then/RB you/PRP are/VBP fine/RB ./.
Now/RB the/DT service/NN is/VBZ another/DT story/NN ./.
Expect/NNP an/DT attitude/NN ,/, rude/NN servers/NNS and/CC someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ just/RB downright/NN annoyed/VBD that/IN you/PRP are/VBP bothering/VBG them/PRP by/IN making/NN them/PRP have/VBP to/TO work/NN by/IN preparing/VBG your/PRP$ order/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB run/VBD out/IN of/IN food/NN and/CC no/DT matter/NN what/WP time/NN it/PRP is/VBZ they/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB making/VBN any/DT more/RBR because/IN once/RB again/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB much/JJ work/NN ./.
I/PRP therefore/VBP have/VBP to/TO call/NN to/TO make/VB sure/JJ they/PRP have/VBP certain/JJ types/NNS of/IN food/NN like/IN chicken/NN breasts/NNS before/IN I/PRP come/VBP as/IN I/PRP live/VBP 30/CD minutes/NNS away/RB and/CC ca/MD n't/RB tell/VB you/PRP how/WRB many/JJ times/NNS I/PRP made/VBD the/DT drive/JJ and/CC was/VBD told/JJ they/PRP are/VBP out/IN of/IN white/JJ meat/NN and/CC do/VBP n't/RB plan/VB to/TO make/VB anymore/RB ./.
They/PRP also/RB close/JJ early/JJ if/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB like/IN being/VBG open/JJ anymore/NN ./.
I/PRP actually/RB had/VBD them/PRP turn/IN the/DT lights/NNS and/CC drive/JJ through/IN system/NN off/IN on/IN me/NN when/WRB I/PRP drive/VBP up/RP an/DT hour/NN or/CC two/CD before/IN their/PRP$ official/NN closing/JJ time/NN ./.
So/RB to/TO sum/VB up/RP ,/, the/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, service/NN is/VBZ horrible/JJ so/RB if/IN you/PRP go/VBP in/IN expecting/VBG someone/NN to/TO not/RB like/IN you/PRP to/TO get/VB some/DT great/JJ BBQ/NN then/RB you/PRP will/MD be/VB happy/JJ ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP sorry/JJ for/IN everyone/NN that/IN has/VBZ no/DT idea/NN what/WP they/PRP are/VBP missing/VBG out/IN on/IN .../NN ./. Let/NNP it/PRP b/VBD known/VBN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN amazing/VBG BBQ/NNP in/IN Texas/NNP ,/, Oklahoma/NNP ,/, Memphis/NNP ,/, Chicago/NNP .../:
I/PRP 'm/VBP bias/JJ to/TO KC/NNP but/CC crap/NN is/VBZ crap/NN and/CC this/DT was/VBD crap/NN ./.
The/DT Rib/NNP Dog/NNP sandwich/NN was/VBD an/DT interesting/JJ dish/NN that/IN consisted/JJ of/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT juiciest/JJS ,/, best/JJS tasting/VBG ribs/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/JJ wedged/JJ between/IN two/CD hot/NN dog/NN buns/NNS ./.
The/DT sides/NNS were/VBD a/DT slaw/NN that/WDT was/VBD n't/RB two/CD wet/JJ which/WDT sat/JJ well/RB since/IN the/DT fries/NNS and/CC ribs/NNS were/VBD drizzled/VBN with/IN the/DT establishment/NN 's/POS famous/JJ sauce/NN ./.

Having/VBG grown/VBN up/RP eating/VBG barbecue/NN in/IN South/NNP Carolina/NNP ,/, Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP is/VBZ a/DT place/NN that/WDT can/MD scratch/VB my/PRP$ itch/NN ./.

I/PRP settled/VBD on/IN the/DT fish/JJ ,/, shrimp/NN ,/, and/CC fry/JJ combo/NN -/JJ the/DT boyfriend/NN went/VBD for/IN the/DT chicken/NN ,/, rib/NN ,/, fry/JJ combo/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD excellent/JJ choices/NNS ./.
Be/NNP sure/VBD to/TO work/NN on/IN those/DT biceps/NNS before/IN you/PRP come/VBP here/RB because/IN the/DT boxes/NNS of/IN food/NN they/PRP give/VBP you/PRP weigh/VBP a/DT ton/NN !/.

Without/IN a/DT single/JJ doubt/NN the/DT absolute/JJ best/NN fried/VBD chicken/VBN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB had/VBN ./.

We/PRP got/VBD a/DT Polish/JJ boy/NN and/CC girl/JJ (/NN intrigued/VBN by/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN pulled/JJ pork/NN on/IN the/DT girl/JJ )/NN ./.
Truth/NNP be/NNP told/NNP ,/, we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO eat/NN in/IN so/IN we/PRP got/VBP it/PRP to/TO go/VB since/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB super/JJ clean/JJ but/CC most/RB because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT air/NN conditioning/VBG on/IN ./.
The/DT guy/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN us/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT slab/NN of/IN ribs/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ ALOT/NNP of/IN meat/NN but/CC said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD working/VBG down/IN the/DT road/NN and/CC had/VBD never/RB been/VBN there/RB ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT conversations/NNS I/PRP heard/NN was/VBD that/IN of/IN ppl/NN eating/VBG there/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ the/DT real/JJ deal/NN and/CC will/MD definitely/RB go/VB back/RB to/TO try/VB the/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN ./.
BTW/NNP ,/, the/DT cost/NN of/IN our/PRP$ boy/NN and/CC girl/NN was/VBD less/JJR than/IN $/$ 12/CD ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP ./.
HSW/NNP is/VBZ the/DT best/NN ./.
Best/NNP fried/VBD chicken/VBN north/NN of/IN the/DT Mason/Dixon/NNP ./.
I/PRP have/VBP enjoyed/VBN HSW/NNP many/JJ times/NNS over/IN the/DT years/NNS ./.

Great/NNP food/NN ,/, will/MD be/VB back/RB again/RB and/CC again/RB and/CC again/RB ./.
Thank/NNP you/PRP HSW/NNP for/IN offering/NN this/DT fine/NN food/NN in/IN the/DT Cleveland/NNP area/NN ./.
Superb/NNP chicken/NN with/IN service/NN that/IN is/VBZ a/DT little/RB on/IN the/DT slow/JJ side/NN ./.
Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP has/VBZ very/RB good/JJ fried/VBN chicken/NN ./.
The/DT pieces/NNS are/VBP huge/JJ and/CC very/RB crispy/JJ ./.
You/PRP can/MD have/VB the/DT restaurant/NN 's/POS famous/JJ barbecue/NN sauce/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN or/CC served/VBN on/IN the/DT chicken/NN -/NN personally/RB I/PRP like/IN the/DT chicken/NN better/NN without/IN the/DT sauce/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT ribs/NNS are/VBP decent/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ the/DT winner/NN here/RB ./.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB give/VB this/DT place/NN 4/NN stars/NNS was/VBD that/IN it/PRP took/VBD quite/RB a/DT while/NN (/RB more/JJR than/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS )/VBP for/IN me/PRP to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ chicken/NN both/DT of/IN the/DT times/NNS I/PRP came/VBD here/RB ./.
While/IN I/PRP appreciated/VBD how/WRB fresh/JJ the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN the/DT new/JJ batches/NNS of/IN food/NN could/MD have/VB come/VBN out/RP more/RBR quickly/RB ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT serving/VBG could/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR efficient/JJ ./.
When/WRB I/PRP have/VBP time/VBN to/TO wait/VB though/IN and/CC want/VBP to/TO buy/VB a/DT large/JJ tray/NN of/IN fried/VBN chicken/NN for/IN a/DT party/NN ,/, this/DT will/MD be/VB the/DT place/NN that/IN I/PRP will/MD be/VB going/VBG to/TO ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP like/IN to/TO give/VB them/PRP more/JJR stars/NNS but/CC let/NN 's/POS focus/NN on/IN the/DT obvious/JJ :/: The/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN :/: Tasted/VBN like/IN someone/NN left/IN it/PRP out/RP under/IN the/DT heat/NN lamp/NN to/TO the/DT point/NN it/PRP was/VBD fermenting/VBG ./.
A/DT very/JJ sweet/JJ taste/NN to/TO it/PRP .../: like/IN it/PRP was/VBD off/RP ./.
The/DT chicken/NN :/: It/PRP was/VBD ok/JJ and/CC all/DT but/CC nothing/NN special/NN ./.
The/DT Po/NNP Boy/NNP :/: It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Just/NNP nothing/NN special/VBD really/RB .../: .meaning/VBG it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB an/DT iron/NN chef/NN or/CC a/DT recipe/NN to/TO be/VB passed/VBG down/IN to/TO make/VB that/DT right/NN ./.
Fries/NNS :/: Meh/NNP Sauce/NNP :/: Really/RB good/JJ but/CC on/IN rather/RB bland/NN and/CC dry/JJ food/NN ,/, its/PRP$ just/RB ok/JJ ./.
Atmosphere/RB :/: Ghetto/NNP and/CC cold/JJ (/NN temperature/NN and/CC vibe/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO give/VB them/PRP another/DT shot/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, at/IN best/JJS ,/, that/IN just/RB means/JJ they/PRP are/VBP inconsistent/JJ if/IN I/PRP like/VBP it/PRP next/JJ time/NN .../: .../:
Omg/NNP !/.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN eating/VBG there/NN of/IN and/CC on/IN for/IN years/NNS and/CC the/DT quality/NN has/VBZ just/RB gone/NN down/IN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/NNS but/CC the/DT meat/NN seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB of/IN lower/JJR quality/NN and/CC poor/JJ cut/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/JJ stellar/JJ as/IN it/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT simple/NN rib/NN dinner/NN and/CC the/DT ribs/NNS were/VBD stringy/JJ and/CC tough/JJ and/CC the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD mush/JJ ./.
I/PRP dont/VBP like/IN to/TO give/VB poor/JJ ratings/NNS but/CC this/DT is/VBZ just/RB not/RB the/DT level/NN of/IN service/NN that/IN I/PRP know/VBP hot/JJ sauce/NN used/VBD to/TO give/VB and/CC it/PRP needs/-NONE- to/TO be/VB rectified/VBN ./.
Came/NN to/TO Cleveland/NNP and/CC just/RB had/VBD to/TO try/VB a/DT Polish/JJ boy-/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD Saturday/NNP so/NNP Seti/NNP 's/POS was/VBD n't/RB open/JJ ./.
Decided/NNP Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP would/MD be/VB a/DT decent/JJ alternative/NN given/IN the/DT circumstances/NNS ./.
All/DT I/PRP ordered/VBP was/VBD one/CD Polish/JJ boy/NN for/IN $/$ 5.25/CD from/IN a/DT not/RB too/RB friendly/RB set/VBN of/IN workers/NNS and/CC was/VBD given/VBN my/JJ order/NN in/IN 2-3/CD minutes/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN I/PRP noticed/VBD was/VBD that/IN this/DT could/MD not/RB be/VB eaten/VBN by/IN hand/NN ./.
I/PRP picked/VBD up/RP the/DT dog/NN and/CC the/DT bun/NN immediately/RB fell/VBD apart/NN from/IN being/VBG drenched/VBN in/IN sauce/NN ./.
I/PRP managed/VBP to/TO get/VB a/DT bite/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT flavors/NNS and/CC they/PRP mixed/VBP fairly/RB well/RB but/CC nothing/RB special/JJ ./.
The/DT hot/NN dog/NN had/VBD good/JJ beef/NN flavor/NN but/CC tasted/VBD like/IN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN sitting/VBG around/IN for/IN awhile/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD regular/JJ crinkle/NN fries/NNS like/IN you/PRP get/VB in/IN an/DT Ore-Ida/NNP bag/NN and/CC the/DT coleslaw/NN had/VBD a/DT strong/JJ mayonnaise/NN taste/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD the/DT hot/NN barbecue/NN sauce/JJ put/NN on/IN the/DT dog/NN ./.
Overall/NNP despite/VBD not/RB being/VBG assembled/NN of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS ingredients/NNS I/PRP think/VBP the/DT polish/JJ boy/NN was/VBD better/JJR than/IN the/DT sum/NN of/IN its/PRP$ parts/NNS and/CC actually/RB tasted/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ when/WRB you/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT bite/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT elements/NNS ./.
Fried/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, awesome/JJ with/IN the/DT BBQ/NNP sauce/NN !/.
Picked/NNP up/IN a/DT few/JJ bottles/NNS to/TO take/VB home/NN ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB wait/VB to/TO try/VB them/PRP out/IN ./.
Gut/NNP rot/NN ./.
1/4/CD meat/NN ,/, 1/4/CD fat/NN ,/, 1/2/CD sauce/NN ,/, that/IN pretty/RB much/JJ sums/NNS up/IN the/DT ribs/NNS at/IN HSW/NNP ./.
Not/RB the/DT cleanest/JJS place/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB been/VBN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB good/JJ .../NN at/IN all/DT ./.
Yech/NNP !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP giving/VBG them/PRP 5/JJ stars/NNS for/IN the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN alone/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ amazing/VBG ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ this/DT super/NN crunchy/NN crust/NN that/WDT is/VBZ totally/RB unlike/JJ anything/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD on/IN fried/VBN chicken/NN before/IN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN having/NN your/NN chicken/NN thoroughly/RB egg-battered/JJ and/CC then/RB friend/VB crispy/NN ./.
The/DT result/NN is/VBZ positively/RB delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT ribs/NNS too/RB ./.
They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB boil/VB their/PRP$ ribs/NNS before/IN cooking/VBG them/PRP ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP like/VBP 'fall/JJ off/IN the/DT bone/NN '/POS type/NN ribs/NNS ,/, these/DT are/VBP not/RB for/IN you/PRP ./.
These/DT are/VBP good/JJ ribs/NNS to/TO knaw/NN on/IN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD also/RB impressively/RB big/JJ ./.
I/PRP almost/RB docked/VBD them/PRP a/DT star/NN for/IN borderline/NN surly/RB service/NN and/CC lack/NN of/IN A/C/NNP ,/, but/CC at/IN this/DT price/NN (/VBD $/$ 30/CD for/IN four/CD people/NNS +leftovers/NNS )/IN I/PRP can/MD hardly/RB complain/VB ./.
They/PRP 'll/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB much/RB grouchier/JJR than/IN that/DT to/TO keep/VB me/PRP away/RB from/IN that/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN ./.
Things/NNS that/IN were/VBD great/JJ :/: +Mac/NNP n/NNP cheese/NN +Fried/VBD chicken/VBN +Sausage/NN +BBQ/NNP sauce/NN Things/NNS that/WDT were/VBD not/RB great/JJ :/: -Not/JJ terribly/RB friendly/RB (/VBN to/TO us/PRP )/VB -No/JJ diet/NN in/IN the/DT soda/NN machine/NN -Greens/NNS were/VBD only/RB so/RB so/RB -The/JJ sausage/NN ends/VBZ up/RP too/RB soaked/VBD in/IN slaw/NN and/CC bbq/NN sauce/NN to/TO actually/RB eat/VB with/IN your/PRP$ hands/NNS ./.
The/DT bun/NN will/MD just/RB fall/VB apart/NN ./.
-Zero/NNP ambiance/NN ./.
They/PRP could/MD use/VB the/DT services/NNS of/IN a/DT carpenter/NN and/CC a/DT painter/NN ./.
Final/JJ note/NN :/: this/DT review/NN is/VBZ for/IN the/DT pink/NN location/NN on/IN Carnegie/NNP and/CC does/VBZ not/RB apply/RB to/TO the/DT Lee/NNP Rd/NNP location/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD only/RB mediocre/RB IMHO/NNP ./.
Stopped/NNP by/IN hotsauce/NN williams/NNS for/IN some/DT takeout/NN today/NN after/IN my/PRP$ hubby/NN 's/POS cleveland/NN clinic/NN appt/NN ./.
Read/RB all/DT the/DT hype/JJ &/NN was/VBD so/RB excited/VBN to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT drive/JJ thru/NN speaker/NN does/VBZ n't/RB work/VB &/CC you/PRP can/MD vaguely/RB read/VB the/DT menu/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN cod/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT tilapia/NN sandwich/JJ (/NN 5.50/CD )/NNS ,/, combo/NNP 2chicken/CD &/CC 2ribs/CD w//NNP coleslaw/NNP &/CC macaroni/NNP &/CC cheese/NN (/NN 12/CD )/NNS ./.
My/NNP hubby/NNP got/VBD the/DT polish/JJ boy/NN (/NN 5.25/CD )/NNS ./.
Well/NNP overall/NNP we/PRP were/VBD DISAPPOINTED/NNP !/.
The/DT polish/JJ boy/NN was/VBD SUPER/NNP SALTY/NNP &/CC the/DT frozen/NN crinkle/NN fries/VBZ they/PRP slapped/VBD on/IN top/NNS were/VBD a/DT soggy/JJ mess/NN !/.
My/NNP tilapia/NNP sandwich/NN was/VBD a/DT paper/NN thin/JJ breaded/VBD piece/NN of/IN fish/JJ w//NN 2/CD mashed/VBD pieces/NNS of/IN white/JJ bread/NN on/IN side/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP put/VBD the/DT fish/NN on/IN a/DT bun/NN w//NN tartar/NN &/CC a/DT piece/NN of/IN lettuce/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ almost/RB inedible/JJ (/NN reference/NN picture/NN )/NN ./.
Slaw/NNP was/VBD warm/NN &/CC kind/NN of/IN soupy/NN ,/, but/CC had/VBD flavor/NN ./.
THE/NNP RIBS/NNP ARE/NNP THE/NNP ONLY/NNP THING/NNP I/PRP CAN/NNP SAY/NNP ARE/NNP WORTH/NNP IT/NNP ./.

The/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD decent/JJ ./.
Essentially/RB I/PRP paid/VBD $/$ 22/CD for/IN 2/CD ribs/NNS because/IN that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP was/VBD truly/RB satisfied/VBN with/IN ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB giving/VBN them/PRP a/DT 2nd/CD chance/NN sadly/RB .../:

Wow/NNP ./.
Did/NNP not/RB expect/VBD that/IN out/IN of/IN a/DT place/NN looking/VBG like/IN HSW/NNP ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB gon/VBN na/NN say/VBP that/IN I/PRP hated/VBD it/PRP .../: but/CC ,/, it/PRP was/VBD close/JJ ./.
My/NNP husband/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD I/PRP Cleveland/VBP to/TO see/VB the/DT Raiders/NNS play/VBP the/DT Browns/NNS ./.
We/PRP decided/VBD to/TO eat/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ,/, seeing/VBG that/IN we/PRP love/VBP man/VBN vs./NN food/NN and/CC Adam/NNP seems/NNP like/IN he/PRP has/VBZ good/JJ taste/NN ./.
We/PRP pulled/VBD up/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT outside/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN was/VBD old/JJ .../: like/IN really/RB old/JJ ./.

We/PRP walked/VBD in/IN .../NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT pink/NN explosion/NN ./.
They/PRP had/VBD everything/NN from/IN pink/NN walls/NNS ,/, to/TO pink/VB tablecloths/NNS ./.
Even/RB after/IN that/DT ,/, we/PRP thought/VBD .../: ''/'' Okay/NNP ,/, we/PRP can/MD get/VB past/JJ decor/NN '/'' ./.
We/PRP 're/VBP not/RB fancy/JJ people/NNS ,/, we/PRP just/RB want/VBP some/DT really/RB good/JJ food/NN ./. ''/''
We/PRP were/VBD hoping/VBG that/IN the/DT food/service/NN would/MD make/VB up/RP for/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB think/VB we/PRP would/MD ever/RB revive/VB food/NN ,/, considering/VBG that/IN we/PRP sat/VBP for/IN 25/CD minutes/NNS before/IN our/PRP$ order/NN was/VBD even/RB taken/VBN ./.
When/WRB our/JJ waitress/NN FINALLY/NNP got/NNP done/NNP checking/NN on/IN all/DT her/NN 3/IN other/JJ tables/NNS ,/, cleaning/VBG ,/, stocking/NN ,/, checking/VBG the/DT kitchen/NN ,/, and/CC anything/NN else/RB she/PRP could/MD think/VB of/IN ,/, we/PRP finally/RB placed/VBN our/PRP$ order/NN ./.
Which/NNP was/VBD a/DT miracle/NN seeing/VBG that/IN the/DT menus/NNS were/VBD hard/RB to/TO read/VB ./.
By/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, two/CD MASSIVE/NNP (/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP talking/VBG aunts/NNS ,/, cousins/NNS ,/, kids/NNS ,/, grandma/NN ,/, the/DT works/NNS )/VBP families/NNS walked/VBD in/IN ./.
Instead/RB of/IN turning/JJ people/NNS away/RB ,/, politely/RB explaining/VBG that/IN there/EX was/VBD no/DT room/NN to/TO seat/VB them/PRP ,/, they/PRP let/VBP them/PRP stand/VBP in/IN the/DT dining/NN room/NN ,/, waiting/VBG for/IN seats/NNS ./.
We/PRP literally/RB had/VBD people/NNS crowded/VBN around/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ standing/NN .../: it/PRP was/VBD severely/RB uncomfortable/JJ ./.
Not/RB to/TO mention/VB the/DT noise/NN level/NN with/IN all/DT of/IN those/DT people/NNS in/IN the/DT same/JJ small/JJ space/NN ./.
When/WRB our/JJ food/NN got/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD VERY/NNP good/NNP ./.
My/NNP husband/VBD loved/VBN the/DT ribs/NNS ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ chicken/NN was/VBD to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD wasted/VBN on/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD no/DT possible/JJ way/NN they/PRP could/MD have/VB made/VBN food/NN good/JJ enough/NN (/NN delicious/JJ as/IN it/PRP was/VBD )/VBN to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, energy/NN ,/, and/CC experience/IN we/PRP had/VBD ./.

The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, not/RB the/DT greatest/JJS in/IN the/DT world/NN but/CC definitely/RB in/IN the/DT top/JJ 5/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD crispy/JJ ,/, moist/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP had/VBD a/DT tangy-Chinese/JJ chicken/NN like/IN taste/NN ./.

Candied/NNP yams/NNS and/CC collard/NN greens/NNS ,/, same/JJ deal/NN ./.
Also/RB had/VBD the/DT Polish/JJ Boy/NNP ,/, probably/RB will/MD never/RB eat/VB that/DT again/NN ./.
Not/RB because/IN it/PRP tasted/VBD bad/JJ (/NN it/PRP was/VBD better/JJR than/IN I/PRP expected/VBP )/RB ,/, but/CC because/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB too/RB much/RB soul/JJ all/NN in/IN one/CD package/NN (/NN fries/NNS ,/, sauce/JJ ,/, and/CC very/RB creamy/JJ cole/NN slaw/NN slabbed/VBD onto/NN a/DT beef/NN dog/NN )/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, to/TO talk/VB about/IN why/CD this/DT place/NN is/VBZ famous/JJ :/: their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP best/JJ known/NN for/IN their/PRP$ fried/JJ chicken/NN and/CC their/PRP$ Polish/JJ Boys/NNS ./.
I/PRP opted/VBD for/IN the/DT Polish/NNP Boy/NNP ,/, and/CC asked/VBD them/PRP to/TO put/VB their/PRP$ hot/NN sauce/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT Polish/NNP Boy/NNP is/VBZ essential/JJ a/DT hot/NN dog/NN covered/VBD with/IN cole/NN slaw/NN and/CC fries/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN cayenne/NN pepper/NN seasoning/NN ./.
The/DT slaw/NN and/CC dog/NN went/VBD well/RB together/RB ,/, and/CC were/VBD actually/RB complemented/VBN by/IN the/DT cayenne/NN pepper/NN seasoning/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/NN soggy/NN for/IN my/PRP$ liking/NN and/CC the/DT hot/NN sauce/NN actually/RB took/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT overall/JJ taste/NN of/IN the/DT sandwich/NN by/IN dominating/VBG it/PRP ./.
If/IN you/PRP opt/VBP to/TO not/RB add/VB any/DT hot/NN sauce/NN ,/, this/DT should/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS Polish/JJ Boys/NNP you/PRP can/MD find/VB anywhere/RB ./.
Stefanie/NNP C./NNP mentioned/VBD that/IN their/PRP$ fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ A-MAZ-ING/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD unable/JJ to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN on/IN either/DT Euclid/NNP ,/, Carnegie/NNP ,/, or/CC Chester/NNP ,/, you/PRP definitely/RB need/VBP to/TO stop/VB by/IN ./.
You/PRP 've/VBP probably/RB driven/VBN past/JJ their/PRP$ hideously/JJ ugly/RB pink/NN and/CC blue/JJ building/NN hundreds/NNS of/IN times/NNS and/CC have/VBP never/RB stopped/VBN in/IN ./.
Well/NNP ,/, you/PRP should/MD remedy/VB that/IN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB big/JJ on/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN food/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP would/MD never/RB in/IN a/DT million/CD years/NNS order/JJ ribs/NNS because/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB to/TO get/VB barbecue/NN sauce/NN on/IN my/PRP$ face/NN ./.
I/PRP like/VBP healthier/JJR more/RBR inventive/JJ food/NN ,/, snobbier/JJR food/NN maybe/NN ?/.
But/CC damn/RB ,/, Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ ./.
KFC/NNP or/CC whoever/JJR has/VBZ NO/NNP business/NN using/VBG ``/`` finger/JJR lickin/NN '/POS good/JJ ''/'' --/: I/PRP think/VBP HSW/NNP should/MD steal/VB it/PRP ./.
My/NNP family/NN was/VBD all/DT about/RB going/VBG to/TO the/DT rib/NN cook-off/NN yesterday/NN ./.
When/WRB it/PRP started/VBD to/TO pour/VB nobody/NN wanted/VBD to/TO go/VB anymore/RB ./.
Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP was/VBD our/VBN next/JJ choice/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD very/RB happy/JJ that/IN it/PRP rained/VBD ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN and/CC rib/NN dinner/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB NOT/VB have/VB ribs/NNS at/IN HSW/NNP ./.
It/PRP came/VBD with/IN 2/CD sides/NNS ./.
I/PRP chose/VBP collard/NN greens/NNS (/NN of/IN course/NN )/NNS and/CC cole/NN slaw/NN ./.
My/NNP brother/NN and/CC I/PRP also/RB split/VBD a/DT pork/NN shoulder/NN sandwich/JJ (/NN cuz/NN we/PRP 're/VBP fatties/NNS )/RB ./.
Yep/NNP ,/, the/DT one/NN that/IN was/VBD featured/VBN on/IN No/DT Reservations/NNS ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
The/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 'd/MD ever/RB had/VBD ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB I/PRP 've/VBP actually/RB eaten/VBN that/IN type/NN of/IN fried/VBN chicken/NN many/JJ places/NNS before/IN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD so/RB effing/JJ good/IN that/IN I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO make/VB out/RP with/IN it/PRP ./.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/VBD with/IN HSW/NNP was/VBD the/DT girl/JJ working/VBG the/DT register/NN ./.
She/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR polite/NNS ,/, maybe/NN even/RB a/DT tiny/NN bit/NN personable/JJ ,/, or/CC perhaps/RB .../:
I/PRP dunno/VBP .../: .helpful/JJ ?/.
and/CC not/RB a/DT complete/JJ bitch/NN ?/.
We/PRP were/VBD almost/RB afraid/JJ of/IN her/PRP ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB for/IN sure/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB hope/VBP the/DT Trunchbull/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB working/VBG ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO admit/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB one/CD to/TO line-up/JJ to/TO sample/VB any/DT food/NN described/NN as/IN ``/`` spicy/NN ''/'' or/CC ``/`` hot/NN ./. ''/''
Luckily/RB ,/, Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP signature/NN bbq/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ not/RB spicy/JJ as/IN the/DT name/NN originally/RB suggested/VBD to/TO me/PRP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT ribs/NNS ,/, coleslaw/NN ,/, and/CC french/JJ fries/NNS ,/, all/DT drizzled/VBD with/IN the/DT mild/NN bbq/NN sauce/NN ./.
As/IN you/PRP might/MD expect/VB ,/, this/DT was/VBD a/DT generous/JJ portion/NN of/IN smoky/NN ribs/NNS and/CC I/PRP did/VBD not/RB even/RB come/VB close/JJ to/TO finishing/VBG the/DT meal/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD fine/VBN with/IN me/PRP ,/, because/IN now/RB I/PRP have/VBP leftovers/NNS for/IN lunch/NN !/.
The/DT rib/NN dinner/NN ,/, combined/VBN with/IN a/DT Pepsi/NNP ,/, totaled/VBD approximately/RB $/$ 10/CD ./.
My/NNP friend/NN purchased/VBD the/DT chicken/NN dinner/NN (/VBD fried/VBN chicken/NN )/NNS with/IN mac/NN and/CC chees/NNS subbed/VBD for/IN the/DT coleslaw/NN ./.
Substitutions/NNS are/VBP a/DT slight/NN up-charge/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP to/TO me/VB for/IN home-style/JJ mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN ./.
She/PRP chose/VBD to/TO have/VB her/PRP bbq/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
You/PRP must/MD request/VB this/DT ,/, otherwise/NN that/IN ladle/NN of/IN sauce/JJ drops/NNS on/IN the/DT fries/NNS and/CC all/DT ./.
The/DT three/CD of/IN our/PRP$ meals/NNS totaled/VBD around/IN $/$ 30/CD ,/, and/CC if/IN I/PRP could/MD make/VB one/CD suggestion/NN to/TO anyone/NN reading/NN this/DT ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB to/TO try/VB the/DT ``/`` family/NN meal/NN ''/'' which/WDT seems/-NONE- to/TO include/VB an/DT insane/NN amount/NN of/IN food/NN (/IN I/PRP guess/VBP enough/RB to/TO feed/VB a/DT family/NN )/NN at/IN only/RB $/$ 28/CD ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ probably/RB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN that/IN the/DT 3/NN of/IN us/PRP chose/VBP not/RB to/TO share/VB the/DT ``/`` family/NN meal/NN ''/'' as/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB any/DT of/IN us/PRP need/VBP that/IN much/JJ mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN ,/, ribs/NNS ,/, and/CC fried/VBD chicken/NN !/.
I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO suggest/VB that/IN anyone/NN thinking/NNS of/IN ordering/VBG food/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN visit/NN the/DT Hot/NNP Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP website/JJ but/CC as/IN I/PRP write/VBP this/DT entry/NN ,/, their/PRP$ website/NN does/VBZ not/RB seem/VB to/TO be/VB active/JJ ./.
Ordering/NNP may/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ confusing/NN for/IN a/DT first/JJ time/NN customer/NN stepping/VBG up/RP to/TO the/DT register/NN as/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN is/VBZ not/RB clearly/RB visible/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP come/VBP armed/VBN with/IN the/DT information/NN I/PRP have/VBP given/VBN you/PRP ,/, you/PRP should/MD be/VB all/DT set/NN ./.
Get/NNP the/DT family/NN meal/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP ordering/VBG for/IN a/DT group/NN (/VBD $/$ 28/CD ?/.
Why/WRB not/RB !/JJ )/NN ./.
And/CC if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB for/IN you/PRP ,/, try/IN the/DT chicken/NN dinner/NN ,/, coleslaw/NN ,/, and/CC mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN (/NNS slight/VBD up/RP charge/NN for/IN the/DT mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN )/NN with/IN sauce/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN for/IN approximately/RB $/$ 10/CD ./.
Enjoy/NNP !/.
Hey/NNP now/RB .../: this/DT is/VBZ good/JJ BBQ/NN .../: for/IN Cleveland/NNP !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT down-and-dirty/JJ BBQ/NNP joint/NNP ./.
The/DT interior/NN is/VBZ pink/NN and/CC blue/JJ --/: not/RB exactly/RB the/DT most/RBS appetizing/JJ colors/NNS ./.
If/IN they/PRP bother/RB you/VBP that/IN much/RB ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ always/RB the/DT drive-thru/NN ./.
When/WRB you/PRP walk/VBP in/IN you/PRP tell/VBP the/DT lady/NN at/IN the/DT counter/NN what/WP you/PRP want/VBP (/RB from/IN the/DT single/JJ sheet/NN of/IN paper/NN on/IN the/DT counter/NN that/IN shows/VBZ the/DT menu/NN )/NN ./.
She/PRP takes/VBZ your/JJ money/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB you/PRP pick/VB up/RP your/PRP$ food/NN at/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT counter/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ kinda/NN like/IN a/DT school/NN cafeteria/NN --/: food/NN is/VBZ under/IN hot/NN lamps/NNS and/CC kept/VBD hot/NN in/IN foodservice/JJ trays/NNS ./.
Just/NNP about/IN every/DT booth/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN has/VBZ ripped/VBN and/CC patched/VBN ``/`` pleather/RB ./. ''/''
Classic/NNP ./.
Service/NNP is/VBZ very/RB sllloooowwwww/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT pulled/VBN pork/NN sandwich/NN --/: tender/NN pork/NN nestled/VBD in/IN between/IN 2/CD slices/NNS of/IN white/JJ Wonder/NNP bread/NN and/CC topped/VBD with/IN a/DT slathering/NN of/IN Williams/NNS '/POS own/JJ bbq/NN sauce/NN and/CC coleslaw/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRP got/VBD a/DT small/JJ side/NN of/IN macaroni/NN and/CC cheese/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
We/PRP also/RB got/VBD some/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN and/CC that/DT was/VBD damn/JJ good/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP had/VBD hot/VBN sauce/JJ Williams/NNP I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB the/DT sizes/NNS ./.
So/RB between/IN 3/JJ people/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP like/IN $/$ 40/CD worth/CD of/IN chicken/NN on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN from/IN cleveland/NN to/TO Columbus/NNP ./.
By/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP got/VBD there/RB ,/, all/DT the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD gone/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP never/RB eaten/VBN a/DT tastier/NN chicken/NN in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN and/CC found/VBD the/DT ribs/NNS to/TO be/VB rather/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP love/VBP soul/JJ food/NN !/.
We/PRP 've/VBP driven/VBN past/JJ Hot/NN Sauce/NNP Williams/NNP any/DT number/NN of/IN times/NNS ,/, always/RB on/IN our/PRP$ way/NN to/TO some/DT other/JJ event/NN ,/, always/RB promising/VBG that/IN we/PRP 'd/VBP stop/VBN ``/`` next/JJ time/NN ./. ''/''
Well/NNP ``/`` next/JJ time/NN ''/'' finally/RB arrived/VBN ./.
And/CC we/PRP are/VBP kicking/VBG ourselves/NNS for/IN taking/VBG so/RB long/RB ./.
The/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB eaten/VBN -/JJ juicy/NN and/CC tender/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ,/, crispy/NN on/IN the/DT outside/NN ./.
The/DT ribs/NNS were/VBD tasty/NN ,/, as/IN was/VBD the/DT sauce/NN ./.
The/DT macaroni/NN and/CC cheese/NN is/VBZ only/RB beaten/VBN by/IN the/DT memory/NN of/IN mac-and-cheese/NN from/IN a/DT sadly/JJ defunct/NN soul/JJ food/NN restaurant/NN (/IN it/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ we/PRP called/VBP it/PRP ``/`` crack-aroni/NN and/CC cheese/NN ''/'' )/NN ./.
The/DT yams/NNS and/CC baked/VBD beans/NNS were/VBD also/RB excellent/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ counter/NN service/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT spacious/JJ ,/, beaten-up/JJ dining/NN room/NN ./.
Considering/NNP that/IN the/DT dining/NN rooms/NNS in/IN the/DT soul/JJ food/NN restaurants/NNS where/WRB we/PRP ate/VBP in/IN Atlanta/NNP consisted/VBD of/IN picnic/JJ tables/NNS and/CC benches/NNS ,/, the/DT decor/NN seems/VBZ fitting/VBG ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD perfunctory/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB rude/VB ./.
In/IN sum/NN ,/, delicious/JJ food/NN that/WDT 's/POS SO/NNP bad/NN for/IN you/PRP -/JJ definitely/RB not/RB daily/JJ fare/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT choice/NN for/IN soul/JJ food/NN here/RB in/IN Cleveland/NNP ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD pretty/RB awesome/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN a/DT pretty/NN bad/JJ neighborhood/NN and/CC the/DT dinning/JJ area/NN is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT most/RBS up/RB to/TO date/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT food/NN definitely/RB saves/VBZ the/DT day/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT mounted/JJ menu/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB find/VB one/CD ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT paper/NN menu/NN on/IN the/DT front/NN counter/NN that/WDT has/VBZ seen/VBN better/JJ days/NNS ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP n't/RB bad/JJ and/CC the/DT selection/NN is/VBZ your/JJ standard/NN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO a/DT soul/JJ food/NN spot/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT 2/CD piece/NN fried/VBD chicken/VBN meal/NN ,/, with/IN sauce/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN (/NN because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB the/DT biggest/JJS fan/NN of/IN spicy/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN almost/RB feels/VBZ as/IN though/IN it/PRP was/VBD made/VBN tempura/NN style/NN ,/, the/DT crunch/NN is/VBZ very/RB different/JJ but/CC very/RB good/JJ at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS are/VBP your/VBG traditional/JJ crinkled/NN cut/NN ,/, no/DT standout/NN seasonings/NNS were/VBD detected/VBN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT fan/JJ of/IN cole/NN slaw/NN so/IN I/PRP donated/VBD mine/NN to/TO the/DT trash/NN can/MD (/VB seeing/VBG as/IN though/IN you/PRP can/MD not/RB substitute/VB sides/JJ )/NNS ./.
When/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD how/WRB much/JJ the/DT can/MD sodas/VB were/VBD ,/, the/DT cashier/NN replied/VBD ``/`` man/NN these/DT suckers/NNS are/VBP expensive/JJ $/$ 1.50/CD a/DT can/MD ./. ''/''
Being/IN that/DT I/PRP am/VBP a/DT punk/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO spicy/NN foods/NNS I/PRP had/VBD to/TO purchase/NN one/CD ./.
I/PRP was/VBD pleased/VBN to/TO learn/NN that/IN the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ n't/RB all/DT that/DT spicy/NN and/CC I/PRP could/MD tolerate/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN the/DT expensive/JJ soda/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB the/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN Cleveland/NNP ./.
Fried/JJ Chicken/NNP 1-5=5/CD ./.

I/PRP waited/VBD for/IN so/RB long/JJ to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN ,/, and/CC completely/RB hyped/VBD it/PRP up/IN for/IN myself/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD only/RB heard/VBN good/JJ things/NNS ,/, and/CC had/VBD imagined/VBN the/DT best/JJS BBQ/NN and/CC fried/VBD chicken/NN of/IN my/PRP$ life/NN ,/, with/IN comfort/NN food/NN abound/NN !/.
Sadly/RB ,/, it/PRP did/VBD not/RB live/VB up/RP to/TO my/PRP$ hopes/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD through/IN the/DT drive/JJ through/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD the/DT polish/JJ boy/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD admittedly/RB pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
But/CC their/PRP$ mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN was/VBD abysmal/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD plain/NN noodles/NNS with/IN cold/JJ cheese/NN on/IN top/JJ of/IN it/PRP ,/, not/RB saucey/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP am/VBP unashamed/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP eat/VBP a/DT TON/NNP of/IN mac/NN and/CC cheese/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB eat/VB this/DT at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP am/VBP willing/JJ to/TO try/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP 'll/MD opt/VB for/IN the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN next/JJ time/NN ./.
Here/NNP 's/POS hoping/JJ it/PRP 's/VBZ better/JJR next/JJ time/NN !/.
Although/IN the/DT outside/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ scary/NN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ to/TO die/VB for/IN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT family/NN meal/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB amazing/JJ !/NN !/NN !/VBD !/NNP !/.
The/DT fried/VBN chicken/NN with/IN the/DT sauce/JJ poured/VBN on/IN top/NN was/VBD enough/RB to/TO satisfy/NN even/RB the/DT bigger/NN BBQ/NNP fanatic/JJ the/DT ribs/NNS were/VBD amazing/VBG and/CC the/DT Mac/NNP n/NN cheese/NN is/VBZ baked/VBN and/CC very/RB good/JJ as/IN well/RB ./.
One/CD of/IN those/DT places/NNS you/PRP 'll/MD become/VB a/DT regular/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB had/VBD anything/NN here/RB other/JJ than/IN the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN but/CC the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
Good/NNP price/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
It/PRP comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT ``/`` hot/NN sauce/NN ''/'' that/IN really/RB is/VBZ more/RBR tomato/JJ based/NN than/IN spicy/NN ./.
The/DT building/location/NN is/VBZ kind/NN of/IN tacky/ratchet/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ what/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN this/DT place/NN .../: A/DT couple/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS took/VBD me/PRP here/RB ;/: they/PRP said/VBD they/PRP come/VBP here/RB every/DT now/RB and/CC then/RB and/CC enjoy/VB it/PRP ./.
But/CC .../: when/WRB they/PRP took/VBD my/PRP$ friend/NN and/CC I/PRP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/RB less/JJR than/IN underwhelmed/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/JJ four/CD people/NNS in/IN the/DT place/NN (/NN except/NN for/IN one/CD guy/NN who/WP came/NN in/IN and/CC tried/VBD to/TO sell/VB us/PRP pirated/VBD DVDs/NNP )/NNP and/CC I/PRP was/VBD the/DT last/JJ to/TO order/NN ,/, but/CC by/IN the/DT time/NN my/VBD catfish/JJ dinner/NN arrived/VBD everyone/NN else/RB had/VBD already/RB finished/VBN their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
It/PRP took/VBD them/PRP almost/RB 25/VBP minutes/NNS to/TO make/VB my/JJ food/NN ./.
So/RB for/IN 25/NN minutes/NNS I/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ long/NN look/NN at/IN their/PRP$ heat/NN lamps/NNS ./.
I/PRP watched/VBD several/JJ flies/NNS and/CC fruit/NN flies/NNS land/NN ,/, fly/RB around/IN ,/, and/CC then/RB re-land/VB on/IN the/DT coleslaw/NN and/CC fries/NNS ./.
Needlessness/NN when/WRB my/JJ food/NN actually/RB did/VBD come/VB up/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD in/IN no/DT hurry/NN to/TO eat/VB either/NN of/IN those/DT two/CD sides/NNS I/PRP had/VBD gotten/VBN ./.
I/PRP will/MD admit/VB that/IN the/DT catfish/JJ itself/NN was/VBD tasty/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT atmosphere/RB completely/RB took/VBD my/PRP$ appetite/NN away/RB ./.
The/DT one/CD garbage/NN can/MD in/IN the/DT dining/JJ area/NN was/VBD overflowing/VBG with/IN food/NN bits/NNS and/CC dozens/NNS of/IN fruit/JJ flies/NNS ,/, so/RB when/WRB we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO leave/VB (/NN about/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS after/IN my/PRP$ food/NN came/VBD )/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO take/VB mine/NN to/TO go/VB ,/, but/CC then/RB my/VBD friends/NNS had/VBD to/TO just/RB set/VB their/PRP$ garbage/NN next/IN to/TO the/DT overflowing/NN trashcan/NN because/IN there/EX were/VBD no/DT employees/NNS in/IN sight/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT parking/NN lot/NN and/CC surrounding/NN area/NN was/VBD super/NN sketchy/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT catfish/NN had/VBD n't/RB have/VB tasted/VBN alright/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN would/MD have/VB only/RB gotten/VBN one/CD star/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD talking/VBG about/IN this/DT place/NN and/CC we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO get/VB a/DT quick/JJ take/NN out/RP order/NN for/IN lunch/NN ./.
He/PRP had/VBD n't/RB been/VBN here/RB in/IN years/NNS and/CC I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN here/RB ever/RB so/IN we/PRP headed/VBD out/RP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD curious/JJ because/IN it/PRP was/VBD on/IN Man/NNP vs./NNP Food/NNP and/CC if/IN Adam/NNP liked/VBD why/NNS should/MD n't/RB I/VB ?/.
Inside/IN the/DT restaurant/NN I/PRP saw/VBD pictures/NNS of/IN celebrities/NNS that/WDT have/VBP visited/VBN which/WDT included/VBD Samuel/NNP L./NNP Jackson/NNP ,/, Robin/NNP Williams/NNP and/CC other/JJ celebs/NNS hanging/VBG on/IN the/DT walls/NNS ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT po'boy/NN and/CC chicken/rib/NN dinner/NN ./.
The/DT BBQ/NNP sauce/NN was/VBD tasty/JJ with/IN initial/JJ sweet/NN and/CC then/RB hot/VB tones/NNS ,/, slightly/RB delayed/VBN ./.
As/IN you/PRP get/VB more/JJR into/IN the/DT meal/JJ the/DT heat/NN starts/NNS to/TO build/VB up/RP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ and/CC probably/RB the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN it/PRP all/DT ./.
The/DT same/JJ sauce/NN was/VBD used/VBN on/IN basically/RB everything/NN that/IN is/VBZ served/VBN there/RB ./.
The/DT po'boy/NN was/VBD a/DT mess/NN so/IN I/PRP used/VBP knife/JJ and/CC fork/JJ to/TO eat/NN this/DT ./.
The/DT sausage/NN reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN polish/NNS kielbasi/IN which/WDT had/VBD snap/NN and/CC nice/JJ flavor/NN ./.
