We/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT bruschetta/NN with/IN feta/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD an/DT average/JJ size/NN portion/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT chicken/NN parm/NN with/IN extra/JJ spice/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
The/DT server/NN even/RB brought/VBD a/DT dish/JJ of/IN oil/NN peppers/NNS and/CC spices/NNS to/TO the/DT table/JJ so/IN I/PRP could/MD add/VB more/RBR if/IN wanted/CD ./.
My/NNP date/NNP had/VBD the/DT linguini/NN and/CC meatballs/NNS ./.
She/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD well/RB done/VBN and/CC tasted/VBN good/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD very/RB empty/JJ for/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN at/IN 630/CD as/IN we/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/RB ones/JJ there/RB ./.
The/DT server/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC very/RB polite/JJ ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB checking/NN this/DT place/NN out/IN on/IN Main/NNP Street/NNP Unionville/NNP ./.
There/EX is/VBZ free/JJ parking/NN behind/IN the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC easy/JJ access/NN to/TO the/DT door/NN and/CC patio/NN at/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
ugh/JJ ./.
Terrible/JJ ./.
Worst/NNP restaurant/VBD in/IN Markham/NNP and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ saying/VBG something/NN ./.
We/PRP ate/VBP here/RB FOUR/NNP times/NNS //VBP gave/IN them/PRP FOUR/NNP chances/NNS //VBP and/CC it/PRP got/VBD worse/JJ each/DT time/NN ./.
Terrible/JJ food/NN ,/, terribly/RB high/JJ prices/NNS ,/, terrible/JJ asshole/NN staff/NN and/CC owners/NNS ./.
Avoid/JJ at/IN all/DT costs/NNS ./.
How/NNP do/VBP I/PRP give/VBP zero/JJ stars/NNS -/NN is/VBZ that/IN possible/JJ ?/NNS ?/VBP ?/. ?/.
?/.
Ate/NNP there/EX last/JJ summer/NN ./.
What/WP a/DT huge/JJ disappointment/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ dusty/NN and/CC very/RB dated/VBD ./.
The/DT waitress/NN screwed/VBD up/RP our/PRP$ order/NN ,/, I/PRP ordered/MD veal/VB and/CC received/VB chicken/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, I/PRP swear/VB it/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT michelina/NN frozen/NN entree/NN ./.
Really/RB for/IN over/IN $/$ 22.00/CD ,/, I/PRP should/MD be/VB getting/VBG fresh/JJ homemade/NN pasta/NN ,/, not/RB the/DT crap/NN I/PRP was/VBD served/VBN ,/, it/PRP barely/RB filled/VBD a/DT soup/JJ cup/NN ./.
Really/RB bad/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/VB ./.
Never/NNP been/NNP back/RB ,/, and/CC never/RB going/VBG back/RB ./.
Stay/NNP away/NNP ./.
By/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, comping/VBG a/DT free/JJ pour/NN drink/NN does/VBZ n't/RB impress/NN when/WRB your/JJ food/NN is/VBZ crap/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN it/PRP a/DT half/NN star/NN if/IN such/JJ an/DT option/NN exists/NNS ./.
Slow/NNP service/NN ,/, bad/JJ hygiene/NN ,/, crappy/JJ food/NN ,/, all/PDT the/DT bad/JJ things/NNS you/PRP can/MD think/VB of/IN ./.
Stay/NNP away/VBD from/IN this/DT place/NN when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP in/IN unionville/JJ village/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN was/VBD empty/JJ except/NN for/IN our/PRP$ party/NN of/IN 12/CD ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD Super/NNP Bowl/NNP Sunday/NNP so/IN I/PRP 'll/MD assume/VB most/RBS restaurants/NNS are/VBP fairly/RB empty/JJ on/IN this/DT day/NN ./.
I/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB surprised/VBN if/IN it/PRP was/VBD this/DT empty/NN all/PDT the/DT time/NN though/IN ,/, because/IN this/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB an/DT overpriced/VBN tourist/NN trap/NN with/IN crappy/JJ food/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBZ its/PRP$ to/TO be/VB expected/VBN that/IN the/DT restaurants/NNS in/IN Unionville/NNP are/VBP tourist/JJ traps/NNS ,/, as/IN Main/NNP St/NNP is/VBZ a/DT mini/NN Niagara/NN on/IN the/DT Lake/NNP wannabe/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBD the/DT $/$ 30/CD prix/NN fixe/NN course/NN ,/, with/IN roasted/VBN portobello/NN ,/, chicken/VBN valdostana/NN and/CC tiramisu/NN ./.
First/NNP ,/, the/DT bread/JJ ./.
The/DT bread/JJ came/VBD out/RP cold/NN and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT cheap/NN baguette/NN from/IN No/DT Frills/NNS ./.
The/DT garlic/NN butter/NN that/IN it/PRP came/VBD with/IN was/VBD nothing/VBN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN much/JJ yummier/NN warm/NN bread/JJ with/IN delicious/JJ spreads/NNS from/IN many/JJ Italian/JJ places/NNS ,/, so/RB this/DT was/VBD a/DT big/JJ disappointment/NN ./.
The/DT portobello/NN was/VBD a/DT meh/NN .../: a/DT little/JJ bit/NN dry/NN ,/, OK/NNP flavour/NNP ,/, vegetables/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN a/DT bit/NN overcooked/VBN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP made/VBN much/JJ better/NN portobello/NN myself/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD just/RB nasty/JJ and/CC unappetizing/JJ with/IN some/DT overly/RB salty/JJ ``/`` wine/NN sauce/NN ''/'' that/IN tasted/VBN like/IN soya/NN sauce/NN and/CC made/VBD the/DT dish/JJ difficult/NN to/TO consume/NN ./.
The/DT chicken/NN valdostana/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT piece/NN of/IN chicken/NN with/IN a/DT ham/NN on/IN top/JJ coated/VBN with/IN cheese/NN ,/, so/IN you/PRP can/MD imagine/VB the/DT saltiness/NN of/IN ham/NN +/NN soya/NN ``/`` wine/NN ''/'' sauce/NN =/IN really/RB salty/NN ./.
The/DT dish/JJ was/VBD served/VBN with/IN the/DT same/JJ wilted/VBN overcooked/VBN veggies/NNS and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN tasteless/NN crumbling/VBG slices/NNS of/IN potatoes/NNS ./.
The/DT tiramisu/NN was/VBD the/DT worst/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP tasted/VBD like/IN some/DT stale/NN dessert/NN I/PRP would/MD find/VB at/IN a/DT cheap/NN Chinese/JJ buffet/NN rather/RB than/IN an/DT ``/`` upscale/JJ ''/'' restaurant/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP tiramisu/JJ ,/, and/CC usually/RB eat/JJ everything/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP could/MD just/RB not/RB bring/VB myself/JJ to/TO finish/JJ dessert/NN ./.
The/DT overall/JJ mood/NN after/IN consumption/NN from/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN my/PRP$ party/NN was/VBD ``/`` unimpressed/JJ ''/'' ,/, so/IN it/PRP probably/RB was/VBD n't/RB just/RB me/VB ./.
Like/IN a/DT previous/JJ reviewer/NN stated/VBD ,/, I/PRP really/RB felt/VBD like/IN this/DT was/VBD next/JJ on/IN the/DT list/NN for/IN Kitchen/NNP Nightmares/NNPS ./.
The/DT owner/NN tries/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO entertain/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB hospitable/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ simply/RB horrible/JJ and/CC there/EX are/VBP much/JJ better/NN options/NNS for/IN the/DT prices/NNS they/PRP demand/RB ./.
Never/NNP coming/VBD back/RB here/RB again/RB !/.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ atrocious/JJ ,/, I/PRP would/MD not/RB recommend/VB anyone/NN dining/NN here/RB ./.
First/NNP off/NNP ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD n't/RB that/IN busy/NN but/CC I/PRP still/RB had/VBD to/TO wait/NN to/TO be/VB seated/VBN ,/, secondly/RB ,/, the/DT level/NN of/IN hygiene/NN in/IN this/DT place/NN was/VBD disgusting/VBG ./.
The/DT glass/NN of/IN water/NN I/PRP was/VBD served/VBN had/VBD green/VBN particles/NNS of/IN something/NN floating/VBG in/IN it/PRP ,/, yuck/JJ !/.
So/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB drinking/VBG out/IN of/IN that/DT glass/NN ./.
My/NNP utensils/VBZ the/DT spoon/NN had/VBD leftover/NN particles/NNS on/IN it/PRP as/RB well/RB so/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB using/VBN that/IN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT gnocchi/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB a/DT small/JJ portion/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ over-priced/JJ ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ so/RB dark/JJ inside/NN too/RB ,/, bad/JJ lighting/NN ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD slow/JJ ,/, they/PRP took/VBD so/RB long/RB to/TO get/VB my/JJ food/NN to/TO me/PRP that/IN the/DT waiter/NN even/RB came/VBD up/IN to/TO me/NN and/CC said/VBD ``/`` Do/NNP n't/RB worry/VB we/PRP have/VBP n't/RB forgotten/VBN about/IN you/PRP sir/VBP !/VBN ``/`` ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP done/VBG !/.
We/PRP went/VBD here/RB on/IN Mother/NNP 's/POS Day/NNP this/DT year/NN ./.
Granted/NNP Mother/NNP 's/POS Day/NNP is/VBZ insane/JJ no/DT matter/NN where/WRB you/PRP go/VBP ,/, this/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD not/RB a/DT good/JJ experience/NN in/IN any/DT way/NN ./.
We/PRP made/VBD reservations/NNS beforehand/IN (/NN because/IN you/PRP needed/VBD to/TO )/NNP and/CC yet/NNP when/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD no/DT one/CD talked/JJ to/TO us/PRP and/CC just/RB kept/VBD running/VBG past/NN us/PRP ./.
When/WRB we/PRP finally/RB stopped/VBD someone/NN and/CC said/VBD we/PRP had/VBD reservations/NNS he/PRP looked/VBD down/RP at/IN the/DT table/JJ seating/NN and/CC pointed/VBN with/IN his/PRP$ head/NN where/WRB our/PRP$ table/JJ was/VBD ./.
We/PRP were/VBD n't/RB entirely/RB sure/JJ and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT other/JJ wait/NN staff/NN (/VBD a/DT young/JJ girl/NN )/NN doubled/VBD checked/VBN to/TO make/VB sure/JJ ./.
She/PRP apologized/VBD and/CC was/VBD probably/RB the/DT only/JJ person/NN who/WP knew/NN proper/NN restaurant/NN service/NN and/CC knew/NN how/WRB to/TO run/VB the/DT place/NN ./.
We/PRP were/VBD placed/VBN right/RB in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT patio/NN door/NN and/CC squished/VBD between/IN two/CD other/JJ large/JJ groups/NNS .../: ./.
Sorry/JJ but/CC if/IN we/PRP made/VBP reservations/NNS and/CC so/RB did/VBD the/DT other/JJ people/NNS you/PRP should/MD make/VB sure/JJ you/PRP have/VBP enough/RB floor/JJ space/NN to/TO seat/NN all/DT of/IN these/DT people/NNS ./.
2/JJ people/NNS from/IN my/JJ party/NN of/IN 5/NN had/VBD to/TO stand/VB up/RP at/IN least/JJS 8/CD times/NNS during/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN to/TO let/VB people/NNS pass/NNS because/IN there/EX was/VBD not/RB enough/RB room/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB MEH/RB .../: ./. NOT/NNP worth/VBD the/DT price/NN ./.
We/PRP joked/VBD that/IN their/PRP$ 'soup/NN of/IN the/DT day/NNS '/POS tasted/VBN like/IN Campbell/NNP 's/POS canned/VBN tomato/NN soup/NN ./.
Aside/RB from/IN their/PRP$ tiramisu/NN tasting/VBG good/JJ everything/NN else/NN was/VBD not/RB that/IN good/JJ ./.
Lastly/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD surprised/VBN to/TO see/VB the/DT price/NN was/VBD NOT/NNP the/DT same/NN for/IN their/PRP$ price/NN fixed/NNS menu/NN from/IN their/PRP$ website/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD more/RBR expensive/JJ when/WRB we/PRP arrived/VBD and/CC sat/JJ down/NNS ./.
I/PRP would/MD never/RB go/VB back/RB and/CC will/MD definitely/RB not/RB recommend/VB this/DT place/NN to/TO anyone/NN ./.
This/DT place/NN tries/NNS ,/, very/RB hard/JJ ,/, to/TO be/VB an/DT upscale/JJ Italian/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, but/CC fails/NNS ,/, equally/RB as/IN hard/JJ ,/, in/IN doing/NN so/RB ./.
The/DT location/NN for/IN a/DT restaurant/NN like/IN this/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB better/RBR ./.
You/PRP would/MD think/VB that/IN the/DT ownership/NN who/WP are/VBP paying/VBG thousands/NNS to/TO have/VB this/DT location/NN would/MD capitalize/VB on/IN this/DT but/NN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ./.

I/PRP had/VBD dinner/NN here/RB last/JJ night/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD recommended/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ cousin/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN decor/NN is/VBZ nice/RB and/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN patio/NN space/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, for/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP night/NN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD really/RB quiet/JJ ./.
The/DT whole/JJ time/NN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, there/EX were/VBD only/RB 4/CD other/JJ tables/NNS ./.
One/CD of/IN which/WDT left/NN after/IN being/VBG seating/VBG for/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT family/NN of/IN 5/NN and/CC I/PRP imagine/VBP it/PRP was/VBD because/IN the/DT menu/NN was/VBD suited/VBN for/IN their/PRP$ children/NNS ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ pricey/NN ,/, in/IN an/DT around/IN $/$ 22-30/CD for/IN a/DT main/JJ ./.
My/NNP friend/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO do/VB the/DT price/NN fix/NN menu/NN based/VBN on/IN this/DT ./.
For/IN $/$ 30/CD or/CC $/$ 40/CD ,/, you/PRP can/MD get/VB an/DT appetizer/NN ,/, entree/NN and/CC dessert/NN ./.
We/PRP both/VBP had/VBD the/DT soup/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN which/WDT was/VBD asparagus/RB cream/NN soup/NN which/WDT was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB heard/NN of/IN it/PRP or/CC had/VBD it/PRP ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB delicious/JJ ./.
We/PRP then/RB shared/VBD the/DT beef/NN tenderloin/NN spaghetti/NN and/CC chicken/NN cutlet/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN veggies/NNS ./.
The/DT entree/NN was/VBD alright/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP only/RB had/VBD 2/VBN selections/NNS for/IN dessert/NN ./.

We/PRP tried/VBD both/DT and/CC they/PRP were/VBD alright/RB ./.
The/DT tiramisu/NN I/PRP found/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/NN sweet/NN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN was/VBD lovely/RB and/CC I/PRP imagine/VBP they/PRP are/VBP busier/NN in/IN the/DT summer/JJ time/NN ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN my/PRP$ cousins/NNS bridal/JJ shower/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP afternoon/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB too/RB upset/JJ considering/VBG I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB come/VB here/RB for/IN dinner/NN and/CC was/VBD not/RB paying/VBG for/IN a/DT meal/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP was/VBD saying/VBG .../: our/PRP$ experience/NN after/IN that/DT was/VBD horrid/JJ ./.

At/IN which/WDT point/NN he/PRP turned/VBD around/IN and/CC walked/VBD away/RB and/CC apparently/RB did/VBD n't/RB care/VB that/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB enjoying/JJ this/DT experience/NN ./.
On/IN our/PRP$ way/NN out/IN ,/, I/PRP stopped/VBP and/CC asked/VBD the/DT barkeep/NN if/IN that/DT was/VBD the/DT OWNER/NNP ,/, just/RB in/IN case/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT stressed/VBN employee/NN that/IN the/DT OWNER/NNP should/MD know/VB about/IN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD reluctantly/RB informed/VBN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD I/PRP fact/VBP the/DT OWNER/NNP that/IN had/VBD treated/VBN us/PRP so/RB rudely/RB ./.
It/PRP must/MD be/VB nice/JJ to/TO have/VB so/RB much/RB business/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD irritate/VB paying/JJ customers/NNS to/TO the/DT point/NN of/IN leaving/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB went/VBD down/IN the/DT road/NN to/TO the/DT Blacksmith/NNP and/CC had/VBD a/DT wonderful/JJ last/JJ minute/NN dinner/NN ./.
We/PRP spent/VBD $/$ 300/CD there/EX that/IN night/NN and/CC will/MD be/VB back/RB to/TO the/DT Blacksmith/NNP again/RB ./.
Needless/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, we/PRP will/MD never/RB be/VB back/RB to/TO La/NNP Grotta/NNP again/NNP !/.

Food/NNP gets/VBZ 4/JJ stars/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
But/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD atrocious/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD often/RB sitting/JJ there/EX waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT server/NN to/TO return/NN ./.
Waited/NNP for/IN 20/CD mins/NNS after/IN completing/VBG our/NNS meals/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ desserts/NNS ,/, and/CC no/DT server/NN in/IN sight/NN ./.
After/IN dessert/NN ,/, waited/VBD another/DT 20/NN mins/NNS to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ bill/NN ./.
The/DT wait/NN times/NNS were/VBD ridiculous/JJ ,/, but/CC like/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, the/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB returning/VBG though/IN ./.
One/CD of/IN my/PRP$ biggest/JJS pet/NN peeves/NNS is/VBZ waiting/VBG and/CC not/RB being/VBG served/VBN for/IN a/DT prolonged/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN
Came/NN here/RB with/IN 6/CD girls/NNS out/IN on/IN a/DT whim/JJ ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, service/NN as/IN excellent/JJ ./.
Gluten/NNP free/NNP pasta/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG and/CC their/PRP$ pizza/NN was/VBD tasty/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN were/VBD very/RB Funny/JJ ,/, friendly/RB and/CC sweet/JJ ./.
Found/IN it/PRP a/DT little/JJ odd/NN that/IN there/NNS were/VBD only/RB 3/JJ other/JJ occupied/JJ tables/NNS on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN but/CC apparently/RB their/PRP$ busy/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN with/IN the/DT patio/NN ./.
All/DT of/IN us/PRP decided/VBD we/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB :/: )/.
I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP can/MD give/VB 0/-NONE- stars/NNS ./.
Super/NNP slow/VBD service/NN !/.
Mussels/NNS are/VBP not/RB fresh/JJ !/.
Ca/NNP n't/RB think/NN of/IN one/CD thing/NN that/IN is/VBZ gd/VBN abt/RB this/DT place/NN !/.
Do/NNP not/RB come/VB !/RB !/.

Had/NNP dinner/NN here/RB on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN couple/NN weeks/NNS ago/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD empty/JJ there/NN was/VBD only/RB 3/RB tables/NNS there/EX before/IN us/PRP and/CC they/PRP were/VBD all/DT out/NNS on/IN the/DT patio/NN so/IN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO join/VB them/PRP as/IN we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO be/VB the/DT only/RB ones/JJ indoors/NNS ./.
I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP odd/VBD when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD getting/VBG seated/VBN he/PRP asked/VBD us/PRP if/IN we/PRP had/VBD any/DT coupons/NNS and/CC pulled/VBD out/RP some/DT menu/NN from/IN the/DT back/NN when/WRB we/PRP said/VBD no/DT ./.
I/PRP noticed/VBD everyone/NN that/IN came/NN after/IN us/PRP had/VBD a/DT different/JJ menu/NN than/IN what/WP we/PRP got/VBP ;/: apparently/RB they/PRP had/VBD some/DT sort/NN of/IN coupon/NN from/IN like/IN groupon/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN they/PRP got/VBD had/VBD limited/VBN choices/NNS ./.
That/DT did/VBD n't/RB sound/VB honest/NN as/IN they/PRP can/MD only/RB order/VB for/IN a/DT fix/NN menu/NN and/CC the/DT portions/NNS apparently/RB smaller/JJR which/WDT I/PRP could/MD n't/RB confirm/VB directly/RB ./.
I/PRP spoke/VBP to/TO the/DT couple/NN beside/NN us/PRP and/CC they/PRP told/VBD us/PRP that/IN the/DT coupon/NN never/RB said/VBD they/PRP had/VBD to/TO order/NN from/IN a/DT special/JJ menu/NN so/IN they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB pleased/VBN as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT regular/JJ portion/NN is/VBZ already/RB quite/JJ small/JJ and/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB imagine/VB it/PRP being/VBG any/DT smaller/NN ./.
The/DT decor/NN at/IN La/NNP Grotta/NNP is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC would/MD attract/VB the/DT tourist/NN here/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT pricey/NN side/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN quality/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/DT good/JJ as/IN the/DT veal/NN I/PRP got/VBD was/VBD n't/RB even/RB hot/VB and/CC quite/JJ dry/NN ./.
It/PRP just/RB looks/VBZ like/IN the/DT heated/VBN up/RP the/DT pasta/NN sauce/NN and/CC pour/VB it/PRP on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT veal/NN to/TO heat/VB it/PRP up/IN and/CC added/VBD some/DT cheese/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB I/PRP would/MD return/VB here/RB as/IN there/NNS are/VBP better/VBG options/NNS on/IN Main/NNP ./.
Rating/VBG :/: Service/NNS :/: 2/5/CD Food/NNP Quality/NN :/: 3/5/CD Comfort/NNP 2/5/CD Decor/NNP 5/5/CD Value/NN :/: 2/5/CD Parking/NN :/: 3/5/CD
Unlike/IN other/JJ people/NNS 's/POS experience/NN ,/, my/PRP$ fiancé/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT lovely/RB time/NN at/IN La/NNP Grotta/NNP ./.
The/DT owner/NN was/VBD actually/RB quite/JJ friendly/RB and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
He/PRP made/VBD some/DT good/JJ suggestions/NNS and/CC eventually/RB we/PRP selected/VBD the/DT risotto/NN with/IN mushroom/NN ,/, chicken/NN and/CC sundried/VBD tomatoes/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
Best/NNP risotto/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
Quite/RB a/DT good/JJ selection/NN of/IN wine/NN ./.
As/IN per/IN other/JJ people/NNS 's/POS experience/NN ,/, I/PRP could/MD see/VB where/WRB the/DT owner/NN could/MD become/VB flustered/VBN ./.
However/RB ,/, nice/JJ people/NNS get/VBP treated/VBN nicely/RB ;/: simply/RB stated/VBN but/CC true/JJ ./.
The/DT ambiance/NN was/VBD n't/RB the/DT greatest/NN and/CC I/PRP did/VBD make/VB a/DT joke/NN that/IN this/DT restaurant/NN should/MD be/VB on/IN kitchen/NN nightmares/NNS ./.
Not/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT space/NN ./.
With/IN little/JJ changes/NNS I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ La/NN Grotta/NNP can/MD be/VB an/DT awesome/NN restaurant/NN for/IN everyone/NN to/TO enjoy/VB in/IN Unionville/NNP ./.
P.S/NNS :/: if/IN you/PRP like/VBP spices/NNS ,/, try/VBD the/DT owners/NNS special/VBP chillies/NNS in/IN olive/JJ oil/NN .../: AMAZING/NNP !/.
