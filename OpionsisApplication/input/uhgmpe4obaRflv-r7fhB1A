Food/NNP is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC pretty/RB healthy/JJ depending/VBG on/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP ./.
My/NNP husband/NN did/VBD n't/RB have/VB a/DT good/JJ experience/NN when/WRB he/PRP dined/VBD in/IN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN but/CC has/VBZ since/RB changed/VBN his/PRP$ mind/NN once/RB I/PRP ordered/VBP for/IN him/PRP ./.

You/PRP can/MD certainly/RB tell/VB that/IN the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ still/RB figuring/VBG out/RP things/NNS but/CC they/PRP have/VBP great/VBN customer/NN service/NN so/IN I/PRP think/VBP this/DT place/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT neighborhood/NN favorite/JJ !/.
They/PRP are/VBP also/RB working/VBG on/IN getting/VBG their/PRP$ liquor/NN license-/NN nothing/NN better/NNS with/IN sushi/NN than/IN an/DT ice/NN cold/NN beer/NN !/.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD great/JJ !/.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO say/VB thank/NN you/PRP to/TO Brittany/NNP and/CC Shane/NNP keep/VBD up/RP the/DT great/JJ work/NN !/.
My/NNP bowl/NN was/VBD mediocre-/JJ I/PRP got/VBD the/DT surf/NN and/CC turf/NN bowl/NN ./.
The/DT bowl/NN had/VBD more/RBR rice/JJ than/IN anything/NN ./.
Minimal/NNP meat/NN ./.
Stopped/NNP in/IN to/TO what/WP the/DT hype/NN was/VBD about/RB ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
We/PRP had/VBD 2/VBN Poke/NNP bowls/NNS ./.

The/DT girls/NNS at/IN the/DT front/NNS were/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
Great/NNP clean/JJ place/NN ./.
Really/RB was/VBD more/RBR 4.5/CD ./.
First/NNP thing/VBD the/DT girl/NN could/MD not/RB get/VB our/PRP$ order/NN right/NN ./.
Second/NNP food/NN took/VBD 28/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB with/IN total/NN of/IN 8/CD ppl/NN in/IN restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT steak/JJ Bento/NNP was/VBD cold/JJ and/CC recooked/JJ ,/, nothing/NN fresh/NN about/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT spring/NN roll/NN was/VBD disgusting/VBG ./.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO share/NN utensils/NNS they/PRP just/RB ignore/VBP us/PRP after/IN complaining/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP still/RB sitting/VBG here/RB an/DT hour/NN later/JJ wait/NN for/IN refund/NN for/IN food/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB order/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ good../VBN the/DT pricing/NN is/VBZ equal/JJ to/TO that/DT of/IN chipotle/NN ,/, if/IN that/DT 's/VBZ your/JJ thing/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT service/NN ?/NN ?/. ?/.
Oh/NNP my/NNP goodness../NN
I/PRP could/MD have/VB grown/VBN the/DT ingredients/NNS it/PRP took/VBD to/TO make/VB the/DT food/NN faster/JJR than/IN it/PRP took/VBD to/TO serve/VB someone/NN ./.
I/PRP waited/VBD for/IN 30/CD minutes/NNS for/IN my/NN food../NN
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT regular/JJ bowl/NN ,/, nothing/NN crazy/NN ./.
How/NNP is/VBZ that/IN even/RB possible/JJ ?/NN ?/. ?/.
Well/NNP I/PRP started/VBP looking/VBG at/IN the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO see/VB how/WRB that/DT was/VBD possible/JJ and/CC I/PRP came/VBD to/TO the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT pep/NN in/IN anyone/NN 's/POS step/NN ./.
They/PRP move/VBP like/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB much/JJ to/TO accomplish/VB for/IN the/DT day/NN ./.
The/DT cashier/NN was/VBD not/RB really/RB friendly/RB and/CC the/DT looks/NNS on/IN everyones/NNS face/NN is/VBZ so/RB unpleasant/JJ ./.

The/DT lady/NN was/VBD apologetic/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/RB this/DT has/VBZ 2/CD stars/NNS instead/RB of/IN 1/CD ./. )/''
We/PRP ordered/VBP extra/JJ GF/NNP teriyaki/NNP Sauce/NNP and/CC my/NNP husband/NN finally/RB got/VBD home/NN with/IN our/PRP$ dinners/NNS and/CC there/EX was/VBD extra/JJ Sauce/NN but/CC not/RB the/DT GF/NNP one/CD ./.

The/DT steak/NN was/VBD dry/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB recommend/VB going/JJ here/RB until/IN they/PRP get/VBP the/DT hang/NN of/IN things/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN other/JJ locations/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB these/DT problems/NNS so/RB maybe/RB this/DT is/VBZ because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP new/JJ but/CC they/PRP 've/VBP lost/VBN our/JJ business/NN ./.

They/PRP mean/VBP it/PRP !/.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO admit/VB that/IN the/DT night/NN we/PRP went/VBD ,/, there/EX was/VBD a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ rainstorm/NN coming/VBG down/IN ./.
That/DT did/VBD n't/RB stop/VB folks/NNS from/IN coming/VBG in/IN ./.
Since/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO watch/JJ carbs/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD REALLY/NNP easy/CD to/TO customize/VB my/JJ box/NN for/IN that/DT ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD comfortable/JJ and/CC well/RB appointed/VBD to/TO the/DT theme/NN of/IN modern/JJ Asian/NN ./.

This/DT little/JJ gem/NN opened/VBD up/RP last/JJ month/NN &/CC I/PRP finally/RB made/VBD it/PRP &/CC was/VBD n't/RB disappointed/JJ in/IN the/DT least/NN ./.

However/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ catching/VBG up/RP a/DT bit/NN at/IN least/JJS chain/NN wise/NN on/IN the/DT food/NN options/NNS ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB wait/VB to/TO get/VB back/NNP &/CC try/NNP another/NNP poke/NN bowl/NN option/NN ./.
Hubs/NNP had/VBD the/DT bento/NN box/NN &/CC liked/VBD it/PRP too/RB ./.
Pretty/NNP big/JJ portions/NNS of/IN everything/NN ./.

!/NN
So/IN the/DT food/NN was/VBD just/RB alright/JJ for/IN my/PRP$ boyfriend/NN and/CC myself/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP Genghis/NNP Grill/NNP has/VBZ better/VBN noodle/JJ combinations/NNS ./.
The/DT sushi/NN was/VBD very/RB plain/NN and/CC overpriced/VBN ./.
My/NNP daughter/NN loved/VBD her/PRP bento/NN box/NN and/CC it/PRP had/VBD the/DT right/JJ amount/NN of/IN food/NN for/IN her/PRP which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ getting/VBG three/CD stars/NNS ./.
The/DT staff/NN was/VBD not/RB helpful/JJ and/CC when/WRB we/PRP asked/VBP for/IN additional/JJ serving/VBG items/NNS they/PRP never/RB came/VBD to/TO deliver/VB them/PRP ./.
This/DT place/NN was/VBD decent/JJ .../: probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB come/VB again/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD literally/RB 2/VBN pieces/NNS of/IN broccoli/NN in/IN my/PRP$ bowl/NN ./.
The/DT girl/NN at/IN the/DT counter/NN did/VBD n't/RB really/RB seem/VB to/TO enjoy/VB anyone/NN 's/POS company/NN ./.
Heard/NNP great/VBD things/NNS about/IN this/DT place/NN but/CC when/WRB we/PRP ordered/VBP our/JJ food/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD brought/VBN to/TO us/VB the/DT dish/JJ was/VBD mainly/RB rice/JJ ,/, had/VBD way/VBN to/TO much/JJ sauce/NN and/CC had/VBD an/DT eye/JJ lash/NN or/CC some/DT sort/NN of/IN hair/NN in/IN the/DT bowl/NN ./.
The/DT line/NN was/VBD way/NN to/TO long/JJ to/TO complain/VB so/IN it/PRP turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT waste/NN of/IN money/NN ./.
***Update/RB review/JJ as/IN of/IN March/NNP 10/CD 2017***/CD the/DT manager/NN of/IN this/DT location/NN reached/VBD out/RP and/CC made/VBD things/JJ right/NN ./.
We/PRP gave/VBD this/DT place/NN a/DT second/JJ try/NN this/DT afternoon/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT lot/NN better/RBR ./.
Good/NNP portion/NN of/IN meat/NN ,/, rice/NN and/CC veggies/NNS ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP getting/VBG the/DT salmon/NN and/CC steak/JJ which/NNS were/VBD both/DT cooked/VBN perfectly/RB !/.
great/JJ food/NN and/CC fast/NN service/NN ./.
i/NN will/MD totally/RB be/VB back/RB
Went/NNP here/RB with/IN my/NNP family/NN for/IN lunch/NN ,/, We/PRP checked/VBD out/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN before/IN ordering/VBG ./.
Walked/NNP to/TO the/DT front/NN counter/NN and/CC the/DT white/JJ chick/NN that/WDT was/VBD taking/VBG our/PRP$ order/NN did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB friendly/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
When/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD her/PRP what/WP was/VBD in/IN the/DT side/NN salad/RB ,/, she/PRP struggled/VBD to/TO tell/NN me/NNS ./.
So/IN I/PRP cut/VBD her/PRP off/RP after/IN she/PRP listed/VBD the/DT 2nd/CD ingredient/NN and/CC said/VBD nvm/NN bc/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO wait/VB 5/JJ mins/NNS for/IN her/PRP to/TO figure/VB it/PRP out/IN in/IN case/NN she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB ./.
Soooo/NNP If/IN your/PRP$ the/DT first/JJ person/NN everyone/NN approaches/NNS ,/, you/PRP should/MD Sorta/VB know/VB your/PRP$ menu/NN in/IN case/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ whatever/JJR ./.
Anyways/NNS ,/, Fiancé/NNP got/VBD the/DT joes/NNS original/JJ bowl/NN which/WDT came/VBD chicken/NN ,/, teriyaki/NNP sauce/NN ,/, rice/NN and/CC steam/NN veggies/NNS ./.
I/PRP got/VBD myself/NN a/DT bento/NN box/NN and/CC my/PRP$ son/NN too/RB ./.
We/PRP were/VBD enjoying/VBG our/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
Everything/NNP tasted/VBD fine/NN except/IN rice/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN hard/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD edible/JJ ./.
So/IN both/DT of/IN us/PRP was/VBD satisfy/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN ./.
Then/RB the/DT worst/NN part/NN ,/, got/VBD into/IN our/PRP$ car/NN to/TO get/VB some/DT boba/NN at/IN TeaBo/NNP ``/`` check/NN them/PRP out/RP ,/, delicious/JJ food/NN &/CC drinks/NNS ''/'' anyways/NNS we/PRP was/VBD driving/VBG to/TO the/DT boba/NN place/NN and/CC I/PRP began/VBD to/TO feel/VB so/RB weird/JJ like/IN I/PRP was/VBD high/JJ or/CC drug/NN ./.
Felt/NNP so/RB light/JJ headed/VBN and/CC stomach/NN was/VBD acting/VBG up/RB ./.
Idk/NNP what/NNP happen/NN ,/, but/CC something/NN did/VBD n't/RB feel/VB right/NN ./.
So/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP def/JJ staying/JJ away/NN from/IN that/DT place/NN ./.
Felt/NNP much/RB better/JJR after/IN I/PRP got/VBD home/NN ./.
Not/RB trying/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT rude/NN reviewer/NN but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB stating/VBG the/DT truth/NN and/CC my/NN experience/NN for/IN others/NNS to/TO know/VB before/IN going/NN ./.
I/PRP never/VBP ever/RB get/VB sick/NN from/IN food/NN ./.
Very/NNP rare/NN ./.

Anyways/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT cute/JJ place/NN and/CC all/DT ./.
the/DT food/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC i/RB swear/JJ they/PRP are/VBP killing/VBG the/DT chicken/NN &/CC plucking/VBG it/PRP in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN or/CC something/NN because/IN both/DT times/NNS we/PRP 've/VBP come/VBN here/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ taken/VBN FOREVER/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP figured/VBD it/PRP was/VBD just/RB because/IN they/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB busy/JJ ,/, but/CC today/NN it/PRP took/VBD 51/NN mins/NNS before/IN we/PRP got/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN !/.
Thats/VBZ a/DT longer/JJR wait/NN than/IN a/DT normal/JJ restaurant/NN !/.
Hopefully/RB in/IN the/DT future/JJ they/PRP can/MD get/VB their/PRP$ prep/NN times/NNS down/RB ,/, because/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT place/NN like/IN this/DT !/NN
I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB been/VBN here/RB twice/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD take-out/JJ both/DT times/NNS ./.

One/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorites/NNS when/WRB in/IN Colorado/NNP so/IN I/PRP am/VBP so/RB happy/JJ to/TO see/VB one/CD in/IN my/PRP$ neighborhood/NN ./.

Staff/NNP was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
Food/NNP lived/VBD up/RP to/TO what/WP I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN before/IN ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
I/PRP come/VBP here/RB a/DT lot/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC there/EX 's/VBZ always/RB a/DT problem/NN here/RB and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT employees/NNS ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN I/PRP can/MD see/VB it/PRP the/DT only/RB hard/JJ working/JJ people/NNS are/VBP the/DT chefs/NNS and/CC other/JJ than/IN that/IN I/PRP get/VBP this/DT constant/NN attitude/NN and/CC ignorance/NN from/IN everyone/NN else/RB ./.
The/DT girls/NNS taking/VBP my/PRP$ order/NN are/VBP never/RB helpful/JJ and/CC they/PRP just/RB respond/VBP in/IN very/RB vague/JJ responses/NNS ./.
They/PRP seem/VBP to/TO have/VB no/DT knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT different/JJ foods/NNS they/PRP sell/VBP here/RB ./.
Today/NN specifically/RB I/PRP witnessed/VBD
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP lacking/VBG in/IN customer/NN service/NN ./.
I/PRP waited/VBD in/IN line/NN for/IN about/IN 10/CD min/NN and/CC waited/VBD 10/CD minutes/NNS for/IN my/JJ food/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD during/IN lunch/NN hour/NN ,/, so/IN they/PRP should/MD have/VB more/RBR then/RB 1/CD person/NN at/IN the/DT register/NN ./.
The/DT lady/NN at/IN the/DT register/NN (/NN did/VBD n't/RB catch/VB her/PRP name/RB because/IN she/PRP had/VBD a/DT jacket/NN on/IN )/NN was/VBD n't/RB friendly/RB at/IN all/DT ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/VBN she/PRP looked/VBD like/IN she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO be/VB there/RB .../: ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT bento/NN box/NN with/IN teriyaki/NNP chicken/NN ,/, rice/NN ,/, edamame/NN ,/, and/CC spicy/NN tuna/NN sushi/NN !/.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD actually/RB REALLLLLYYY/RB good/JJ with/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN the/DT sushi/NN .../: it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB look/VB or/CC taste/VB fresh/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP only/RB ate/VBP 1/JJ piece/NN because/IN I/PRP was/VBD scared/JJ I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO get/VB sick/NN ,/, but/CC everything/NN else/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
I/PRP 'll/MD definitely/RB be/VB back/RB and/CC hopefully/RB they/PRP get/VBP it/PRP together/RB with/IN their/PRP$ customer/NN service/NN skills/NNS !/.
Was/NNP driving/VBG by/IN and/CC figured/VBD I/PRP 'd/MD stop/VB by/IN and/CC try/RB this/DT new/JJ place/NN ./.
Very/NNP clean/JJ establishment/NN ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP ordering/VBG a/DT Arizona/NNP Roll/NNP and/CC Texas/NNP Roll/NNP ,/, they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB have/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN sushi/NN selection/NN as/IN I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
Both/IN the/DT Arizona/NNP Roll/NNP and/CC Texas/NNP Roll/NNP were/VBD pretty/RB bland/JJ ./.
Not/RB much/JJ flavor/NN to/TO it/PRP and/CC there/EX was/VBD n't/RB really/RB any/DT meat/NN in/IN Texas/NNP Roll/NNP ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD worth/VBG the/DT price/NN of/IN $/$ 7.50/CD ./.
I/PRP would/MD of/IN given/NNP it/PRP a/DT 3/NN star/NN for/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP took/VBD a/DT long/JJ time/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT food/NN as/IN well/RB and/CC there/RB was/VBD n't/RB anyone/RB in/IN there/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP I/PRP 'll/MD give/VB it/PRP a/DT try/NN one/CD more/JJR time/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN and/CC update/VB the/DT review/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT teriyaki/NN bowl/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ as/IN there/NN was/VBD n't/RB much/JJ chicken/NN or/CC even/RB veggies/NNS ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT bowl/NN was/VBD filled/VBN with/IN rice/NN ./.
Their/NNP hibiscus/VBZ tea/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ once/RB some/DT sugar/NN was/VBD added/RB ./.
My/NNP friends/VBZ ordered/VBN a/DT sushi/NN roll/NN and/CC a/DT poke/NN bowl/NN and/CC the/DT wait/NN for/IN those/DT was/VBD pretty/RB long/RB ./.
Not/RB sure/JJ what/WP all/PDT the/DT hype/NN is/VBZ here/RB ./.
Sushi/NNP blah/NN ./.

We/PRP got/VBD our/PRP$ food/NN in/IN decent/JJ time/NN which/WDT I/PRP was/VBD worried/VBN about/IN after/IN reading/NN other/JJ reviews/NNS ./.
What/WP bothered/VBD me/PRP most/RBS was/VBD customer/JJ service/NN ./.
To/TO be/VB exact/VBN the/DT girl/NN who/WP took/VBD our/NN order/NN not/RB the/DT guy/JJ walking/NN around/IN delivering/VBG food/NN ,/, he/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ./.

At/IN first/JJ I/PRP thought/VBD maybe/JJ she/PRP is/VBZ injured/JJ and/CC has/VBZ too/RB lean/JJ ./.
Ok/IN but/CC when/WRB I/PRP watched/VBD her/PRP walk/VBP around/IN she/PRP seemed/VBD fine/NN ./.

The/DT selection/NN of/IN teas/NN was/VBD abundant/JJ and/CC I/PRP was/VBD excited/VBN to/TO taste/VB them/PRP ./.
EVERY/NNP ONE/NNP of/IN them/PRP was/VBD bitter/JJ and/CC BLAH/NNP !/.
Ended/NNP up/RP with/IN water/NN ./.
Only/IN reason/NN I/PRP gave/VBD two/CD stars/NNS was/VBD the/DT one/CD gentleman/NN that/IN delivered/JJ our/NN food/NN was/VBD nice/JJ and/CC cheerful/JJ like/IN he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO be/VB there/RB ,/, and/CC checked/VBD on/IN us/PRP And/CC food/NN was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ definitely/RB not/RB great/JJ experience/NN ./.
