Unfortunately/RB ,/, we/PRP had/VBD the/DT worst/NN server/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
She/PRP was/VBD a/DT blond/NN woman/NN with/IN glasses/NNS and/CC seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB spending/RB more/JJR time/NN socializing/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN vs./NN waiting/VBG on/IN tables/NNS ./.
Our/NNP food/NN took/VBD over/IN an/DT hour/NN and/CC even/RB then/RB one/CD entree/NN was/VBD missing/NN ./.
Never/NNP received/VBD any/DT refills/NNS on/IN our/PRP$ water/NN and/CC we/PRP also/RB made/VBD the/DT mistake/NN of/IN ordering/VBG dessert/NN .../:
The/DT dessert/NN took/VBD another/DT half/NN an/DT hour/NN and/CC our/PRP$ ice/NN cream/NN was/VBD fully/RB melted/VBN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP quite/JJ sure/JJ this/DT is/VBZ an/DT awesome/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP just/RB had/VBD the/DT worst/NN server/NN employed/VBN there/RB ./.
Hopefully/RB mgmt/JJ knows/NNS who/WP this/DT server/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN my/PRP$ description/NN ,/, they/PRP see/VBP this/DT review/NN ,/, and/CC take/VB disciplinary/JJ action/NN ./.
Very/NNP disappointed/VBD ,/, will/MD not/RB be/VB recommending/VBG this/DT place/NN to/TO anyone/NN ./.
We/PRP went/VBD there/RB for/IN late/JJ lunch/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP ./.
We/PRP biked/VBD there/RB and/CC with/IN a/DT 3/JJ year/NN old/JJ daughter/NN ./.
Felt/NNP a/DT little/JJ under/NN dressed/VBD for/IN the/DT place/NN ,/, but/CC everyone/NN there/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
Very/NNP happy/NN with/IN what/WP we/PRP ordered/VBP and/CC the/DT service/NN too/RB !/.
We/PRP want/VBP to/TO try/VB their/PRP$ dinner/NN and/CC I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ gon/NN na/NN be/VB a/DT great/JJ one/CD too/NN !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN twice/NN now/RB and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG both/DT times/NNS around/IN ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP went/VBD with/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN friends/NNS and/CC we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB out/RP a/DT bunch/NN of/IN dishes/NNS and/CC share/NN them/PRP between/IN all/DT of/IN us/PRP ./.
Even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ pricey/NN the/DT service/NN was/VBD amazing/VBG and/CC our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD very/RB knowledgeable/JJ and/CC stopped/RB by/IN many/JJ times/NNS to/TO see/VB how/WRB things/NNS were/VBD going/VBG ./.
I/PRP knew/VBD that/IN I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB come/VB back/RB again/RB ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN around/IN is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN why/WRB I/PRP knocked/VBD off/RP a/DT star/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN giving/VBG the/DT full/JJ 5/NN which/WDT I/PRP would/MD have/VB after/IN the/DT first/JJ visit/NN ./.
Just/NNP like/IN the/DT last/JJ time/NN the/DT food/NN was/VBD incredible/JJ ,/, I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT mushroom/NN risotto/NN which/WDT is/VBZ hands/VBG down/IN the/DT best/JJS risotto/NN I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN !/.
The/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN has/VBZ a/DT great/JJ vibe/NN and/CC looks/NNS very/RB up/RB to/TO date/NN ./.
My/NNP main/NNP complaint/NN has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT service/NN we/PRP received/VBD ./.
We/PRP started/VBD off/RP with/IN one/CD server/NN who/WP poured/VBN our/PRP$ drinks/NNS and/CC said/VBD he/PRP would/MD be/VB back/RB shortly/RB to/TO take/VB our/NN orders/NNS ./.
We/PRP both/VBP decided/VBN pretty/RB quickly/RB on/IN what/WP dish/JJ to/TO ordered/NN however/RB our/JJ server/NN had/VBD disappeared/VBN ./.
After/IN waiting/NN and/CC waiting/VBG we/PRP ended/VBD up/RP flagging/VBG down/IN a/DT different/JJ server/NN who/WP ended/VBD up/RP taking/NN over/IN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ guy/NN was/VBD a/DT lot/NN better/NN and/CC managed/NN to/TO turn/VB the/DT evening/NN around/IN completely/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB recommend/VB checking/VBG them/PRP out/RP for/IN their/PRP$ great/JJ food/NN ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT most/JJS delicious/JJ Italian/JJ food/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN by/IN how/WRB cool/JJ the/DT inside/NN of/IN this/DT restaurant/NN looked/VBD since/IN the/DT outside/NN is/VBZ just/RB black/JJ but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ awesome/JJ ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP an/DT app/NN and/CC two/CD pasta/NN dishes/NNS ./.
The/DT servers/NNS we/PRP had/VBD were/VBN very/RB nice/JJ ./.
They/PRP filled/VBD up/RP our/PRP$ water/NN ,/, cleared/VBD our/PRP$ plates/NNS in/IN a/DT timely/RB fashion/NN ./.
The/DT server/NN brought/VBD us/PRP bread/VBD while/IN we/PRP waited/VBD for/IN our/PRP$ app/NN and/CC the/DT butter/ginger/garlic/NN dressing/VBG that/IN came/JJ with/IN it/PRP was/VBD different/JJ and/CC yummy/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ appetizer/NN was/VBD so/RB fresh/JJ and/CC crispy/NN !/.
Our/NNP main/VBD pasta/NN dishes/NNS were/VBD just/RB as/IN fresh/JJ and/CC filling/JJ ./.
We/PRP even/RB forked/VBD out/IN some/DT room/NN for/IN tiramisu/NN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD not/RB even/RB explain/VB how/WRB creamy/JJ it/PRP was/VBD ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT beat/NNP tiramisu/NN 's/POS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN that/WDT was/VBD n't/RB that/IN great/NN was/VBD the/DT turnover/NN time/NN between/IN meals/NNS because/IN they/PRP make/VBP the/DT food/NN fresh/NN (/VBD i/NNP think/NNP )/NNP but/CC definitely/RB worth/VBD the/DT $/$ $/CD ./.
Two/CD thumbs/NNS up/IN !/CD

Lost/NNP one/CD star/NN because/IN I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT price/NN is/VBZ a/DT LITTLE/NNP high/JJ for/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP (/VBN compared/VBN with/IN marcellos/NNS )/NNS ,/, eg/VBP the/DT cheapest/NN glass/NN of/IN wine/NN is/VBZ $/$ 12.50/CD ,/, but/CC beer/NN is/VBZ normal/JJ ./.
Most/JJS expensive/JJ glass/NN of/IN wine/NN is/VBZ $/$ 58/glass/CD
Wonderful/NNP atmosphere/RB to/TO enjoy/JJ time/NN with/IN family/NN and/CC friends/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN never/RB disappoints/VBZ from/IN the/DT pizza/NN ,/, polenta/NN fries/NNS ,/, salad/RB ,/, pasta/NN ,/, risotto/NN ,/, lamb/NN and/CC veal/NN scallopini/NN !/VBD !/NNP !/.
Everyone/NNP 's/POS meal/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
You/PRP must/MD have/VB to/TO leave/VB room/NN for/IN dessert/NN ./.
Nutella/NNP and/CC Fruita/NNP de/NNP Bosca/NNP pizzas/NNS were/VBD delicious/JJ ./.

Looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO going/VB back/RB soon/RB ./.
Just/NNP a/DT fabulous/JJ Italian/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
Their/NNP pizza/NN is/VBZ among/IN the/DT best/JJS we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN and/CC their/PRP$ other/JJ dishes/NNS ,/, including/VBG pasta/NN ,/, are/VBP just/RB beautiful/JJ ./.
Make/NNP sure/VBD to/TO check/NN outthe/NN daily/JJ specials/NNS ,/, the/DT list/NN can/MD be/VB extensive/JJ ./.

A/DT must/MD visit/VB in/IN Woodbridge/NNP ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP afternoon/NN for/IN a/DT family/NN function/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD no/DT idea/NN there/EX was/VBD even/RB a/DT restaurant/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN being/VBG that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN a/DT small/JJ strip/NN mall/NN but/CC it/PRP takes/VBZ up/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT space/NN ,/, about/IN half/DT it/PRP seems/VBZ ./.
The/DT inside/NN of/IN this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ really/RB visually/RB striking/VBG ./.
The/DT red/VBN and/CC black/JJ theme/NN is/VBZ throughout/IN the/DT interior/NN from/IN the/DT signs/NNS ,/, walls/NNS ,/, and/CC tables/NNS ./.
The/DT menu/NN has/VBZ a/DT mixed/NN of/IN antipasto/NN ,/, salads/NNS ,/, pasta/NN ,/, meats/NNS ,/, fish/JJ ,/, risotto/NN and/CC pizzas/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ mix/NN of/IN dishes/NNS and/CC choices/NNS ./.
I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP getting/VBG the/DT quattro/NN stagione/NN and/CC my/PRP$ wife/NN had/VBD ordered/VBN the/DT white/JJ potato/NN pizza/NN ./.
The/DT quattro/NN stagione/NN literally/RB translated/VBD means/NNP four/CD seasons/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP used/JJ to/TO seeing/NN this/DT pizza/NN 's/POS ingredients/NNS on/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT 4/NN quarters/NNS pizzas/NNS like/IN quadrants/NNS ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB it/PRP that/IN way/NN for/IN some/DT reason/NN ./.
All/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS (/VBP mushrooms/NNS ,/, prosciutto/NN ,/, olives/NNS and/CC artichokes/NNS )/NNS were/VBD evenly/RB spread/JJ across/IN the/DT pizza/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD still/RB decent/JJ but/CC just/RB not/RB what/WP I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG to/TO see/VB ./.
My/NNP wife/NN ate/NN about/IN half/DT of/IN her/PRP potato/NN pizza/NN ./.
Typically/RB if/IN we/PRP go/VBP to/TO a/DT place/NN that/WDT serves/NNS pizza/VBP she/PRP 'll/MD always/RB go/VB with/IN a/DT white/JJ pizza/NN (/VBD no/DT red/VBN sauce/JJ )/NN if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT option/NN and/CC she/PRP likes/VBZ potato/NN pizza/NN in/IN general/JJ where/WRB ever/RB she/PRP can/MD find/VB it/PRP ./.
She/PRP only/RB ate/VBP half/DT of/IN it/PRP as/IN she/PRP usually/RB does/VBZ but/CC she/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD too/RB greasy/JJ ./.
I/PRP was/VBD too/RB full/JJ to/TO have/VB any/DT of/IN her/PRP pizza/NN since/IN I/PRP ate/VBP all/DT of/IN mine/NN at/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT potato/NN pizza/NN came/VBD with/IN onions/NNS and/CC pancetta/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP used/JJ to/TO pancetta/NN being/VBG thicker/NN and/CC more/JJR fatty/NN like/IN bacon/NN ./.
Honestly/RB this/DT pancetta/NN looked/VBD like/IN deli/NN sliced/VBD cooked/VBN ham/NN ./.
We/PRP took/VBD home/NN the/DT left/NN overs/NNS and/CC I/PRP ended/VBD up/RB eating/VBG them/PRP that/IN night/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB the/DT potato/NN pizza/NN was/VBD very/RB greasy/JJ I/PRP have/VBP to/TO agree/VB with/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN ./.
The/DT bottom/NN crust/NN was/VBD in/IN fact/NN saturated/VBD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB pretty/RB ./.
Overall/IN the/DT pizzas/NNS were/VBD n't/RB out/IN of/IN this/DT world/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD safely/RB say/VB that/IN in/IN the/DT GTA/NNP we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN much/RB better/JJR than/IN this/DT ./.
It/PRP seemed/VBD that/IN the/DT toppings/NNS were/VBD n't/RB very/RB generous/JJ or/CC distributed/JJ properly/RB ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT quattro/NN stagione/NN is/VBZ not/RB even/RB in/IN quarters/NNS ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/IN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN Neapolitan/JJ style/JJ pizza/NN before/IN so/RB I/PRP know/VBP what/WP to/TO sort/NN of/IN expect/NN and/CC mind/NN you/PRP this/DT place/NN although/IN not/RB VPN/NNP certified/VBD like/IN Libretto/NNP or/CC Pizza/NNP e/VBP Pazzi/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB to/TO be/VB like/IN many/JJ other/JJ places/NNS out/IN there/EX but/CC I/PRP simply/RB found/VBD this/DT pizza/NN to/TO be/VB not/RB as/RB good/JJ all/DT around/NN ./.
Whether/NNP it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT thickness/NN of/IN the/DT crust/NN or/CC the/DT ingredients/NNS simply/RB put/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ non-VPN/JJ Neapolitan/NNP type/NN style/NN pizza/NN out/IN there/RB in/IN the/DT GTA/NNP (/NNP 850/CD Degrees/NNS ,/, Napoli/NNP Centrale/NNP )/NNP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ IMO/NNP a/DT notch/NN lower/JJR than/IN Grazie/NNP ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB speak/VB to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN but/CC as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT pizza/NN for/IN me/PRP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT go/NN to/TO place/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD attentive/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
My/NNP second/VBD time/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
Decent/NNP food/NN ,/, causal/JJ atmosphere/RB ,/, good/JJ portions/NNS ,/, and/CC reasonable/JJ prices/NNS ./.
Dined/NNP here/RB on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP night/NN ./.
Walked/NNP in/IN without/IN a/DT reservation/NN at/IN quarter/NN to/TO 7/CD and/CC was/VBD seated/VBN without/IN issue/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD pretty/RB busy/JJ though/IN so/IN we/PRP may/MD have/VB lucked/VBN out/RP getting/VBG a/DT table/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP my/VBN favourite/JJ wine/NN by/IN the/DT glass/NN (/VBD caymus/NNS cab/NN sauv/NN )/NN so/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ an/DT automatic/JJ winner/NN in/IN my/PRP$ books/NN !/.
They/PRP have/VBP tons/VBN of/IN specials/NNS so/IN no/DT worries/NNS if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB anything/NN on/IN their/PRP$ menu/NN !/.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT salumiere/JJ plate/NN to/TO start/VB ./.
You/PRP really/RB ca/VBP n't/RB go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN cured/JJ meats/NNS ,/, and/CC you/PRP get/VB tons/NNS of/IN it/PRP for/IN $/$ 18/CD !/CD
My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT caprese/JJ Di/NNP bufala/NN which/WDT was/VBD kinda/NN disappointing/NN ./.
The/DT tomatoes/NNS were/VBD n't/RB quite/JJ ripe/NN enough/RB and/CC the/DT bufala/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/RB creamy/JJ or/CC flavourful/JJ as/IN one/CD would/NN like/IN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT meat/NN specials/NNS (/VBP Tagliata/NNP di/NNP manzo/NN with/IN truffled/VBN salad/NN for/IN $/$ 32/CD )/CD -/JJ which/WDT was/VBD essentially/RB a/DT carved/VBN steak/NN with/IN an/DT arugula/NN salad/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP arugula/JJ salad/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP must/MD admit/VB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ disappointed/JJ that/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB come/VB as/IN a/DT fancy/NN schmancy/NN salad/JJ as/IN the/DT name/NN suggested/NN ./.
The/DT steak/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN veiny/NN but/CC probably/RB my/JJ fault/NN for/IN ordering/VBG a/DT not/RB so/RB great/JJ cut/NN of/IN meat/NN rare/NN ./.
My/NNP friend/NN ordered/VBD the/DT salmon/NN special/JJ which/WDT looked/VBN fantastic/JJ ./.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB try/VB the/DT fish/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD steal/JJ a/DT brussel/NN sprout/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ (/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT fan/JJ of/IN brussel/NN sprouts/NNS at/IN all/DT !/NNP )/NNP ./.
Ended/VBD the/DT meal/NN with/IN a/DT latte/JJ (/NN very/RB unremarkable/JJ )/NN and/CC the/DT tiramisu/NN ./.
The/DT tiramisu/NN was/VBD a/DT lot/NN more/RBR cream/NN than/IN I/PRP had/VBD expected/VBN ,/, but/CC I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBD it/PRP ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD good/JJ albeit/NN unmemorable/JJ ./.
A/DT decent/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT laid/JJ back/NN casual/JJ dinner/NN !/.
Had/NNP to/TO chime/NN in/IN since/IN the/DT scores/NNS were/VBD so/RB low/JJ ./.
Have/NNP eaten/VBD here/RB approx/RB 6/CD times/NNS and/CC loved/VBN it/PRP every/DT time/NN ./.
Have/NNP tried/VBD most/JJS of/IN the/DT appetizers/NNS and/CC the/DT Marguerita/NNP ,/, Margherita/NNP DOP/NNP ,/, and/CC Sophia/NNP pizzas/NNS ./.
Their/NNP pizza/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN and/CC yes/VBZ I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO Pizza/NNP Libretto/NNP and/CC AutoStrata/NNP ./.
I/PRP also/RB think/VBP the/DT Tiramisu/NNP is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ./.
So/IN light/JJ ,/, almost/RB frothy/JJ ./.
You/PRP are/VBP better/VBG off/RP with/IN a/DT reservation/NN but/CC for/IN a/DT party/NN of/IN 2/CD you/PRP can/MD sit/VB at/IN the/DT bar/NN until/IN a/DT table/JJ becomes/NN available/NN ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB enough/RB good/JJ things/NNS about/IN this/DT restaurant/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP already/RB repeat/JJ customers/NNS and/CC ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO go/VB back/RB again/RB ./.

The/DT food/NN was/VBD okay/NN ./.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO highlight/VB the/DT octopus/NN dishes/VBZ and/CC the/DT charcoal/NN veggie/NN pizza/NN ./.
The/DT octopus/NN was/VBD soooo/JJ fishy/JJ and/CC chewy/NN ,/, way/RB more/JJR than/IN expected/CD ./.

The/DT main/JJ reason/NN to/TO come/VB here/RB to/TO try/VB the/DT pizza/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB as/IN I/PRP expected/VBP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/NN and/CC the/DT black/NN olives/NNS were/VBD extremely/RB salty/JJ ./.

This/DT used/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT go/NN to/TO restaurant/VB for/IN dinners/NNS after/IN work/NN or/CC on/IN the/DT weekends/NNS with/IN both/DT family/NN and/CC friends/NNS ./.
Everything/NN in/IN the/DT menu/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, especially/RB the/DT Specials/NNS and/CC the/DT Pizza/NNP ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD great/JJ too/RB although/IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD always/RB very/RB busy/JJ ./.
For/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN months/NNS this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ starting/VBG to/TO lose/VB its/PRP$ vibe/NN -/JJ all/PDT the/DT previous/JJ staff/NN are/VBP not/RB there/RB anymore/RB and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ not/RB great/JJ although/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ half/VBN empty/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ also/RB not/RB consistent/JJ and/CC it/PRP often/RB looks/VBZ messy/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN ./.
The/DT Specials/NNS '/POS board/NN only/RB has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ specials../NN
Drove/NN by/IN to/TO have/VB dinner/NN last/JJ night/NN around/IN 8:00PM/CD and/CC there/EX was/VBD only/RB 1/CD table/JJ in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN -/JJ I/PRP have/VBP never/RB seen/VBN Motorino/NNP empty/NN like/IN that/DT before/NN ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP there/RB are/VBP new/JJ owners/NNS -/JJ if/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB maintain/VB the/DT restaurant/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VBD before/RB ,/, including/VBG the/DT food/NN and/CC service/NN ,/, they/PRP will/MD lose/VB all/PDT the/DT clientele/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT shame/NN because/IN Motorino/NNP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB try/VBD to/TO change/VB the/DT restaurant/NN ;/: it/PRP was/VBD successful/JJ before/NN for/IN a/DT reason/NN !/.
!/NN
Motorino/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT restaurants/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ neighbourhood/NN ,/, so/RB expectations/RB at/IN finding/VBG another/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO dine/VB at/IN were/VBD high/JJ ./.
Needless/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, since/IN my/PRP$ initial/NN visit/NN I/PRP have/VBP yet/VBN to/TO go/VB back/RB ./.
The/DT place/NN has/VBZ a/DT youthful/JJ ,/, high/JJ energy/NN vibe/NN about/IN .../CD .../: ..one/NN would/MD hope/VB the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN would/MD live/VB up/RP to/TO the/DT hype/NN ./.
We/PRP arrived/VBD without/IN a/DT reservation/NN so/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ to/TO become/VB available/JJ ./.
Certainly/RB not/RB the/DT restaurants/NNS fault/NN ./.
We/PRP perused/VBD the/DT menu/NN while/IN waiting/NN and/CC the/DT wait/NN was/VBD only/RB approx/RB ./.
10/CD minutes/NNS ./.
The/DT smells/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN were/VBD intoxicating/VBG .../VBN ..so/NN by/IN the/DT time/NN our/VBD waiter/NN came/VBD by/IN for/IN a/DT drink/NN order/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD ready/NN to/TO order/NN our/NN food/NN ./.
Waiters/NNP attitude/NN was/VBD off-putting/JJ ,/, as/RB though/IN he/PRP was/VBD doing/VBG us/PRP the/DT favour/JJ by/IN allowing/VBG himself/PRP to/TO be/VB our/VBN server/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP and/CC off/IN he/PRP went/VBD .../: .../: .never/NN came/VBD back/RB to/TO check/NN on/IN us/PRP ./.
He/PRP did/VBD stop/VB by/IN a/DT table/JJ near/NN to/TO us/PRP as/IN he/PRP had/VBD friends/NNS in/IN dining/NN that/IN night/NN and/CC actually/RB sat/JJ with/IN them/PRP for/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS chatting/VBG .../: ..all/JJ while/IN we/PRP had/VBD empty/JJ drink/NN glasses/NNS in/IN front/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO flag/NN him/PRP down/RB on/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ many/JJ trips/NNS past/JJ us/NN for/IN a/DT drink/NN refill/NN order/NN ./.
Food/NNP arrived/VBD after/IN a/DT substantial/JJ wait/NN (/IN it/PRP was/VBD very/RB busy/JJ so/IN one/CD must/NN expect/VBP the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO be/VB overwhelmed/VBN )/-NONE- but/CC it/PRP was/VBD unmemorable/JJ ./.
Two/NN of/IN us/PRP had/VBD ordered/VBN pizza/NN .../: and/CC both/DT agreed/NNS we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN much/JJ better/NN elsewhere/RB ./.
The/DT other/JJ members/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ party/NN were/VBD equally/RB unimpressed/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
Obviously/RB this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ going/VBG for/IN a/DT younger/JJR crowd/NN than/IN us/PRP (/VBD lol/NN )/NNS but/CC the/DT noise/NN ,/, combined/VBN with/IN average/JJ food/NN flavour/NN ,/, warrants/RB this/DT rating/NN ./.
We/PRP have/VBP not/RB gone/VB back/RB
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT pity/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
Right/NNP now/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP having/VBG lunch/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ empty/NN ./.
Including/NNP us/VBD 4/JJ people/NNS ./.
Before/NNP it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN ./.
employees/NNS look/VBP unhappy/JJ ./.
I/PRP went/VBD to/TO washroom/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD dirty/JJ ./.
No/DT soap/NN no/DT paper/NN ./.
How/NNP did/VBD they/PRP turn/VB in/IN too/RB bad/JJ from/IN an/DT outstanding/JJ restaurant/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ unbelievable/JJ ./.
./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB my/VBN last/JJ visit/NN ./.
We/PRP really/VBP wanted/VBN to/TO like/IN this/DT place/NN as/IN its/PRP$ close/JJ to/TO home/NN but/CC unfortunately/RB will/MD not/RB return/VB ./.
The/DT first/JJ part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ night/NN went/VBD well/RB .../IN the/DT place/NN was/VBD not/RB busy/JJ at/IN all/DT so/IN we/PRP were/VBD quickly/RB seated/VBN ,/, good/JJ vibe/NN ,/, trendy/NN decor/NN ,/, youthful/JJ and/CC family-friendly/JJ ./.
Our/NNP waiter/NN started/VBD out/RP great/JJ -/NN very/RB personable/JJ tho/IN the/DT poor/JJ guy/NN had/VBD to/TO spend/VB almost/RB 5/VBN minutes/NNS on/IN his/PRP$ spiel/NN about/IN the/DT 12+/CD items/NNS on/IN Special/JJ ./.
He/PRP provided/VBD some/DT good/JJ recommendations/NNS on/IN apps/NNS and/CC mains/NNS ./.
The/DT octopus/NN salad/NN was/VBD a/DT great/JJ kick-start/NN to/TO the/DT night/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD followed/VBN by/IN an/DT avocado/NN and/CC burrato/NN stromboli/NN which/WDT was/VBD over/IN a/DT foot-long/JJ and/CC very/RB filling/JJ (/IN they/PRP messed/VBD up/RB this/DT order/NN by/IN putting/VBG ham/NN in/IN it/PRP but/CC we/PRP took/VBD it/PRP because/IN it/PRP looked/VBD yummy/JJ )/NN ./.
We/PRP only/RB had/VBD a/DT small/JJ piece/NN each/DT in/IN order/NN to/TO save/VB room/NN for/IN the/DT mains/NNS ./.
Well/NNP that/IN wasnt/JJ necessary/JJ since/IN we/PRP hardly/RB touched/VBD the/DT mains/NNS -/VBP the/DT papardelle/NN was/VBD over-cooked/JJ and/CC sticking/JJ together/NNS and/CC the/DT fennel/NN salad/NN was/VBD very/RB over-dressed/JJ ./.
The/DT biggest/JJS dissapointment/NN were/VBD the/DT fridge-temperature/JJ meatballs/NNS -/JJ not/RB room/NN temperature/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD actually/RB cold/JJ inside/NN ./.
We/PRP couldnt/VBP find/VBG out/RP waiter/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC twice/NN had/VBD to/TO ask/VB different/JJ staff/NN to/TO retrieve/VB him/PRP ./.
The/DT hostess/manager/NN was/VBD good/JJ about/IN taking/CD care/NNS of/IN these/DT items/NNS on/IN the/DT bill/NN and/CC providing/VBG complementary/NN dessert/NN ./.
Based/NNP on/IN the/DT other/JJ positive/JJ reviews/NNS ,/, this/DT place/NN could/MD be/VB a/DT hit/NN or/CC miss/NN but/CC I/PRP definitely/RB would/MD n't/RB chance/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
Had/NNP dinner/NN tonight/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN with/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB impressed/VBN ./.
Pizza/NNP was/VBD very/RB flimsy/JJ and/CC soggy/JJ ./.
Cesar/NNP salad/VBD had/VBD little/JJ flavour/NN ./.
Penne/NNP a/DT la/NN vodka/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./.
Service/NNP was/VBD awful/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ waiter/NN was/VBD too/RB busy/JJ so/IN she/PRP had/VBD another/DT server/NN take/VB our/PRP$ order/NN ./.
She/PRP then/RB proceeded/VBD to/TO not/RB ever/VB come/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ and/CC we/PRP had/VBD no/DT waiter/NN the/DT whole/JJ evening/NN ./.
we/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB for/IN everything/NN -/JJ drinks/NNS ,/, water/NN refills/NNS and/CC hot/NN oil/NN multiple/JJ times/NNS ./.
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO ask/VB to/TO pay/VB our/PRP$ bill/NN multiple/NN times/NNS ./.
Asked/NNP for/IN the/DT manager/NN to/TO come/VB over/RB and/CC he/PRP never/RB showed/VBD ./.
After/IN waiting/NN about/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS we/PRP just/RB left/VBP ./.
Do/NNP not/RB recommend/VB and/CC will/MD never/RB return/VB ./.
I/PRP went/VBD in/IN January/NNP for/IN dinner/NN and/CC enjoyed/VBD the/DT menu/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
Went/NNP back/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT menu/NN had/VBD been/VBN changed/VBN and/CC I/PRP found/VBD the/DT wine/NN very/RB over/IN priced/NNS ./.
Disappointing/VBG ./.
Not/RB worth/IN the/DT money/NN
I/PRP hosted/VBD my/PRP$ birthday/NN party/NN on/IN Sept.3/2016/CD at/IN Motorino/NNP and/CC they/PRP did/VBD a/DT fantastic/JJ job/NN !/.
We/PRP were/VBD a/DT party/NN of/IN 14/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD phenomenal/JJ ./.
The/DT waiter/NN let/VBD us/PRP split/VB bills/NNS ,/, was/VBD so/RB knowledgable/JJ about/IN the/DT menu/NN and/CC was/VBD very/RB attentive/JJ ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ and/CC all/DT my/NNS guests/NNS were/VBD happy/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP so/RB glad/JJ we/PRP booked/VBD our/PRP$ party/NN here/RB and/CC would/MD definitely/RB do/VB it/PRP again/RB ./.
Motorino/NNP Enoteca/NNP does/VBZ have/VB a/DT modern/JJ and/CC youth/JJ decoration/NN ./.
Loud/NNP ,/, high/JJ energy/NN and/CC quite/JJ chic/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB wish/VBP the/DT food/NN and/CC the/DT services/NNS can/MD be/VB as/RB high/JJ energy/NN as/IN the/DT vibe/NN !/.
Dropping/VBG by/IN for/IN a/DT late/JJ lunch/NN and/CC the/DT services/NNS was/VBD just/RB indifferent/JJ and/CC slow/JJ ./.
My/NNP Rigatoni/NNP alla/NNP Norma/NNP (/NNP Fried/NNP eggplant/NN ,/, light/JJ tomato/NN sauce/NN and/CC Imported/VBD riotta/NN salata/NN )/NN for/IN $/$ 16/CD is/VBZ not/RB bad/JJ in/IN taste/JJ but/CC definitely/RB overpriced/VBN ./.
No/DT bread/NN was/VBD ever/RB offered/VBN .../: wish/JJ I/PRP have/VBP that/IN to/TO dip/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT tomato/NN sauce/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP just/RB me/PRP ,/, if/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP rounds/NNS and/CC rounds/NNS of/IN drinks/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ services/NNS maybe/VBP a/DT lot/NN better/RBR ?/.
There/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ options/NNS of/IN good/JJ Italian/JJ food/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO skip/VB Motorino/NNP !/.
Was/NNP recommended/VBD to/TO eat/NN at/IN this/DT unfriendly/JJ place/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN made/VBD us/PRP feel/VBP that/IN they/PRP were/VBD doing/VBG us/PRP a/DT favour/JJ for/IN eating/VBG at/IN their/PRP$ restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT wait/NN staff/NN was/VBD a/DT joke/NN ./.
We/PRP started/VBD out/RP with/IN an/DT Italian/JJ waiter/NN that/WDT could/MD not/RB be/VB understood/JJ since/IN his/PRP$ English/NN was/VBD terrible/JJ ,/, he/PRP mumbled/VBD and/CC treated/VBD us/PRP as/IN we/PRP never/RB have/VBP been/VBN to/TO an/DT Italian/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB looked/VBD dirty/NN with/IN a/DT pencil/NN mustache/NN ./.
He/PRP kept/VBD coming/VBG back/RB to/TO our/PRP$ table/JJ even/RB though/IN we/PRP told/VBD him/PRP that/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB ready/JJ to/TO order/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB got/VBD a/DT replacement/NN of/IN another/DT useless/NN waiter/NN ./.
This/DT guy/NN was/VBD spraying/VBG tables/NNS like/IN a/DT lunatic/JJ with/IN sterilizer/NN that/IN could/MD be/VB smelled/VBN from/IN across/IN the/DT room/NN ./.
When/WRB will/MD they/VB learn/NN to/TO spray/VB the/DT liquid/NN on/IN the/DT rag/NN ?/.
So/RB if/IN anyone/NN is/VBZ looking/VBG for/IN over/IN dressed/VBN salads/NNS ,/, oily/RB pastas/RB ,/, heartburn/JJ pizza/NN and/CC bad/JJ espresso/NN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN ./.
Downtown/NNP prices/NNS poorly/RB executed/VBN dishes/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN ingredients/NNS were/VBD fresh/JJ ./.
Only/RB positive/JJ ./.
Italian/JJ mall/JJ food/NN would/MD be/VB better/RBR ./.
