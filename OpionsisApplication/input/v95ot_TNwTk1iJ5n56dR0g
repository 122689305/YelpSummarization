Well/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ my/VBG first/JJ time/NN writing/NN for/IN a/DT food/NN court/NN vendor/NN but/CC honestly/RB once/RB I/PRP tasted/VBD their/PRP$ food/NN ,/, I/PRP felt/VBD like/IN I/PRP was/VBD in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN but/CC this/DT kind/NN of/IN food/NN comes/NN from/IN a/DT food/NN court/NN vendor/NN ./.
Vince/NNP BBQ/NNP &/CC Chinese/NNP Food/NNP is/VBZ a/DT food/NN court/NN vendor/NN that/WDT is/VBZ operating/VBG in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN their/PRP$ main/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, Vince/NNP Seafood/NNP and/CC BBQ/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ located/VBN just/RB steps/JJ away/NN from/IN the/DT food/NN court/NN ./.
Vince/NNP BBQ/NNP &/CC Chinese/NNP Food/NNP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN for/IN customers/NNS to/TO have/VB a/DT quick/JJ ,/, hot/NN ,/, fresh/JJ ,/, and/CC tasty/NN meal/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB eaten/VBN at/IN the/DT food/NN court/NN or/CC be/VB available/JJ for/IN take-out/NN ./.
Rather/RB than/IN having/VBG a/DT sit/NN down/IN meal/NN at/IN the/DT nearby/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, customers/NNS can/MD expect/VB to/TO have/VB quick/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ meals/NNS in/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN minutes/NNS ./.
Vince/NN does/VBZ the/DT classic/JJ stir/NN fry/NN dishes/VBZ to/TO perfection/NN ./.
They/PRP stick/VBP to/TO the/DT classics/NNS and/CC customers/NNS will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB these/DT dishes/NNS for/IN a/DT good/JJ price/NN ./.
They/PRP have/VBP great/VBN combinations/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN dinner/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD make/VB a/DT selection/NN of/IN how/WRB many/JJ dishes/NNS you/PRP would/MD want/VB ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD select/VB 3/JJ items/NNS ,/, which/WDT includes/-NONE- rice/VBP and/CC soup/VB ,/, from/IN their/PRP$ special/JJ combo/NN menu/NN for/IN $/$ 19.50/CD plus/NNS taxes/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ deal/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP feeling/VBG a/DT bit/NN off/IN take/JJ out/NN for/IN an/DT evening/NN dinner/NN ./.
In/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT fried/JJ noodles/NNS and/CC rice/NN ,/, the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ ,/, ranging/VBG from/IN $/$ 5-/CD $/$ 7/CD ,/, and/CC you/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB disappointed/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP absolutely/RB amazing/VBG ./.
The/DT BBQ/NNP selection/NN is/VBZ astonishing/VBG ,/, I/PRP have/VBP not/RB had/VBN good/JJ Chinese/JJ BBQ/NN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ,/, and/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VBP a/DT taste/NN of/IN authentic/JJ Chinese/JJ BBQ/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
If/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB decide/VB what/WP to/TO order/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB trying/VBG the/DT Cantonese/NNP Chow/NNP Mein/NNP ,/, Yeung/NNP Chow/NNP Fried/NNP Rice/NNP ,/, Stir/NNP Fired/NNP Beef/NNP with/IN Seasonal/NNP Vegetables/NNP ,/, Salt/NNP and/CC Pepper/NNP Pork/NNP Chop/NNP ,/, or/CC their/PRP$ BBQ/NN items/NNS with/IN Noodles/NNS in/IN Soup/NNP ./.
I/PRP will/MD defintely/RB be/VB coming/VBG to/TO this/DT food/NN court/NN vendor/NN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.
Before/NNP I/PRP forget/RB ,/, try/IN their/PRP$ Soya/NNP Sauce/NNP Chicken/NNP Leg/NNP Special/NNP !/.
$/$ 0.99/CD for/IN a/DT chicken/NN leg/NN ,/, what/WP a/DT deal/NN !/.
Good/NNP dim/NNP sum/NN and/CC reasonable/NN prices/NNS ./.
The/DT food/NN came/VBD very/RB quickly/RB and/CC tasted/VBN good/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ./.
The/DT specials/NNS are/VBP cheap/NN and/CC the/DT staff/NN are/VBP quite/JJ friendly/RB ./.
The/DT washrooms/NNS are/VBP really/RB gross/JJ .../: ..i/NNP would/MD n't/RB recommend/VB going/VBG before/RB eating/VBG as/IN you/PRP 'd/MD probably/RB loose/VB your/PRP$ appetite/NN ./.
This/DT will/MD probably/RB be/VB my/VBN last/JJ time/NN visiting/VBG this/DT place/NN ./.
My/NNP family/NN and/CC I/PRP came/VBD here/RB earlier/JJR tonight/NN for/IN a/DT Mother/NNP Day/NNP 's/POS dinner/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT set/NN meal/NN and/CC the/DT dishes/NNS came/VBD out/RP at/IN a/DT decent/JJ time/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB until/IN near/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN dinner/NN when/WRB we/PRP called/VBP for/IN the/DT bill/NN my/VBD mom/NN noticed/VBD on/IN the/DT slip/NN of/IN paper/NN with/IN our/PRP$ order/NN written/NN that/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS did/VBD n't/RB come/VB ./.
So/IN we/PRP asked/VBD the/DT waitress/NN about/IN it/PRP and/CC she/PRP apologized/VBD and/CC that/IN she/PRP 'll/VBD check/NN ./.
My/NNP mom/NN told/VBD her/PRP no/DT need/NN since/IN we/PRP 're/VBP finished/VBN with/IN dinner/NN and/CC would/MD like/VB to/TO cancel/NN that/IN dish/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT waitress/NN told/VBD her/PRP if/IN the/DT kitchen/NN is/VBZ making/VBG the/DT dish/JJ then/RB we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB cancel/VB ./.
Anyway/NNP ,/, by/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT dish/JJ arrived/VBN our/PRP$ table/JJ was/VBD already/RB cleared/VBN ./.
The/DT waitress/NN sets/VBZ our/PRP$ table/JJ again/RB -/JJ yes/NNS I/PRP know/VBP ,/, just/RB to/TO eat/VB one/CD dish/JJ ?/.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB even/RB want/VB it/PRP anymore/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN did/VBD not/RB taste/VB good/JJ bc/NN it/PRP came/VBD out/RP cold/NN !/.
After/RB ,/, the/DT waitress/NN came/VBD and/CC said/VBD she/PRP 'll/MD bring/VB us/PRP the/DT desserts/NNS .../: well/RB that/IN took/NNP around/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS !/.
At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, everyone/NN was/VBD pretty/RB much/JJ pissed/VBN out/RP ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, service/NN was/VBD average..several/JJ times/NNS the/DT servers/NNS either/VBP forgot/NN to/TO bring/VB us/PRP refill/NN of/IN teas/NNS or/CC brought/VB us/PRP the/DT wrong/JJ order/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN they/PRP forgot/VBD one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ orders/NNS ./.
This/DT was/VBD actually/RB our/JJ second/JJ time/NN that/IN this/DT had/NN happened/VBD ,/, the/DT first/JJ time/NN was/VBD on/IN Chinese/JJ New/NNP Years/NNP -/NN but/CC we/PRP understood/VBD bc/JJ it/PRP was/VBD extremely/RB busy/JJ and/CC everyone/NN 's/POS running/NN around/IN ./.
But/CC tonight/NN was/VBD n't/RB too/RB busy/JJ I/PRP thought../VBP
My/NNP dad/VBD and/CC I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN dim/JJ sum/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ $/$ 1.98/CD before/CD 11:30/CD am/NN and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ no/DT tea/NN charge/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT tablecloth/NN fee/NN and/CC the/DT price/NN varies/VBZ depending/VBG on/IN the/DT table/JJ size/NN ./.
Since/IN there/EX was/VBD only/RB the/DT two/CD of/IN us/PRP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD $/$ 1/CD for/IN the/DT small/JJ table/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP 5/RB dishes/VBZ -/JJ sweet/JJ corn/NN and/CC pumpkin/NN congee/NN ,/, chicken/VBN feet/NN in/IN soy/JJ sauce/NN ,/, egg/NN with/IN ginger/JJR sauce/NN ,/, Shanghai/NNP style/NN bun/NN and/CC sweet/JJ egg/NN yolk/NN cake/NN ./.
What/WP I/PRP like/VBP about/IN this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ the/DT selection/NN of/IN food/NN they/PRP offer/VBP ./.
Also/RB ,/, everything/NN came/VBD really/RB quick/JJ and/CC tasted/VBN awesome/NN ./.
The/DT sweet/JJ corn/NN and/CC pumpkin/NN congee/NN was/VBD n't/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD but/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB decent/JJ ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN sweet/JJ egg/NN yolk/NN cake/NN before/IN at/IN another/DT restaurant/NN and/CC hated/VBD it/PRP but/CC I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP tasted/VBD really/RB good/JJ here/NN ./.
Lastly/RB ,/, the/DT service/NN here/RB was/VBD great/JJ ./.
We/PRP were/VBD n't/RB regular/JJ customers/NNS here/RB and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN the/DT waitresses/NNS treated/VBD us/PRP very/RB well/RB ./.
They/PRP were/VBD considerate/JJ enough/JJ to/TO keep/VB our/PRP$ dessert/NN warm/NN by/IN keeping/VBG the/DT cover/NN on/IN the/DT bamboo/NN container/NN ./.
After/IN a/DT quick/JJ trip/NN around/IN the/DT Pacific/NNP Mall/NNP ,/, my/NNP family/NN decided/VBD to/TO get/VB a/DT quick/JJ Chinese/JJ dinner/NN meal/NN at/IN Vince/NNP 's/POS BBQ/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT Wednesday/NNP evening/NN and/CC the/DT place/NN was/VBD pretty/RB packed/VBN with/IN local/JJ Cantonese/NNP speaking/NN people/NNS ./.
It/PRP looks/VBZ like/IN your/PRP$ typical/JJ Chinese/JJ seafood/NN place/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB used/VBN as/IN a/DT wedding/JJ banquet/NN reception/NN hall/NN during/IN the/DT weekends/NNS ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD the/DT $/$ 48/CD family/NN meal/NN which/WDT included/-NONE- chicken/VBP soup/RB ,/, bean/JJ curd/NN and/CC bok/NN choy/NN ,/, red/VBD snapper/NN fish/JJ ,/, pan/JJ fried/JJ beef/NN and/CC mushrooms/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT plate/NN of/IN BBQ/NNP duck/NN and/CC pork/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP decent/JJ portions/NNS and/CC we/PRP were/VBD pretty/VBN full/JJ by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./.
My/NNP favorite/JJ dish/JJ had/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT beef/NN and/CC mushrooms/NNS and/CC the/DT bean/JJ curd/NN with/IN bok/NN choy/NN ./.
The/DT red/VBD snapper/NN fish/NN was/VBD flavorless/JJ and/CC there/RB was/VBD n't/RB much/JJ BBQ/NNP meat/NN to/TO go/VB around/IN for/IN four/CD people/NNS ./.
As/IN far/RB as/IN the/DT food/NN goes/VBZ ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN this/DT place/NN four/CD stars/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO take/VB away/RP one/CD star/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT service/NN ./.
The/DT hostess/NN was/VBD nice/JJ but/CC the/DT food/NN came/VBD out/RP really/RB slow/JJ ./.
There/EX was/VBD seriously/RB 15/JJ minutes/NNS between/IN each/DT plate/NN ./.
Other/JJ tables/NNS were/VBD also/RB complaining/VBG that/IN the/DT service/NN was/VBD too/RB slow/JJ and/CC that/IN they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB receiving/VBG their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD because/IN there/NNS were/VBD n't/RB enough/JJ people/NNS working/VBG in/IN the/DT back/NN kitchen/NN or/CC if/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB enough/JJ food/NN to/TO feed/JJ everyone/NN ./.
In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, we/PRP could/MD have/VB saved/VBN quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN time/NN if/IN the/DT service/NN had/VBD been/VBN quicker/RB ./.
FYI/NNP :/: The/DT waiters/NNS speak/VBP English/JJ but/CC the/DT waitresses/NNS do/VBP n't/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD dinner/NN combo/NN the/DT first/JJ time/NN been/VBN there/RB ./.
Roasted/NNP Duck/NNP was/VBD amazing/VBG ./.
Duck/NNP skin/NN was/VBD really/RB crispy/JJ ./.
Lobster/NNP with/IN Noddles/NNP was/VBD quite/JJ tasty/NN too/RB ./.
The/DT second/JJ time/NN we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT dim/JJ sum/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT lowest/JJS price/NN I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN ./.
But/CC the/DT quality/NN really/RB let/VB me/PRP down/IN ./.
The/DT shanghai/NN bun/NN was/VBD cold/NN ./.
Veggie/NNP tofu/NNP roll/NN tasted/VBD awful/JJ ,/, the/DT mushroom/NN filling/VBG had/VBD gone/NN bad/JJ I/PRP think/VBP ./.
I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB dinner/NN for/IN sure/JJ ,/, but/CC certainly/RB not/RB a/DT good/JJ dim/NN sum/NN place/NN ./.
Located/NNP just/RB 15/CD minutes/NNS from/IN home/NN ./.
Went/NNP here/RB often/RB before/IN it/PRP was/VBD Vince/NNP 's/POS ./.
The/DT food/NN has/VBZ definitely/RB gone/NN downhill/NN since/IN the/DT old/JJ restaurant/NN closed/VBD (/RB name/VBN escapes/NNS me/PRP )/RB ./.
Portions/NNS i/VBP find/NNS are/VBP a/DT bit/JJ small/JJ and/CC dim/JJ sum/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ expensive/JJ due/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ ``/`` special/JJ ''/'' selections/NNS which/WDT cost/-NONE- a/DT lot/NN more/RBR ./.
Dim/NNP sum/NN quality/NN lacks/NNS in/IN taste/NN and/CC i/NN guess/NN the/DT only/RB positive/JJ thing/NN i/NN can/MD recall/VB is/VBZ the/DT service/NN ./.
Head/NNP somewhere/RB else/JJ people/NNS .../: better/JJ options/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP really/VBP want/JJ to/TO give/VB Vince/NNP more/JJR stars/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB per/VB the/DT dinner/NN last/JJ evening/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ reason/NN for/IN the/DT low/JJ rating/NN was/VBD the/DT inefficiency/NN of/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./.
We/PRP placed/VBP our/VBN orders/NNS at/IN 6:38pm/CD (/IN the/DT ticket/NN was/VBD time/NN stamped/VBD )/NN ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT seafood/NN tofu/NN hot/NN pot/NN and/CC a/DT honey/NN and/CC pepper/NN eel/NN dish/JJ ./.
The/DT hot/NN pot/NN arrived/VBD in/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS ./.
The/DT eel/NN arrived/VBD at/IN around/IN 7:30pm/CD ./.
Yap/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT whole/JJ 35/NN minutes/VBZ wait/NN for/IN the/DT second/JJ dish/NN ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD the/DT waitress/NN to/TO follow/VB up/RP on/IN the/DT eel/NN dish/JJ twice/NN ./.
A/DT manager/NN finally/RB lost/VBD it/PRP and/CC took/VBD our/NN ticket/NN to/TO the/DT kitchen/NN to/TO follow/VB up/RP the/DT third/JJ time/NN ./.
(/IN At/IN least/JJS the/DT service/NN on/IN the/DT restaurant/NN front/NN was/VBD good/JJ )/NN ./.
I/PRP noticed/VBD that/IN 2/CD other/JJ tables/NNS around/IN us/PRP also/RB asked/VBD to/TO follow/VB up/RP on/IN their/PRP$ orders/NNS ./.
To/TO be/VB fair/NN ,/, both/DT the/DT hot/NN pot/NN and/CC the/DT eel/NN dish/VB were/VBD delicious/JJ without/IN being/VBG oily/RB at/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT hot/NN pot/NN was/VBD of/IN reasonable/JJ portion/NN size/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT eel/NN dish/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN smaller/JJR than/IN average/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT was/VBD well/RB compensated/VBN by/IN the/DT deliciousness/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP always/RB enjoyed/VBN the/DT overall/JJ dining/NN experience/NN at/IN Vince/NNP since/IN it/PRP has/VBZ opened/VBN ./.
I/PRP enjoy/VBP its/PRP$ dinner/NN more/RBR than/IN its/PRP$ dim/JJ sum/NN ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT kitchen/NN has/VBZ had/VBN an/DT off/JJ night/NN yesterday/NN only/RB ./.
I/PRP will/MD surely/RB return/VB to/TO dine/VB again/RB and/CC update/VB the/DT rating/NN ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT experience/NN will/MD be/VB better/RBR ./.
We/PRP normally/RB head/VBP here/RB for/IN dim/JJ sum/NN early/RB in/IN the/DT morning/NN and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ less/JJR crowd/NN ./.
Dim/NNP sum/NN is/VBZ $/$ 2.28/CD for/IN all/DT sizes/NNS before/IN 11am/CD ./.
Pretty/NNP much/RB everything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ tasty/NN ./.
My/NNP only/RB complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT seating/NN is/VBZ very/RB tight/JJ ./.
You/PRP can/MD barely/RB walk/VB between/IN tables/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ my/NNP family/NN 's/POS to-go/NN place/NN for/IN dim/JJ sum/NN (/NN generally/RB on/IN weekends/NNS )/NNS ./.
Their/NNP food/NN quality/NN is/VBZ quite/RB good/JJ especially/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN being/VBG paid/NN ,/, so/IN the/DT overall/JJ customer/NN value/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
The/DT main/JJ dim/NN sums/NNS are/VBP cheaper/VBG before/IN 11AM/CD on/IN weekends/NNS ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ only/RB $/$ 0.20/CD more/RBR expensive/JJ after/IN 11AM/CD anyway/NN ./.
Even/RB if/IN you/PRP go/VBP on/IN weekends/NNS ,/, the/DT line/NN up/RB is/VBZ quite/JJ short/NN ./.
Their/NNP service/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ too/NN and/CC the/DT servers/NNS are/VBP friendly/RB ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN itself/NN is/VBZ bright/JJ and/CC somewhat/JJ spacious/JJ ./.
And/CC most/RBS importantly/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD find/VB the/DT common/JJ goodies/NNS there/RB ./.
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB a/DT few/JJ times/NNS while/IN I/PRP was/VBD visiting/VBG Toronto/NNP because/IN they/PRP have/VBP like/VBN ,/, everything/NN you/PRP 'd/MD ever/RB want/VB for/IN dinner/NN ./.
Seriously/RB ./.
When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT kid/NN ,/, you/PRP could/MD only/RB get/VB these/DT dishes/NNS for/IN like/NN ,/, a/DT special/JJ occassion/NN ./.
But/CC imagine/JJ going/NNS on/IN a/DT random/NN Thursday/NN and/CC ordering/VBG peking/NN duck/NN ,/, and/CC crispy/NN skinned/VBD pork/NN and/CC jelly/RB fish/JJ ,/, delicious/JJ steamed/JJ lobster/NN ./.
Just/RB because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT Thursday/NNP ./.
Soooo/NNP in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, prices/NNS here/RB are/VBP crazy/JJ reasonable/JJ enough/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD come/VB here/RB on/IN a/DT random/NN weekday/NN and/CC decide/VB you/PRP feel/VB like/IN having/NN all/DT those/DT awesome/JJ dishes/NNS you/PRP could/MD only/RB have/VB once/RB a/DT year/NN when/WRB you/PRP were/VBD a/DT kid/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN any/DT regular/JJ Chinese/JJ dinner/NN ./.
Why/NN only/RB the/DT two-stars/NNS then/RB ?/.
Service/NNP here/RB is/VBZ definitely/RB hit/JJ or/CC miss/NN ./.
One/CD time/NN I/PRP went/VBD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD gold/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD ready/JJ to/TO throw/NN down/IN 5/CD stars/NNS ./.
The/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP came/VBD was/VBD for/IN my/NNP mom/NN 's/POS birthday/NN dinner/NN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT big/JJ deal/NN ./.
But/CC everything/NN went/VBD wrong/IN that/DT night/NN ./.
They/PRP messed/VBD up/RP dishes/NNS ,/, things/NNS came/VBD cold/NN ,/, some/DT things/NNS came/VBD tasting/VBG off/NNS ,/, they/PRP sat/VBP us/PRP in/IN an/DT area/NN that/IN was/VBD pretty/RB much/RB a/DT freezer/NN despite/IN the/DT fact/NN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD fairly/RB open/JJ ./.
So/IN you/PRP 'll/MD have/VB to/TO take/VB your/NN chances/NNS with/IN this/DT place/NN ./.
if/IN I/PRP go/VBP back/RB one/CD more/JJR time/NN and/CC the/DT place/NN is/VBZ decent/JJ ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD keep/VB my/PRP$ star/NN rating/NN at/IN 3/CD ./.
Otherwise/RB ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD send/VB another/DT review/NN to/TO drop/VB it/PRP down/IN one/CD ./.
Just/NNP a/DT customer/NN beware/NN sorta/NN deal/NN ./.
You/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN warned/VBN !/.
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN a/DT CNY/NNP dinner/NN so/IN it/PRP was/VBD super/JJ pricey/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD n't/RB there/RB ./.
The/DT waitress/NN did/VBD n't/RB serve/VB the/DT food/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP typically/RB happens/VBZ during/IN holiday/NN dinners/NNS ./.
She/PRP rather/VBD stood/NN around/IN ./.
Do/NNP n't/RB expect/VB service../NN
They/PRP do/VBP have/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS bbq/NN pork/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ entire/JJ life/NN though/IN ./.
Everything/NNP else/NN was/VBD decent/JJ but/CC nothing/NN special/JJ especially/RB considering/VBG it/PRP was/VBD a/DT CNY/NNP dinner/NN ./.
Great/NN prices/NNS ./.
S/NNP ,/, M/NNP ,/, L/NNP all/DT 2ish/CD per/JJ dish/NN ;/: dim/NN sum/NN all/DT day/NN ./.
Lots/NNS of/IN choices/NNS ./.
Cash/NNP only/RB ./.
Def/NNP try/VBD the/DT special/JJ dishes/NNS on/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT menu/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
My/NNP personal/JJ favourites/NNS are/VBP the/DT XO/NNP pan/NN fried/VBD turnip/NN patties/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT duck/NN skin/NN fried/VBN rice/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Really/RB the/DT food/NN would/MD have/VB had/VBN me/VBN coming/VBG back/RB ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD just/RB terrible/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB a/DT high/JJ standard/NN for/IN service/NN when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP at/IN HK/NNP Style/NNP Restaurants/NNPS because/IN unfortunately/RB ,/, poor/NNP service/NNP &/CC HK/NNP restaurants/NNS generally/RB go/VBP hand/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT service/NN is/VBZ efficient/JJ ,/, but/CC poor/RB ./.
Under-staffing/JJ and/CC tip/JJ management/NN is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ reason/NN to/TO blame/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ other/JJ story/NN ,/, for/IN another/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN at/IN this/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD depressing/VBG ./.
I/PRP got/VBD number/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ of/IN 2/CD for/IN me/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ gf/NN ./.
We/PRP 're/VBP a/DT small/JJ table/JJ so/IN it/PRP was/VBD hard/JJ to/TO flag/NN anyone/NN down/IN ./.
The/DT boss/NN is/VBZ too/RB busy/JJ servicing/VBG the/DT big/JJ table/JJ customers/NNS ,/, and/CC so/RB are/VBP the/DT service/NN captains/NNS ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT waitresses/NNS that/WDT finally/RB serviced/VBN our/PRP$ table/JJ did/VBD so/RB very/RB reluctantly/RB ./.
Gave/NNP us/VBD almost/RB a/DT ``/`` god/NN ,/, why/NNS are/VBP you/PRP even/RB here/RB ,/, and/CC sitting/VBG in/IN my/PRP$ section/NN ?/. ''/''
feeling/VBG ./.
The/DT waitress/NN that/IN ended/VBD up/RP servicing/VBG our/PRP$ table/JJ in/IN the/DT end/NN (/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP were/VBD unable/JJ to/TO flag/NN down/IN the/DT same/JJ waitress/NN again/RB )/JJ was/VBD very/RB friendly/RB ./.
