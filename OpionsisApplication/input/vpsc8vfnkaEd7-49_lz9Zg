Too/NNP little/VBD quantity/NN of/IN ordinary/JJ tasting/VBG food/NN ./.

After/IN 36+/CD years/NNS of/IN stuffing/JJ food/NN into/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN (/NN and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN it/PRP at/IN that/IN )/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP hardly/RB ever/RB surprised/VBN any/DT more/RBR by/IN ``/`` good/JJ food/NN ''/'' but/CC yeah/JJ ,/, no/DT ,/, the/DT food/NN at/IN Second/NNP Breakfast/NNP will/MD stun/VB you/PRP ,/, it/PRP will/MD awaken/VB you/PRP ,/, it/PRP will/MD make/VB you/PRP stop/VB shoveling/JJ food/NN into/IN your/PRP$ stomach/NN and/CC convince/NN you/PRP that/IN you/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN something/NN to/TO savor/NN and/CC to/TO chew/NN on/IN for/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN ./.
The/DT crepes/NNS ,/, the/DT waffles/NNS ,/, the/DT DUCK/NNP BACON/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/NNP !/.
Forget/NNP regular/JJ bacon/NN ,/, you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB it/PRP ,/, from/IN now/RB on/IN you/PRP 'll/MD see/VB pigs/NNS only/RB as/IN pets/NNS because/IN the/DT duck/NN bacon/NN is/VBZ just/RB that/IN amazing/NN ./.
If/IN there/EX was/VBD one/CD thing/NN ,/, any/DT little/JJ thing/NN to/TO be/VB critical/JJ of/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT very/RB cool/JJ but/CC not/RB easy/JJ to/TO use/NN wooden/NN flatware/NN but/CC the/DT answer/NN to/TO that/DT is/VBZ to/TO bring/VB you/PRP own/VB because/IN a/DT wooden/NN fork/NN should/MD not/RB stand/VB in/IN your/PRP$ way/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO this/DT amazing/NN and/CC glorious/JJ food/NN that/WDT will/MD change/VB your/JJ life/NN in/IN ways/NNS you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB even/RB imagine/VB ./.
UPDATE/NNP :/: The/DT cool/NN but/CC not/RB easy/JJ to/TO use/NN wooden/NN flatware/NN are/VBP gone/JJ replaced/NN by/IN compostable/JJ plastic-like/NN flatware/NN ./.
So/RB when/WRB we/PRP went/VBD on/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP morning/NN ,/, just/RB after/IN they/PRP 'd/VBP opened/RB ,/, they/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN crepes/NNS ,/, duck/VBP fat/NN ,/, and/CC several/JJ other/JJ items/NNS we/PRP had/VBD hoped/VBN to/TO order/NN ./.
That/DT said/VBD ,/, the/DT waffle/NN was/VBD chewy/NN ,/, moderately/RB sweet/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ with/IN maple/JJ syrup/NN ./.
My/NNP breakfast/VBD buddy/NN and/CC I/PRP shared/VBD some/DT soft/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC duck/NN bacon/NN ,/, which/WDT were/VBD INCREDIBLE/NNP ./.
Like/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD go/VB right/RB away/RB and/CC get/VB some/DT !/NN
Like/IN right/NN now/RB !/.
I/PRP took/VBD away/RB a/DT star/NN because/IN they/PRP were/VBD out/IN of/IN half/PDT the/DT things/NNS we/PRP wanted/RB ,/, and/CC because/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB 30/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ order/NN .../: but/CC man/NN ,/, SO/NNP good/NNP ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB back/RB ,/, and/CC soon/RB !/.
Also/RB ,/, try/VBD out/IN the/DT juice/NN company/NN next/JJ door/NN -/JJ the/DT pineapple/NN green/JJ juice/NN was/VBD delicious/JJ and/CC not-too-sweet/JJ ,/, not-too-green/JJ tasting/NN ./.
A/DT perfect/NN breakfast/NN combo/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD okay/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG a/DT lot/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT stellar/JJ reviews/NNS ./.
I/PRP found/VBD the/DT waffle/NN very/RB dry/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT hash/JJ Browns/NNS too/RB greasy/JJ ./.
The/DT duck/NN Bacon/NNP was/VBD delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP always/RB been/VBN wanting/VBG to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN and/CC finally/RB got/VBD my/PRP$ opportunity/NN ./.
Thom/IN the/DT owner/NN was/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC allowed/JJ me/NNS to/TO sample/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT food/NN ./.
He/PRP explained/VBD to/TO me/PRP how/WRB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ prepared/VBN and/CC i/NN was/VBD very/RB intrigued/VBN !/.
i/NN never/RB thought/VBD I/PRP would/MD like/VB duck/NN bacon/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ !/NN !/NN !/.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD to/TO sample/VB a/DT part/NN of/IN a/DT Belgium/NNP waffle/NN topped/VBD with/IN chocolate/NN and/CC blueberry/JJ sauce/NN ./.
All/IN the/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ organic/JJ and/CC very/RB healthy/JJ !/.
I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB a/DT little/JJ something/NN different/NN by/IN ordering/VBG the/DT Tamagochi/NNP Japanese/NNP omelet/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ made/VBN with/IN 3/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC he/PRP told/VBD me/PRP it/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB as/RB filling/JJ as/IN a/DT traditional/JJ omelet/NN ./.
He/PRP was/VBD right/RB !/JJ !/.
I/PRP really/VBP enjoyed/VBN this/DT omelet/NN ./.
Utensils/NNS are/VBP wooden/VBN but/CC that/DT did/VBD not/RB pose/VB a/DT problem/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
Prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ and/CC of/IN course/NN they/PRP offer/VBP free/JJ Wi-Fi/NNP ./.
There/EX is/VBZ seating/VBG in/IN the/DT back/NN so/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO walk/VB around/RP with/IN your/PRP$ food/NN ./.
Next/NNP time/NN I/PRP return/VBP I/PRP plan/VBP to/TO order/NN complete/IN versions/NNS of/IN the/DT other/JJ items/NNS I/PRP sampled/VBD ./.
Second/NNP Breakfast/NNP is/VBZ located/VBN inside/JJ the/DT Pittsburgh/NNP public/JJ market/NN ./.
Off/NNP street/NN parking/NN is/VBZ available/JJ and/CC there/EX is/VBZ garage/NN parking/VBG nearby/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD not/RB heard/VBN of/IN Second/NNP Breakfast/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN to/TO find/VB their/PRP$ food/NN truck/NN at/IN Saturday/NNP 's/POS Brookline/NNP Breeze/NNP festival/NN on/IN the/DT boulevard/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN looked/VBD great/JJ and/CC I/PRP have/VBP always/RB been/VBN a/DT sucker/NN for/IN a/DT good/JJ waffle/NN ./.
The/DT toppings/NNS ranged/VBD from/IN traditional/JJ maple/NN syrup/NN to/TO those/DT appropriate/NN to/TO satisfy/VB a/DT dessert/NN lovers/NNS sweet/JJ tooth/NN ./.
They/PRP showed/VBD a/DT peach/NN and/CC ginger/JJR topping/NN ,/, two/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ flavors/NNS but/CC had/VBD sold/VBN out/RP ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD on/IN the/DT bacon-brandy-maple/NN syrup/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ choice/NN !/.
The/DT syrup/NN topping/NN enhanced/VBD the/DT waffle/NN without/IN taking/NN anything/NN from/IN that/DT crispy/NN on/IN the/DT outside/JJ but/CC moist/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ on/IN the/DT inside/NN waffle/NN ./.
Another/DT patron/NN had/VBD ordered/VBN ahead/RB of/IN me/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ order/NN of/IN a/DT fried/VBN egg/NN and/CC bacon/NN with/IN potatoes/NNS fried/VBN in/IN duck/JJ fat/NN smelled/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
Wanting/NNP another/DT opportunity/NN to/TO try/VB more/JJR from/IN the/DT menu/NN led/VBD me/PRP here/RB to/TO search/NN for/IN a/DT schedule/NN for/IN their/PRP$ truck/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT website/JJ still/NN shows/VBZ the/DT restaurant/NN that/IN was/VBD (/VBN from/IN a/DT comment/NN by/IN another/DT reviewer/NN )/NN in/IN the/DT Pittsburgh/NNP Public/NNP Market/NNP and/CC nothing/NN about/IN their/PRP$ switch/NN to/TO a/DT food/NN truck/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD keep/VB searching/NN for/IN more/JJR info/NN ,/, but/CC hope/VBD that/IN someone/NN who/WP knows/NNS will/MD post/VB new/JJ info/NN here/RB or/CC let/VB the/DT owners/NNS know/VBP they/PRP need/VBP to/TO update/VB ./.
The/DT Duck/NNP bacon/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG !/NN !/.
Tastiness/NN to/TO the/DT max/NN ./.
Fresh/NNP and/CC local/JJ ingredients/NNS ./.
You/PRP need/VBP to/TO check/NN this/DT spot/NN out/IN !/.
This/DT morning/NN I/PRP was/VBD at/IN PPM/NNP visiting/VBG a/DT friend/NN working/VBG the/DT kombucha/NN stand/VBD (/RB check/JJ out/IN Red/NNP Star/NNP )/NNP when/WRB I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO grab/NN some/DT breakfast/NN ./.
Second/NNP breakfast/NN is/VBZ open/JJ all/DT day/NN which/WDT is/VBZ great/JJ because/IN I/PRP forgot/VBP to/TO eat/NN when/WRB I/PRP woke/VBP up/RP and/CC breakfast/JJ food/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/RB food/NN that/IN anyone/NN truly/RB needs/JJ ,/, right/RB ?/.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT special/JJ which/NN was/VBD a/DT ham/NN ,/, parsnip/NN ,/, cheese/NN and/CC spinach/JJ crepe/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB remember/VB what/WP kind/NN of/IN cheese/NN was/VBD in/IN the/DT crepe/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD creamy/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT crepe/NN was/VBD perfectly/RB thin/JJ and/CC beautiful/JJ ./.
They/PRP also/RB did/VBD not/RB skimp/VB on/IN the/DT ham/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ and/CC fast/NN ./.
I/PRP finally/RB got/VBD to/TO check/NN out/IN second/JJ breakfast/NN as/IN part/NN of/IN an/DT event/NN at/IN the/DT mattress/NN factory/NN today/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP hoping/VBG it/PRP was/VBD just/RB an/DT off/JJ day/NN for/IN them/PRP ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN was/VBD fairly/RB disappointing/JJ ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT worst/NN part/NN was/VBD waiting/VBG about/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS to/TO order/NN and/CC another/DT 45/NN for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN ./.
They/PRP were/VBD also/RB out/IN of/IN a/DT few/JJ things/NNS (/VBP like/IN bacon/NN !/NN !/NN )/.
which/NN is/VBZ understandable/JJ but/CC disappointing/JJ ./.
The/DT volume/NN of/IN customers/NNS did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB very/RB high/JJ for/IN how/WRB long/JJ it/PRP took/VBD ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB really/RB sure/JJ what/NN was/VBD going/VBG on/IN ./.
All/DT that/DT being/NNP said/VBD ,/, the/DT waffles/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ and/CC my/JJ eggs/NNS were/VBD cooked/VBN perfectly/RB ./.
I/PRP also/RB really/RB enjoyed/VBN the/DT hash/JJ brown/NN ./.
The/DT braised/VBD chicken/NN for/IN the/DT chicken/NN and/CC waffles/NNS was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ bland/NN and/CC left/VBD a/DT lot/NN to/TO be/VB desired/VBN ./.
Again/NNP ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP this/DT truck/NN was/VBD just/RB having/VBG an/DT off/JJ day/NN as/IN it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN a/DT great/JJ concept/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN we/PRP wished/VBD we/PRP would/MD have/VB just/RB eaten/VBN at/IN the/DT cafe/NN at/IN the/DT MF/NNP ./.
These/DT are/VBP not/RB everyday/JJ waffles/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP outrageously/RB delicious/JJ and/CC wonderful/JJ ./.
The/DT chef/NN has/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN passion/NN for/IN preparing/VBG top/JJ quality/NN food/NN made/VBD from/IN locally/RB sourced/VBN ingredients/NNS ./.
You/PRP have/VBP to/TO try/VB the/DT duck/NN bacon/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ excellent/JJ ./.
You/PRP will/MD be/VB delighted/VBN by/IN what/WP you/PRP experience/VBP ,/, everything/NN is/VBZ thoughtfully/RB and/CC skillfully/RB prepared/VBN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT great/JJ things/NNS about/IN eating/JJ here/NN is/VBZ all/PDT the/DT other/JJ things/NNS that/WDT are/VBP going/VBG on/IN at/IN the/DT Public/NNP Market/NNP ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, I/PRP dropped/VBD in/IN Saturday/NNP and/CC they/PRP had/VBD live/VBN music/JJ ,/, an/DT old/JJ time/NN jam/NN session/NN that/WDT was/VBD lots/NNS of/IN fun/NN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ also/RB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO shop/NN at/IN all/PDT the/DT other/JJ vendors/NNS ./.
