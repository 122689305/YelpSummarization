I/PRP was/VBD SO/NNP excited/VBD to/TO see/VB Golden/NNP Krust/NNP outside/NNP NY/NNP so/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO stop/NNS in/IN while/NN in/IN the/DT shopping/JJ center/NN ./.
My/NNP curry/JJ goat/NN was/VBD SO/NNP delicious/JJ and/CC had/VBD all/DT the/DT right/JJ flavor/NN and/CC spice/NN ./.

The/DT food/NN is/VBZ ok/JJ but/CC I/PRP tried/VBP it/PRP because/IN of/IN the/DT lunch/NN specials/NNS ./.
I/PRP wanted/VBD Mac/NNP and/CC cheese/NN they/PRP 'd/VBD ran/RB out/IN ./.
Ok/NNP ,/, sucked/VBD that/IN up/IN because/IN I/PRP prob/VBP did/VBD n't/RB need/VB it/PRP anyway/RB ./.

I/PRP really/VBP enjoy/JJ Jamaican/NNP food/NN and/CC was/VBD excited/VBN to/TO see/VB a/DT Golden/NNP Krust/NNP in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN going/VBG to/TO Golden/NNP Krust/NNP since/IN the/DT franchise/NN came/VBD to/TO Charlotte/NNP ./.

Over/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP do/VBP recommend/JJ Gold/NNP Krust/NNP to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ Caribbean/NNP fix/NN ./.
Golden/NNP Krust/NNP is/VBZ a/DT bakery/NN first/RB and/CC their/PRP$ specialty/NN is/VBZ the/DT patty/NN ,/, and/CC other/JJ baked/JJ goods/NNS ,/, they/PRP also/RB serve/VBP Jamaican/JJ staples/NNS such/JJ as/IN oxtails/NNS ,/, fish/JJ ,/, jerk/JJ chicken/NN ,/, and/CC curry/JJ chicken/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT fixins/NNS (/VBP rice/NN and/CC peas/NNS ,/, plantains/NNS ,/, and/CC veggies/NNS )/RB ,/, Ting/NNP ,/, and/CC other/JJ Jamaican/NNP drinks/NNS ./.
With/IN that/DT said/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN patties/NNS look/VBP no/DT further/NN because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP simply/RB the/DT best/JJS ever/NN !/.
Buttery/NNP ,/, flaky/JJ ,/, fat-laden/JJ pastry/NN ,/, filled/VBD with/IN chicken/NN ,/, beef/NN or/CC shrimp/NN !/.
Yes/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT chain/NN and/CC the/DT patties/NNS are/VBP shipped/VBN in/IN but/CC they/PRP 're/VBP baked/VBN in/IN house/NN daily/NN and/CC trust/NN me/IN they/PRP 're/VBP addictive/JJ !/.
Now/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN overall/NN has/VBZ been/VBN fresh/JJ and/CC pretty/RB solid/JJ ,/, but/CC over/IN the/DT years/NNS it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT tad/JJ inconsistent/NN ,/, but/CC everyone/NN has/VBZ a/DT bad/JJ day/NN so/IN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB held/VBN that/IN against/IN them/PRP ./.

The/DT oxtails/NNS and/CC curry/JJ chicken/NNS are/VBP both/DT seasoned/VBN just/RB right/JJ with/IN plenty/NN of/IN gravy/NN .../: .../: .../: it/PRP 's/VBZ all/DT about/IN the/DT gravy/NN ./.
I/PRP know/VBP most/JJ people/NNS think/VBP of/IN jerk/NN chicken/NN when/WRB coming/VBG to/TO Jamaican/NNP restaurants/NNS but/CC since/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT jerk/NN type/NN of/IN chic/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD offer/VB no/DT insight/NN on/IN that/DT entree/NN :/: -/JJ )/NNS Golden/NNP Krust/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN serving/VBG up/RP solid/JJ Jamaican/JJ food/NN in/IN Charlotte/NNP for/IN years/NNS and/CC though/IN there/EX are/VBP other/JJ decent/JJ Caribbean/NNP spots/NNS in/IN the/DT city/NN ,/, I/PRP continue/VBP to/TO return/NN to/TO the/DT Krust/NNP .../: .../: ./.

And/CC they/PRP have/VBP other/JJ specials/NNS daily/JJ while/IN they/PRP last/VBP ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT franchise/NN so/RB like/IN all/DT franchises/NNS there/EX are/VBP certain/JJ guarantees/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN food/NN style/NN and/CC quality/NN and/CC ingredients/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX 's/VBZ also/RB a/DT sense/NN of/IN family/NN here/RB which/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB exist/VB in/IN all/DT offbeat/NN chain/NN restaurants/NNS ./.
Golden/NNP Krust/NNP is/VBZ decent/JJ Caribbean/NNP for/IN fairly/RB cheap/NN prices/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB high/JJ expectations/NNS for/IN service/NN or/CC want/NN to/TO be/VB ``/`` wowed/VBN ''/'' with/IN food/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB too/RB disappointed/JJ ./.

The/DT food/NN itself/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT Jerk/NNP Chicken/NNP and/CC the/DT Curry/NNP Goat/NNP ,/, both/DT of/IN which/WDT were/VBD not/RB too/RB spicy/JJ ./.
The/DT plates/NNS are/VBP served/VBN with/IN generous/JJ helpings/NNS of/IN rice/NN and/CC red/VBD beans/NNS and/CC another/DT side/NN ,/, usually/RB steamed/VBD cabbage/NN or/CC collards/NNS ./.

A/DT total/JJ take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move/NN attitude/NN pervades/VBZ this/DT place/NN ./.

Outside/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN does/VBZ n't/RB due/JJ justice/NN to/TO what/WP deliciousness/NN is/VBZ served/VBN inside/NN !/.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO cut/VB portions/NNS on/IN the/DT meats/NNS at/IN least/JJS put/CD a/DT good/JJ portion/NN of/IN rice/NN so/IN you/PRP feel/VBP like/IN you/PRP got/VBD something../NN

imho/NN
Pretty/NNP good/VBD Caribbean/NNP Food/NNP ,/, Nice/NNP location/NN ,/, and/CC decent/JJ service/NN ./.
They/PRP use/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT lot/NN better/RBR years/NNS ago/RB ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ overpriced/NN for/IN the/DT portions/NNS you/PRP get/VB ,/, but/CC overall/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ ok/NN and/CC I/PRP 'll/MD probably/RB return/VB
Bland/NNP food/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB know/VB how/WRB you/PRP can/MD make/VB jerk/NN chicken/NN bland/NN but/CC they/PRP managed/VBP ./.
The/DT customer/NN service/NN is/VBZ mediocre/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB recommend/VBP going/VBG elsewhere/RB ./.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN quite/RB a/DT few/JJ times/NNS and/CC always/RB received/VBD pretty/RB decent/JJ service/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ always/RB tasty/JJ and/CC never/RB really/RB found/VBN that/IN service/NN was/VBD an/DT issue/NN until/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ visit/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT Jamaican/JJ visitor/NN and/CC she/PRP want/VBP hard/JJ dough/NN bread/VBD to/TO go/VB with/IN our/PRP$ dinner/NN ./.
Now/RB I/PRP could/MD have/VB gone/VBN a/DT couple/NN of/IN different/JJ places/NNS but/CC I/PRP chose/VBP the/DT Bakery/NNP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT bread/JJ but/CC I/PRP typically/RB only/RB eat/VB it/PRP when/WRB in/IN NY/NNP ,/, Jamaica/NNP or/CC Florida/NNP because/IN I/PRP need/VBP my/JJ hard/NN dough/NN to/TO be/VB as/RB fresh/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.
While/IN the/DT seemingly/RB nice/JJ woman/NN was/VBD ringing/VBG me/PRP up/RP I/PRP politely/RB asked/VBD ``/`` how/WRB old/JJ is/VBZ the/DT bread/JJ ?/. ''/''
Now/RB I/PRP know/VBP this/DT is/VBZ called/VBN a/DT bakery/NN but/CC everyone/NN knows/VBZ their/PRP$ baked/JJ goods/NNS are/VBP shipped/VBN in/IN ./.
She/PRP responds/VBZ by/IN saying/NN ``/`` the/DT bread/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ ./. ''/''
I/PRP say/VBP your/JJ idea/NN of/IN fresh/JJ and/CC mine/JJ maybe/NN 2/CD different/JJ things/NNS ./.
She/PRP became/VBD a/DT maniac/NN but/CC in/IN a/DT calm/NN way/NN ./.
She/PRP asks/VBZ :/: do/VBP you/PRP want/VB the/DT bread/NN or/CC not/RB ?/.
At/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP really/RB just/RB needed/VBN to/TO get/VB the/DT bread/NN and/CC leave/NN ,/, dinner/NN was/VBD waiting/VBG ./.
But/CC not/RB before/IN I/PRP explained/VBD that/IN as/IN a/DT consumer/NN and/CC patron/NN of/IN this/DT store/NN I/PRP have/VBP a/DT right/NN to/TO know/VB how/WRB old/JJ something/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT darn/JJ bakery/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB bake/VB anything/NN ./.
After/IN the/DT fact/NN ,/, i/NN was/VBD very/RB upset/JJ because/IN I/PRP could/MD have/VB gone/NN somewhere/RB else/RB ,/, and/CC for/IN her/PRP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP was/VBD OK/VBN to/TO respond/VB in/IN that/DT manner/NN bothered/VBD me/PRP ./.
Why/NN was/VBD she/PRP so/RB combative/JJ in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ?/.
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, she/PRP told/VBD me/PRP their/PRP$ shipments/NNS come/VBP every/DT Tuesday/NNP ./.
So/RB this/DT would/MD be/VB the/DT best/JJS day/NN to/TO visit/NN if/IN you/PRP need/VBP baked/VBN goods/NNS ./.
I/PRP myself/VBP ,/, will/MD never/RB spend/VB another/DT nickel/NN there/RB ./.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ NOT/NNP Caribbean/NNP food/NN !/.
It/PRP 's/VBZ terrible/JJ ./.
You/PRP must/MD ask/VB for/IN a/DT drink/NN separate/NN from/IN the/DT combo/NN even/RB though/IN you/PRP 've/VBP ordered/VBN a/DT combo/NN ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO offer/VB it/PRP to/TO you/PRP either/VB ./.
The/DT food/NN tastes/VBZ horrible/JJ ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP could/MD sit/VB outside/NN and/CC turn/JJ people/NNS around/IN to/TO save/VB their/PRP$ souls/NNS ./.
But/CC unfortunately/RB this/DT is/VBZ all/DT I/PRP can/MD do/VB ./.
Take/IN heed/JJ and/CC go/VB elsewhere/RB !/VBN !/NN !/NN !/.
!/NN
The/DT jerk/NN sauce/NN tastes/NNS like/IN bbq/NN sauce/NN from/IN a/DT bottle/NN mixed/VBN with/IN ketchup/NN !/.
I/PRP should/MD 've/VB known/VBN to/TO keep/VB walking/NN when/WRB I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB see/VB any/DT customers/NNS ./.
Never/NNP again/RB ./.
Golden/NNP Krust/NNP really/RB does/VBZ live/VB up/RP to/TO the/DT name/NN ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP Jerk/NNP Chicken/NNP with/IN a/DT shrimp/NN Jamaican/NNP patty/NN ./.
The/DT Jamaican/NNP patty/NN had/VBD such/JJ a/DT crispy/NN ,/, well/RB put/VBN together/RB crust/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD probably/RB the/DT best/JJS Jamaican/JJ patty/NN I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN the/DT Charlotte/NNP area/NNP &/CC you/NNP like/IN Caribbean/NNP food/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT spot/NN to/TO look/VB into/IN ./.
Love/NNP the/DT veggie/NN patties/NNS ,/, when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP available/JJ .../NNS have/VBP n't/RB really/RB eaten/VB anything/NN else/RB there/RB ./.
The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT mood/NN for/IN Jamaican/NNP food/NN this/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
The/DT sell/NN cakes/VBZ and/CC patties/NNS which/WDT are/VBP very/RB good/JJ ./.
They/PRP get/VBP a/DT four/CD star/NN because/IN their/PRP$ portions/NNS could/MD be/VB better/RBR for/IN the/DT price/NN ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN awhile/JJ since/IN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN to/TO Golden/NNP Krust/NNP and/CC I/PRP remembered/VBD this/DT place/NN being/VBG pretty/RB good/JJ but/CC things/NNS have/VBP sadly/RB changed/VBN ./.
Walking/NNP into/IN the/DT restaurant/JJ it/PRP was/VBD extremely/RB humid/JJ and/CC hot/NN so/IN I/PRP assume/VBP the/DT air/NN condition/NN was/VBD not/RB working/RB ./.
My/NNP family/NN and/CC I/PRP proceeded/VBD to/TO order/NN since/IN we/PRP were/VBD starving/VBG ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT Curry/NNP chicken/NN with/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS and/CC cabbage/NN ,/, Oxtails/NNS with/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS and/CC cabbage/NN and/CC Jerk/NNP Chicken/NNP with/IN rice/NN and/CC beans/NNS and/CC cabbage/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB added/VBD 2/CD spicy/NN beef/NN pattys/NNS ,/, they/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB any/DT more/JJR regular/JJ beef/NN pattys/NNS ,/, I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ ./.
With/IN it/PRP being/VBD so/RB hot/NN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN I/PRP wanted/VBD a/DT Large/NNP ice/NN water/NN BUT/NNP their/PRP$ fountain/NN drink/NN machine/NN was/VBD not/RB working/JJ and/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB any/DT bottle/NN waters/NNS ./.
The/DT only/JJ drinks/NNS that/WDT were/VBD available/JJ were/VBD bottled/VBN juices/NNS that/IN I/PRP was/VBD not/RB interested/JJ in/IN ./.

After/IN returning/NN with/IN my/PRP$ large/JJ drink/NN in/IN hand/NN my/NN family/NN and/CC I/PRP ate/VBP dinner/NN ./.
The/DT curry/JJ chicken/NN was/VBD my/RB favorite/JJ out/IN of/IN all/PDT the/DT entrees/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBP but/CC I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ plantains/NNS were/VBD very/RB soggy/JJ and/CC not/RB fried/VBD long/RB enough/RB ./.
The/DT oxtails/NNS disappointed/VBD me/RB the/DT most/RBS ./.
They/PRP were/VBD not/RB seasoned/VBN and/CC did/VBD not/RB really/RB have/VB a/DT taste/NN ./.
Overall/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN here/RB was/VBD just/RB ok/JJ ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP Golden/VBN Krust/NNP improves/VBZ the/DT obvious/JJ issues/NNS and/CC bring/VB back/RP the/DT original/JJ Golden/NNP Krust/NNP ./.
The/DT roti/NN here/RB is/VBZ an/DT improvement/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ Jamaican/NNP restaurants/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP eaten/VBN at/IN in/IN Charlotte/NNP ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP from/IN Brooklyn/NNP ,/, so/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP used/JJ to/TO having/VB maximum/NN food/NN for/IN a/DT great/JJ price/NN ./.
Not/RB so/RB in/IN Charlotte/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT minimal/JJ amount/NN of/IN oxtail/NN ,/, the/DT price/NN could/MD be/VB a/DT bit/JJ lower/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN to/TO pay/VB a/DT high/JJ price/NN for/IN lots/NNS of/IN rice/NN and/CC cabbage/NN but/CC a/DT scoop/NN of/IN oxtail/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP definitely/RB not/RB expecting/VBG oxtails/NNS to/TO dominate/VB the/DT plate/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT serving/VBG my/NN daughter/NN had/VBD was/VBD enough/RB to/TO convince/NN me/IN I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB getting/VBN anything/NN other/JJ than/IN beef/NN patties/NNS here/RB ./.
That/DT is/VBZ ,/, when/WRB they/PRP actually/RB have/VBP any/DT available/JJ ./.
Right/NNP off/VBD the/DT bat/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB go/VB to/TO this/DT place/NN expecting/VBG warm/NN and/CC cheery/NN service/NN ./.
Just/NNP focus/VBD on/IN the/DT food/NN to/TO keep/VB your/PRP$ satisfaction/NN levels/NNS in/IN check/NN ./.
I/PRP met/VBD some/DT friends/NNS here/RB after/IN work/NN based/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ recommendation/NN ./.
When/WRB we/PRP got/VBP there/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD empty/JJ (/NN this/DT was/VBD around/IN 5:30/CD on/IN a/DT Monday/NNP evening/NN )/NN but/CC definitely/RB picked/VBD up/RP as/IN time/NN passed/NNS ./.
This/DT was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ time/NN eating/VBG Jamaican/NNP food/NN (/NN I/PRP know/VBP !/JJ )/NN

The/DT Jamaican/NNP soda/NN was/VBD very/RB sweet/JJ ,/, which/WDT should/MD come/VB as/IN no/DT surprise/NN since/IN its/PRP$ second/JJ ingredient/NN is/VBZ high/JJ fructose/NN corn/NN syrup/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB not/RB anything/VB I/PRP would/MD probably/RB have/VB again/RB but/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ enough/NN to/TO wash/VB down/RP my/PRP$ patty/NN ./.
I/PRP got/VBD to/TO taste/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS '/POS meals/NNS and/CC I/PRP really/RB ,/, really/RB enjoyed/VBD the/DT jerk/NN chicken/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ definitely/RB some/DT I/PRP would/MD order/VB on/IN my/PRP$ next/JJ visit/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ spot/NN for/IN some/DT of/IN your/PRP$ Caribbean/NNP needs/NNP ./.
You/PRP should/MD definitely/RB check/VB it/PRP out/IN at/IN least/JJS once/RB if/IN you/PRP find/VBP yourself/NN in/IN the/DT University/NNP Area/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ small/JJ and/CC tucked/VBD away/RP in/IN the/DT shopping/JJ center/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP visibly/RB see/VBP the/DT sign/NN for/IN the/DT place/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ n't/RB that/IN big/JJ ,/, so/RB you/PRP for/IN sure/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB overwhelmed/VBN with/IN too/RB many/JJ choices/NNS ./.
I/PRP have/VBP gone/VBN here/RB twice/JJ now/RB and/CC definitely/RB recommend/VB the/DT Goat/NNP Curry/NNP or/CC the/DT Oxtail/NNP meal/NN ./.

Kinda/NNP a/DT bummer/NN on/IN that/DT part/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP tables/NNS near/IN the/DT register/NN ,/, and/CC also/RB near/IN the/DT back/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN towards/NNS the/DT back/NN to/TO see/VB how/WRB many/JJ tables/NNS there/EX are/VBP as/IN I/PRP have/VBP only/RB gotten/VBN take/JJ out/NN ./.
The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP a/DT little/JJ pricey/NN to/TO me/PRP ,/, but/CC the/DT food/NN was/VBD worth/JJ it/PRP ./.

The/DT prices/NNS are/VBP cheap/NN so/IN you/PRP tend/VBP to/TO get/VB idiots/NNS in/IN there/NN who/WP have/VBP no/DT manners/NNS ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP ,/, taking/VBG the/DT food/NN to/TO go/VB or/CC sitting/VBG in/IN the/DT back/NN ./.
This/DT food/NN was/VBD not/RB my/JJ favorite/JJ I/PRP spent/VBD about/IN $/$ 12/CD and/CC barely/RB ate/VB any/DT of/IN it/PRP ./.

Best/NNP for/IN lunch/NN $/$ 5-6/CD ,/, and/CC dinner/VB $/$ 8-10/CD ./.
Ive/NNP been/VBD going/VBG here/RB for/IN yrs/NNS .../: as/IN a/DT NYer/NNP I/PRP 'm/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT chain/NN ./.
The/DT foods/NNS good/JJ but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP never/RB going/VBG back/RB ./.

The/DT patties/NNS are/VBP worthy/JJ of/IN 6/NNP stars/NNS ,/, the/DT only/RB reason/VBN I/PRP gave/VBD the/DT 4/NN stars/NNS is/VBZ because/IN every/DT time/NN I/PRP visit/VBD the/DT music/JJ is/VBZ blaring/VBG and/CC the/DT air/NN conditioning/VBG seems/NN to/TO be/VB turned/VBN off/RP or/CC not/RB working/VBG ./.
