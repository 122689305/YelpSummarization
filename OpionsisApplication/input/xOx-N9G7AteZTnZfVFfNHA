This/DT is/VBZ my/JJ 9/NN year/NN olds/VBZ review/NN ./.
Hamburgers/NNS are/VBP great/JJ and/CC the/DT cheese/NN curds/NNS are/VBP awesome/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT Great/JJ Lake/NNP View/NNP
So/IN I/PRP know/VBP Christy/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ a/DT Madison/NN tradition/NN with/IN those/DT lovely/JJ views/NNS of/IN Lake/NNP Waubesa/NNP ./.
But/CC this/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT one-track/JJ pony/NN .../: location/NN ,/, location/NN ,/, location/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT family-owned/JJ bar/restaurant/NN and/CC the/DT owners/NNS know/VBP they/PRP have/VBP a/DT captive/JJ audience/NN ./.
The/DT beer/NN is/VBZ cold/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN is/VBZ average/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ atrocious/JJ ./.
On/IN a/DT recent/JJ beautiful/JJ Saturday/NNP afternoon/NN ,/, there/EX were/VBD only/RB two/CD servers/NNS for/IN the/DT outside/JJ seating/VBG area/NN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ no/DT host/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP (/VBP 4/VBN adults/NNS and/CC 1/CD kid/NN )/NN sat/NN at/IN a/DT picnic/JJ table/JJ and/CC proceeded/VBD to/TO wait/NN at/IN least/JJS 10/CD minutes/NNS to/TO no/DT avail/NN ./.
We/PRP eventually/VBP went/JJ inside/NN to/TO order/NN drinks/NNS and/CC lunch/NN ./.
At/IN no/DT time/NN during/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN did/VBD a/DT server/NN ever/RB approach/JJ our/NN table/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/MD certainly/RB be/VB inclined/VBN to/TO write/VB off/RP this/DT awful/JJ experience/NN to/TO a/DT bad/JJ day/NN or/CC poor/JJ staffing/NN ,/, but/CC unfortunately/RB this/DT is/VBZ more/RBR the/DT rule/NN rather/RB than/IN exception/NN ./.
One/CD really/RB weird/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ the/DT Friday/NNP Fish/NNP Fry/NNP that/IN features/NNS a/DT special/JJ menu/NN available/JJ ONLY/NNP inside/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB communicated/VBN very/RB well/RB ;/: so/IN you/PRP 'll/MD grab/VB a/DT table/JJ outside/NN ,/, wait/NN to/TO order/NN only/RB to/TO learn/NN you/PRP can/MD only/RB order/VB from/IN the/DT pizza/sandwich/NN menu/NN ./.
Great/NNP scenery/NN ./.

A/DT must/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN !/.
!/NN
This/DT place/NN has/VBZ such/JJ potential/JJ but/CC the/DT service/NN SUCKS/NNP !/.
And/CC I/PRP wrote/VBD that/IN in/IN capital/NN letters/NNS on/IN purpose/NN ./.
You/PRP literally/RB have/VBP to/TO stare/VB a/DT waitress/NN down/IN and/CC even/RB if/IN you/PRP make/VBP eye/JJ contact/NN you/PRP 're/VBP lucky/JJ if/IN they/PRP will/MD stop/VB at/IN your/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
Come/NN on/IN !/NN
We/PRP boat/VBD on/IN the/DT lake/NN and/CC wish/JJ there/NNS were/VBD better/RBR options/JJ than/IN this/DT ./.
I/PRP guess/VBZ it/PRP 's/VBZ Waypoint/NNP every/NNP time/NN !/.
As/IN a/DT side/NN note/NN :/: I/PRP 'm/VBP writing/VBG this/DT on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP afternoon/NN as/IN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN sitting/VBG at/IN an/DT outside/JJ table/JJ for/IN over/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS without/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT three/CD servers/NNS currently/RB working/VBG even/RB acknowledging/VBG us/PRP !/.
I/PRP really/VBP wanted/VBG the/DT Shrimp/NNP Christy/NNP 's/POS ./.
(/RB Because/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ fantastic/JJ !/NN )/.
Oh/NNP well/RB ./.
There/EX probably/RB wo/MD n't/RB be/VB a/DT next/JJ time/NN either/NN !/.
Unless/IN you/PRP 're/VBP a/DT local/JJ yokel/NN McFarland/NNP douchebag/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB get/VB any/DT measure/NN of/IN service/NN here/RB ./.
After/IN waiting/VBG more/JJR than/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS for/IN a/DT server/NN outside/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD inside/JJ to/TO inquire/NN of/IN outdoor/JJ food/NN service/NN ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, since/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT regular/JJ inebriated/VBN bar/NN flies/NNS ,/, getting/VBG the/DT attention/NN of/IN a/DT bartender/NN is/VBZ nearly/RB impossible/JJ ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB not/RB loud/VB enough/RB ,/, drunk/VBP enough/RB ,/, or/CC both/DT ./.
And/CC once/RB I/PRP did/VBD get/VB his/PRP$ ear/NN ,/, the/DT next/JJ local/JJ loudmouth/NN douche/NN bag/NN stumbles/VBZ up/RP to/TO the/DT bar/NN and/CC interupts/NNS me/PRP to/TO order/VB his/PRP$ next/JJ round/NN of/IN Captain/NNP and/CC Cokes/NNP (/NNP classy/NN )/NN ./.

It/PRP appeared/VBD to/TO have/VB been/VBN placed/VBN briefly/RB under/IN a/DT hot/NN broiler/NN as/IN the/DT top/NN was/VBD charred/VBN and/CC any/DT buried/JJ shredded/JJ cheese/NN was/VBD unmelted/JJ ./.
The/DT result/NN was/VBD a/DT very/RB dry/JJ dish/JJ that/IN required/NNP multiple/JJ cups/NNS of/IN salsa/NN to/TO provide/VB flavor/NN and/CC moisture/NN ./.
Note/NN :/: This/DT review/NN was/VBD written/VBN during/IN the/DT summer/NN of/IN 2014/CD but/CC I/PRP just/RB found/VBD it/PRP in/IN my/PRP$ Drafts/NNS --/: sorry/JJ for/IN the/DT delay/NN !/.

What/WP the/DT waitress/NN offered/VBD as/IN the/DT special/NN was/VBD not/RB what/WP was/VBD delivered/RB ./.
After/IN we/PRP asked/VBD ,/, she/PRP still/RB did/VBD n't/RB know/VB what/WP was/VBD included/VBN with/IN the/DT dinner/NN ./.

The/DT lady/NN tried/VBD hard/RB ,/, so/RB she/PRP earned/VBD a/DT good/JJ tip/NN ./.
The/DT kitchen/NN and/CC management/NN could/MD do/VB a/DT lot/NN better/RBR ./.
Probably/RB will/MD not/RB go/VB here/RB again/RB for/IN dinner/NN ./.
Too/NNP bad/NNP because/IN we/PRP do/VBP like/IN the/DT place/NN overall/NN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO Christy/NNP 's/POS quite/JJ a/DT few/JJ times/NNS over/IN the/DT years/NNS and/CC have/VBP never/RB had/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ meal/NN ;/: however/RB ,/, last/JJ night/NN 's/POS meal/NN was/VBD a/DT disaster/NN !/.
It/PRP started/VBD with/IN the/DT bartender/NN getting/VBG our/NN drink/NN order/NN wrong/NN ,/, One/CD member/NN of/IN our/PRP$ party/NN received/VBD a/DT different/JJ potato/NN than/IN ordered/NNP ,/, 1/NNP had/VBD a/DT different/JJ salad/JJ dressing/NN than/IN ordered/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD the/DT worst/NN fish/JJ fry/NN EVER/NNP ./.

The/DT other/JJ times/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ only/RB mediocre/NN for/IN bar/NN food/NN at/IN best/JJS ./.
