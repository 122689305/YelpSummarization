Amazing/VBG place/NN downtown/NN Oakville/NNP that/IN makes/NNP you/PRP feel/VBP very/RB welcome/JJ and/CC has/VBZ a/DT downtown/NN Toronto/NNP feel/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ open/JJ a/DT bit/NN later/JJ than/IN other/JJ places/NNS in/IN Oakville/NNP therefore/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ for/IN the/DT night/NN owl/NN crowd/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN there/RB at/IN least/JJS 3/CD times/NNS and/CC there/EX is/VBZ usually/RB some/DT party/NN going/VBG on/IN ./.
Later/NNP in/IN the/DT evening/NN they/PRP play/VBP music/JJ and/CC have/VBP the/DT most/RBS interesting/JJ Japanese/JJ Anime/NN or/CC Sumo/NNP wrestling/NN on/IN a/DT big/JJ screen/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ authentic/JJ and/CC high/JJ quality/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ rolls/NNS are/VBP amazing/VBG ./.
But/CC what/WP makes/VBZ this/DT restaurant/NN such/VBD a/DT hit/NN is/VBZ the/DT personal/JJ staff/NN and/CC bartenders/NNS who/WP make/VB everyone/NN feel/NNS like/IN a/DT regular/JJ ./.
They/PRP greet/VBD everyone/NN in/IN Japanese/JJ ./.

My/NNP GF/NNP and/CC I/PRP ate/VBP at/IN Fin/NNP 's/POS on/IN Saturday/NNP night/NNP Sept/NNP 21/NNP ,/, 2013/CD ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT chef/NN 's/POS special/JJ tasting/NN box/NN which/WDT had/VBD 9/VBN different/JJ items/NNS ./.
The/DT honey/NN topped/VBD eggplant/NN was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ but/CC everything/NN else/NN was/VBD mundane/JJ at/IN best/JJS ./.
There/EX were/VBD rubbery/JJ little/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN octopus/NNS with/IN much/JJ chopped/VBN vegetables/NNS in/IN a/DT sauce/NN that/WDT overwhelmed/VBN everything/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD spicy/JJ salmon/NN which/WDT was/VBD not/RB spicy/JJ and/CC was/VBD overwhelmed/VBN by/IN a/DT massive/JJ amount/NN of/IN mayo/NN ./.
The/DT tuna/NN was/VBD tasteless/JJ ./.
Etc/NNP ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT decor/NN is/VBZ primitive/JJ and/CC the/DT place/NN is/VBZ incredibly/RB loud/VBN for/IN a/DT supposedly/RB upscale/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB not/RB a/DT good/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD not/RB return/VB ./.
What/WP a/DT gem/NN !/.
I/PRP 'm/VBP so/RB happy/JJ I/PRP wandered/VBD into/IN FIn/NNP !/.
Since/IN moving/VBG to/TO Oakville/NNP I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN searching/VBG for/IN as/IN many/JJ Toronto-esque/JJ restaurants/NNS as/IN possible/JJ so/RB i/JJ can/MD get/VB my/PRP$ fill/NN !/.
I/PRP 've/VBP found/VBN a/DT few/JJ great/JJ places/NNS there/RB ,/, but/CC no/DT food/NN (/NN especially/RB Asian/JJ )/NN has/VBZ actually/RB been/VBN that/IN great/JJ -/NN until/IN Fin/NNP !/.
I/PRP went/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP evening/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD concerned/VBN it/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB open/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD until/IN 10/CD PM/NNP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD greeted/VBN in/IN Japanese/JJ and/CC seated/VBN immediately/RB by/IN our/PRP$ extremely/JJ friendly/NN and/CC attentive/JJ server/NN ./.
Food/NNP is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT pricey/NN side/NN ,/, but/CC without/IN there/RB being/VBG much/JJ competition/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN Izakaya/NNP in/IN Oakville/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB surprised/VBN ,/, and/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB break/VB the/DT bank/NN ./.
Personal/NNP favorites/NNS were/VBD the/DT selection/NN of/IN fish/JJ for/IN three/CD (/NNS see/VBP picture/NN ,/, so/RB beautiful/JJ !/NN )/.

Overall/NNP i/NNP was/VBD super/NN impressed/VBN with/IN the/DT quality/NN and/CC variety/NN of/IN food/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT service/NN ./.
I/PRP could/MD n't/RB recommend/VB Fin/NNP enough/RB to/TO those/DT starved/VBN for/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN Asian/JJ food/NN in/IN Oakville/NNP !/.

If/IN someone/NN could/MD translate/VB what/WP is/VBZ yelled/JJ at/IN patrons/NNS once/RB they/PRP enter/VBP ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB greatly/RB appreciated/VBN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP assume/VB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT greeting/NN ./.
The/DT friendly/JJ staff/NN that/WDT helped/-NONE- us/PRP explained/VBD that/IN the/DT general/JJ restaurant/NN experience/NN is/VBZ that/IN of/IN arriving/VBG ,/, eating/VBG and/CC then/RB leaving/VBD to/TO go/VB enjoy/JJ something/NN else/RB ,/, somewhere/RB else/RB ./.

Any/NNP way/NN ,/, food/NN :/: In/IN absence/NN of/IN a/DT bread/JJ basket/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP given/VBN what/WP is/VBZ called/VBN thin/JJ spaghetti/NN ,/, coated/VBD in/IN salt/NN and/CC flavoured/VBD with/IN a/DT spicy/NN curry/NN ./.

A/DT little/JJ tricky/NN to/TO pick/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT chop/NN sticks/NNS ,/, as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ chopped/VBN rather/RB finely/RB ,/, but/CC worth/IN the/DT effort/NN ./.
The/DT Deep/NNP Fried/NNP Prawns/NNS are/VBP quite/JJ massive/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ on/IN the/DT garlic/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT spicy/NN sauce/NN make/VBP 'em/JJ quite/RB a/DT lovely/RB plate/NN and/CC pretty/RB to/TO look/VB at/IN once/RB delivered/RB ./.
As/IN the/DT evening/NN progresses/NNS ,/, more/JJR and/CC more/JJR residents/NNS of/IN Oakville/NNP filter/NN in/IN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN bumping/NN and/CC jockeying/VBG for/IN room/NN in/IN this/DT narrow/NN little/RB space/NN ./.
