Un/IN endroit/JJ charmant/NN ,/, pas/VBZ fancy/JJ du/NN tout/NN ./.
Le/NNP seul/NN point/NN négatif/NN que/JJ je/NN peux/NN voir/CC est/JJS que/JJ l'espace/NN est/JJS très/NNS limité/NN ,/, environ/VB 15/CD places/NNS seulement/NN ,/, donc/NN le/NN resto/NN est/JJS presque/JJ toujours/NNS plein/VBP et/JJ ce/NN n'est/JJS pas/NNS un/JJ endroit/JJ que/JJ je/NN recommanderai/NN pour/JJ un/JJ groupe/NN ou/NN pour/JJ occuper/NN un/JJ coin/NN à/NN jaser/NN trop/NN longtemps/NNS ,/, évidemment/NN ./.

Les/NNP burgers/NNS ont/VBD vraiment/NN un/JJ goût/NN unique/JJ et/NN bien/NN à/NN eux/NN ./.

Ce/NNP resto/NNP est/JJS si/NN petit/NN qu'il/NN y/NN a/DT rarement/NN des/VBZ places/NNS disponibles/NNS ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS poutine/NN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ,/, though/IN the/DT best/JJS part/NN to/TO me/PRP were/VBD the/DT mini/NN burgers/NNS that/WDT start/NN at/IN a/DT mere/RB $/$ 2.50/CD ./.
The/DT place/NN is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, so/RB be/VB willing/JJ to/TO wait/NN if/IN you/PRP intend/VBP to/TO stay/NNS and/CC eat/NN ./.
Needless/NNP to/TO say/VB ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB worth/JJ it/PRP ./.

Great/NNP spot/NN !/.
Well/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO eat/VB the/DT poutine/NN ./.
Although/IN ..to/NNP me/NNP ,/, dark/VBP fries/NNS like/IN that/DT usually/NN signal/VBD dirty/JJ cooking/NN oil/NN ./.
Here/NNP is/VBZ my/VBG major/JJ complaint/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN fruit/JJ flies/NNS in/IN the/DT place/NN ./.
It/PRP kind/VBD of/IN made/NN me/NN sick/NN to/TO my/PRP$ stomach/NN ./.
This/DT to/TO me/PRP ,/, signifies/NNS .../: dirty/JJ ,/, unclean/JJ ,/, not/RB hygienic/JJ enough/RB ./.
Some/DT people/NNS give/VBP the/DT excuse/JJ you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB control/VB the/DT fruit/NN flies/NNS ,/, but/CC i/RB have/VBP always/RB found/VBN it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB places/VBZ that/IN arent/JJ regularly/RB cleaned/VBN deeply/RB .../: and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB once/RB a/DT month/NN ./.

Nice/NNP staff..when/NN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB shout/VB out/RP how/WRB much/JJ the/DT last/JJ customer/NN tipped/VBD them/PRP in/IN front/NN of/IN you/PRP .../VBP .../: .It/NNP 's/POS not/RB the/DT best/JJS place/NN in/IN Montreal/NNP ./.
We/PRP stopped/VBD by/IN here/RB specifically/RB for/IN the/DT poutine/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN itself/PRP felt/VBD like/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN neighborhood/NN joint/NNS with/IN a/DT bunch/NN of/IN regulars/NNS and/CC fun/JJ ,/, wisecracking/JJ staff/NN ./.
Judging/VBG from/IN the/DT interactions/NNS between/IN the/DT customers/NNS and/CC the/DT waiters/cooks/NNS ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP it/PRP was/VBD ./.
The/DT poutine/NN was/VBD good/JJ ,/, very/RB rich/JJ ,/, and/CC no/DT doubt/NN ranks/VBZ highly/RB as/RB far/RB as/IN poutine/NN goes/VBZ in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT four/CD or/CC five/CD bucks/NNS that/IN it/PRP ran/VBD us/PRP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ of/IN hoping/NN for/IN something/NN more/RBR ./.

PECULIAR/NNP
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT tradition/NN every/DT time/NN we/PRP come/VBP to/TO Montreal/NNP ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ small/JJ and/CC cozy/JJ ./.
They/PRP know/VBP the/DT value/NN of/IN a/DT good/JJ salad/NN with/IN a/DT side/NN of/IN hand-cut/NN fries/NNS ./.

Most/JJ people/NNS do/VBP take/RB out/RP though/IN ./.

Definitely/RB enjoyed/VBN it/PRP ./.
Fries/NNS were/VBD thin/JJ cut/NN and/CC the/DT curds/NNS were/VBD extra/JJ squeaky/JJ ./.
The/DT gravy/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT little/JJ salter/NN side/NN but/CC definitely/RB worth/VBD the/DT calories/NNS here/RB !/.
For/IN 6/CD $/$ before/CD tax/CD you/PRP get/VB a/DT whooping/JJ amount/NN of/IN poutine/NN ./.
Servers/NNS and/CC owner/NN are/VBP also/RB super/JJ friendly/RB guys/VBZ
The/DT poutine/NN is/VBZ obviously/RB highly/RB recommended/VBN here/RB ,/, but/CC other/JJ reviews/NNS tend/VBP to/TO downplay/VB the/DT other/JJ food/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ poutine/NN experience/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT fan/JJ .../NN but/CC this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB their/PRP$ fault/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB care/VB for/IN the/DT dish/JJ in/IN general/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN at/IN how/WRB good/JJ the/DT burgers/NNS were/VBD ./.
Like/IN everyone/NN says/VBZ ,/, the/DT price/NN point/NN is/VBZ ideal/JJ ./.

I/PRP had/VBD heard/VBN a/DT lot/NN about/IN this/DT place/NN 's/POS poutines/NNS from/IN friends/NNS and/CC finally/RB tried/VBD them/PRP last/JJ night/NN ./.

I/PRP came/VBD here/RB for/IN the/DT poutine/NN ,/, but/CC noticed/VBD they/PRP also/RB serve/VBP borscht/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP got/VBD that/IN as/IN an/DT appetizer/NN ./.
The/DT borscht/NN was/VBD more/RBR a/DT creamy/NN soup/NN than/IN the/DT hearty/NN vegetable/JJ soup/NN you/PRP might/MD be/VB expecting/VBG ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD beautifully/RB beety/JJ ./.

As/IN noted/VBD by/IN others/NNS ,/, the/DT venue/NN IS/NNP small/JJ -/NN and/CC I/PRP like/IN it/PRP that/IN way/NN ./.
The/DT poutine/NN ,/, both/DT plain/original/NN and/CC the/DT one/CD with/IN bell/NN pepper/NN and/CC olives/NNS ,/, was/VBD delicious/JJ !/.
Better/NNP than/IN at/IN Rapido/NNP (/NNP ugh/JJ ./. )/''
and/CC on/IN par/NN with/IN La/NNP Banquise/NNP 's/POS classic/JJ ./.
At/IN that/DT time/NN of/IN day/NN it/PRP was/VBD busy/JJ but/CC not/RB jam/VB packed/JJ ,/, and/CC service/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.
Not/RB stressed/VBN ,/, with/IN a/DT relaxed/VBN and/CC casual/JJ vibe/NN ./.
The/DT guy/JJ serving/NN was/VBD super/NN nice/NN and/CC friendly/RB ,/, laughing/NN and/CC joking/VBG with/IN us/PRP ./.
He/PRP even/RB posed/VBD for/IN a/DT photo/NN for/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN ./.
The/DT Summer/NNP sun/NN streaming/VBG through/IN the/DT window/NN and/CC we/PRP sat/JJ ,/, chatted/VBN and/CC people-watched/JJ as/IN locals/NNS and/CC visitors/NNS aliked/VBN passed/NN by/IN on/IN Boul/NNP ./.
Saint-Laurent/JJ ./.
So/IN the/DT entire/JJ experience/NN was/VBD romantic/JJ and/CC magical/JJ ,/, a/DT lot/NN like/IN Montreal/NNP really/NNP ;/: )/NNP So/NNP this/DT is/VBZ now/RB my/JJ fave/NN poutine/NN place/NN in/IN Mtl/NNP ./.
Bon/NNP Appetite/NNP !/.
Petit/NNP comptoir/NN au/NN coin/NN Rachel/NNP et/NNP Saint/NNP Laurent/NNP où/NNP la/NNP frite/JJ est/NN reine/NN ./.
Poutine/NNP de/NNP qualité/NNP ,/, frites/VBZ de/IN qualité/NN ./.
Pas/NNP cher/NN pour/NN ce/NN que/JJ l'on/NN mange/NN ./.
Il/NNP est/VBD même/NN possible/JJ de/IN commander/NN par/NN téléphone/NN pour/JJ emporter/NN donc/NN assez/NN pratique/NN ./.
Attention/NNP il/NNP n'y/VBD a/DT pas/NN beaucoup/NN de/IN place/NN cependant/NN !/.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB nice/JJ vegetable/JJ poutine/NN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS are/VBP soft/RB and/CC well/RB seasoned/VBN ./.
The/DT vegetables/NNS are/VBP just/RB a/DT bit/JJ raw/NN for/IN my/PRP$ liking/NN on/IN a/DT hot/NN dish/NN ./.
The/DT gravy/NN is/VBZ smooth/NN and/CC fresh/JJ tasting/VBG (/NNS not/RB chalky/NN like/IN some/DT junky/JJ poutine/NN ./. )/''
The/DT cheese/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ ./.
Overall/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT good/JJ poutine/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD fun/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
They/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN a/DT nice/JJ shop/NN going/VBG in/IN this/DT small/JJ corner/NN of/IN Rachel/NNP and/CC St./NNP Laurent/NNP ./.
I/PRP heard/VBD that/IN the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD awesome/JJ ,/, and/CC reading/NN from/IN previous/JJ reviews/NNS that/IN the/DT poutine/NN was/VBD a/DT MUST/NNP !/.
You/PRP have/VBP to/TO have/VB great/JJ fries/NNS to/TO have/VB great/JJ poutine/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP !/.
So/RB during/IN my/PRP$ visit/NN to/TO Montreal/NNP ,/, I/PRP kept/VBD bugging/VBG my/NNS husband/NN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO stop/NNS by/IN Patati/NNP Patata/NNP so/IN I/PRP could/MD try/VB their/PRP$ ``/`` classique/NN ''/'' poutine/NN ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN other/JJ reviewers/NNS -/JJ this/DT place/NN is/VBZ really/RB cramped/VBN and/CC not/RB for/IN the/DT claustrophobic/NN ./.
The/DT place/NN seats/NN only/RB 13/CD people/NNS max/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT place/NN where/WRB you/PRP want/VBP to/TO bring/VB your/PRP$ kids/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ definitely/RB more/RBR for/IN take/NN out/NN ./.
You/PRP need/VBP to/TO know/VB exactly/RB what/WP you/PRP want/VBP ,/, otherwise/NN you/PRP 'll/MD have/VB the/DT cashier/NN and/CC cook/NN saying/VBG unpleasant/JJ things/NNS in/IN french/NN under/IN their/PRP$ breath/NN ./.
It/PRP happened/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ friend/NN ,/, when/WRB she/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO know/VB what/WP another/DT customer/NN was/VBD having/VBG ./.
They/PRP just/RB want/VBP you/PRP to/TO give/VB a/DT straight/JJ order/NN ./.
The/DT wait/NN is/VBZ incredibly/RB long/RB with/IN the/DT line/NN out/IN the/DT door/NN so/RB be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO wait/VB at/IN least/JJS 20/CD mins/NNS ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, i/NNP really/NNP enjoyed/VBD the/DT poutine/NN !/.
The/DT thin/JJ cut/NN fries/NNS ,/, meaty/NN gravy/NN ,/, and/CC cheese/NN were/VBD just/RB the/DT right/NN amount/NN to/TO complement/NN one/CD another/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/IN it/PRP when/WRB there/EX 's/VBZ too/RB much/JJ gravy/NN that/WDT is/VBZ makes/VBG the/DT fries/NNS soggy/VBP within/IN the/DT first/JJ minutes/NNS and/CC it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT think/JJ bowl/NN of/IN muck/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT portion/NN seemed/VBD rather/RB small/JJ for/IN the/DT price/NN that/IN I/PRP paid/VBD and/CC in/IN comparison/NN to/TO other/JJ places/NNS that/WDT serve/JJ poutine/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT portion/NN had/VBD been/VBN bigger/JJ I/PRP would/MD have/VB definitely/RB given/VBN it/PRP 4/VBZ stars/NNS ./.
Patati/NNP Patata/NNP ./.
I/PRP luv/VBP their/PRP$ poutines/NNS .../:
Always/NNS topped/VBD by/IN an/DT olive/JJ .../NN My/NNP all/DT time/NN favourite/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ tiny/NN cheese/NN burgers/NNS ./.
Not/RB your/VBD typical/JJ burger/NN bun/NN .../:
It/PRP 's/VBZ actually/RB a/DT Portuguese/NN rollThe/NN place/NN is/VBZ tiny/JJ I/PRP always/RB take/VBP it/PRP too/RB go/VBP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN for/IN many/JJ reasons/NNS ./.
I/PRP work/VBP late/JJ so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ to/TO have/VB something/NN else/RB opened/VBD besides/VBZ a/DT McDonalds/NNPS ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, patati/NNP patata/NN is/VBZ not/RB comparable/JJ to/TO McDs/NNP ./.
They/PRP have/VBP cheap/NN prices/NNS for/IN delicious/JJ food/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC I/PRP love/VBP to/TO watch/VB the/DT speed/VBN they/PRP cook/VBP and/CC serve/JJ at/IN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT show/NN in/IN itself/NN ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP get/VB the/DT roast/NN beef/NN platter/NN and/CC their/PRP$ homemade/NN ice/NN tea/NN ./.
Both/NNS are/VBP always/RB delicious/JJ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP also/RB tried/VBN their/PRP$ delicious/JJ burgers/NNS and/CC French/JJ onion/NN soup/NN ./.
Very/NNP good/NNP ./.
Great/NNP sliders/NNS ,/, fries/NNS ,/, and/CC poutine/NN ./.
This/DT little/JJ greasyspoon/NN lunch/NN counter/NN has/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT tastiest/JJS burgers/NNS in/IN the/DT city/NN ,/, and/CC while/IN they/PRP 're/VBP closer/JJR in/IN size/CD to/TO sliders/NNS ,/, the/DT price/NN is/VBZ perfectly/RB right/JJ whether/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO have/VB one/CD or/CC two/CD ./.
They/PRP also/RB make/VBP great/JJ tofu/NN and/CC fish/JJ burgers/NNS ,/, too/RB ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, no/DT greasyspoon/NN is/VBZ complete/JJ without/IN good/JJ fries/NNS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ julien/NN fries/NNS are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
I/PRP 'd/VBP suggest/JJ trying/VBG your/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN one/CD or/CC two/CD burgers/NNS with/IN the/DT fries/salad/JJ plate/NN ,/, but/CC upgrading/VBG the/DT fries/NNS to/TO a/DT poutine/NN is/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB solid/JJ idea/NN ,/, too/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN other/JJ French/JJ Canadian/JJ classics/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, ranging/VBG from/IN shepherd/NN 's/POS pie/NN to/TO (/VB all/DT day/NN )/NNS greasy/JJ breakfast/NN ,/, that/IN are/VBP all/DT worth/JJ trying/NN ,/, so/RB return/JJ visits/NNS are/VBP highly/RB recommended/VBN if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP really/RB high/JJ quality/NN diner/NN fare/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ challenge/NN is/VBZ that/IN seating/NN is/VBZ very/RB limited/JJ ,/, so/RB you/PRP might/MD want/VB to/TO consider/VB takeout/NN if/IN you/PRP mind/VBP waiting/VBG a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS for/IN a/DT spot/NN ./.
The/DT poutine/NN was/VBD awesome/JJ !/NN !/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB much/JJ to/TO compare/VB it/PRP to/TO since/IN it/PRP was/VBD my/VBN first/JJ time/NN having/NN poutine/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN was/VBD real/JJ chill/NN as/IN well/RB ./.
I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB go/VB here/RB again/RB ./.
Ladies/NNS and/CC Gentlemen/NNP ,/, These/DT guys/NNS here/RB know/VBP how/WRB to/TO make/VB a/DT tofu/NN burger/NN !/VBD !/NNP !/.
My/NNP first/JJ time/NN trying/VBG this/DT place/NN out/NN was/VBD this/DT year/NN (/IN I/PRP know/VBP shame/NN on/IN me/NNS ,/, 8/CD years/NNS before/IN it/PRP happened/VBD )/JJ but/CC when/WRB it/PRP did/VBD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD nothing/VBN but/CC love/JJ love/NN love/NN for/IN the/DT place/NN ./.
So/RB why/RB is/VBZ the/DT tofu/NN burger/NN special/NN ?/.
First/NNP Rule/NNP of/IN Tofu/NNP :/: Do/NNP n't/RB make/VB it/PRP try/-NONE- to/TO make/VB it/PRP what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB ./.
They/PRP take/VBP the/DT tofu/NN cook/NN it/PRP up/RB ,/, and/CC they/PRP can/MD add/VB cheese/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, but/CC the/DT beauty/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT hummus/NN with/IN it/PRP ./.
Add/NNP Tomato/NNP and/CC Lettuce/NNP ,/, and/CC Voilà/NNP !/.
Nothing/NN too/RB fussy/JJ ,/, too/RB way/RB out/IN there/RB ./.
Poutine/NN :/: I/PRP did/VBD find/VB the/DT gravy/NN a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT salty/NN side/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP love/VBP the/DT skinny/NN ,/, well-done/JJ fries/NNS and/CC the/DT curd/NN to/TO potato/NN ratio/NN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ right/RB ,/, no/DT soggy/NN french/NN fries/NNS from/IN this/DT joint/NN ./.
Salad/NNP :/: A/DT tossed/VBN green/NN salad/NN ,/, with/IN options/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ homemade/NN dressing/NN ./.
One/CD is/VBZ creamy/NN other/JJ is/VBZ oil/NN vinegar/NN based/VBN ./.
As/IN the/DT waiter/NN said/VBD ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ you/PRP feel/VBP like/IN you/PRP did/VBD n't/RB make/VB the/DT most/RBS unhealthy/JJ choice/NN ever/RB !/.
Atmosphere/RB :/: Tiny/NNP !/.
I/PRP try/VBP to/TO come/VB here/RB in/IN non-peak/JJ hours/NNS ,/, because/IN when/WRB its/PRP$ busy/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ freaking/VBG busy/NN BUT/NNP .../: the/DT staff/NN is/VBZ super/NN nice/NN ,/, friendly/RB and/CC accommodating/VBG and/CC surprisingly/RB they/PRP seem/VBP quite/JJ relaxed/VBN when/WRB running/VBG the/DT show/NN !/.
Definitely/RB come/VBP back/RB when/WRB I/PRP need/VBP a/DT tofu/NN burger/NN !/.
Also/RB hoping/VBG to/TO try/VB other/JJ stuff/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN !/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB visit/VB Montreal/NNP often/RB enough/RB to/TO say/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS poutine/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT poutine/NN purist/NN ;/: I/PRP 'll/MD take/VB the/DT classic/JJ fries/NNS ,/, curds/NNS ,/, and/CC sauce/NN over/IN your/PRP$ fancy/NN concoctions/NNS ./.
So/RB just/RB bear/JJ that/IN in/IN mind/NN as/IN I/PRP say/VBP that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP ecstatic/JJ over/IN their/PRP$ poutine/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT standard/JJ poutine/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ made/VBN with/IN a/DT chicken-based/JJ sauce/NN over/IN a/DT generous/JJ pile/NN of/IN fresh/JJ cheese/NN curds/NNS ,/, and/CC underneath/NN that/IN fries/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN first/JJ blanched/JJ in/IN lower-temperature/NN oil/NN and/CC then/RB finished/VBD a/DT la/NN minute/NN at/IN 375/CD ,/, making/VBG for/IN a/DT crispy/NN fry/NN with/IN a/DT fluffy/JJ interior/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT thinner-than-normal/JJ fry/NN for/IN poutine/NN (/NN if/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO guess/NNS I/PRP 'd/MD say/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ 3/8/CD inch/NN )/NN ,/, but/CC somehow/VB it/PRP works/VBZ for/IN me/PRP to/TO get/VB the/DT textures/NNS and/CC flavors/NNS just/RB right/VBP for/IN poutine/NN ./.
The/DT room/NN is/VBZ tiny/NN ;/: there/EX is/VBZ maybe/NN space/NN for/IN 15-18/JJ at/IN the/DT bar/NN ,/, counters/NNS ,/, and/CC tables/NNS all/DT told/NN ./.
For/IN me/PRP it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT mark/NN of/IN a/DT joint/NN that/WDT does/VBZ one/CD thing/NN very/RB well/RB ,/, without/IN any/DT wish/JJ to/TO dilute/VB that/IN ./.
I/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT perfectly/RB serviceable/JJ slider/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ sliders/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ./.
Delicious/JJ poutine/NN made/VBD in/IN a/DT frying/JJ pan/NN with/IN tones/NNS of/IN vegetables/NNS from/IN onions/NNS ,/, peppers/NNS ,/, to/TO mushrooms/NNS and/CC olives/NNS ./.
Vegetarian/JJ but/CC you/PRP might/MD have/VB to/TO get/VB this/DT one/CD to/TO go/CD since/IN the/DT seating/NN here/RB is/VBZ limited/VBN ./.
Any/NNP dumb/VBD schmo/NN can/MD eat/VB well/RB for/IN lots/NNS of/IN moolah/NN ./.
It/PRP takes/VBZ a/DT savvy/JJ Yelper/NN to/TO eat/VB fantastic/JJ food/NN for/IN pennies/NNS ./.
This/DT may/MD be/VB the/DT most/RBS delicious/JJ and/CC cheapest/NN meal/NN I/PRP had/VBD in/IN Montreal/NNP (/NNP or/CC anywhere/RB else/RB for/IN that/DT matter/NN )/NN ./.
I/PRP love/VBP fried/VBN potatoes/NNS of/IN any/DT kind/NN but/CC the/DT whole/JJ poutine/NN thing/NN kinda/NN jeebed/VBD me/PRP out/IN ./.
Gravy/NNP and/CC cheese/NN curds/NNS on/IN frites/NNS seemed/VBD like/IN guilding/VBG the/DT proverbial/JJ lily/NN ./.
But/CC when/WRB in/IN Montreal/NNP ,/, eat/NN like/IN Montrealers/NNP ,/, so/RB poutine/NN was/VBD tried/VBN and/CC thanks/VBZ to/TO my/PRP$ Yelp/NN research/NN we/PRP found/VBD this/DT place/NN ./.
Such/JJ great/JJ food/NN ,/, such/JJ nice/JJ people/NNS (/VBP staff/NN and/CC customers/NNS alike/VBP )/NN ,/, such/JJ reasonable/JJ prices/NNS ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT sole/JJ which/NN was/VBD lightly/RB and/CC deliciously/RB breaded/VBD ,/, with/IN a/DT salad/JJ and/CC a/DT side/NN of/IN poutine/NN ,/, plus/VBZ the/DT local/JJ Boreal/NNP blonde/NN beer/NN ./.
We/PRP enjoyed/VBD it/PRP sitting/VBG by/IN an/DT open/JJ window/NN with/IN the/DT view/NN of/IN a/DT small/JJ park/NN and/CC the/DT passers/NNS by/IN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT cute/JJ little/JJ place/NN with/IN decent/NN prices/NNS ./.

That/DT included/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT staff/NN but/CC I/PRP digress/VBP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT hamburger/NN and/CC poutine/NN and/CC my/PRP$ sister/NN opted/VBD for/IN a/DT poutine/NN with/IN veggies/NNS ./.
Everything/NN was/VBD great/JJ except/NN that/WDT maybe/NN they/PRP forgot/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT veggie/NN poutine/NN until/IN the/DT very/RB end/JJ or/CC they/PRP just/RB did/VBD not/RB ask/VB ./.
The/DT cook/NN threw/RB all/PDT the/DT veggies/NNS on/IN the/DT poutine/NN raw/NN (/NN mushrooms/NNS ,/, peppers/NNS ,/, onions/NNS )/IN which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD odd/JJ ./.

No/DT big/JJ deal/NN but/CC that/DT is/VBZ the/DT difference/NN between/IN a/DT 4/NN and/CC 5/NN star/NN rating/NN I/PRP guess/NN ./.
Very/NNP tiny/NN old-school/NN diner/NN type/NN ./.

I/PRP get/VBP so/RB happy/JJ thinking/NN about/IN the/DT Poutine/NNP I/PRP had/VBD here/RB last/JJ weekend/NN that/IN I/PRP cry/VBP ./.

Such/NN is/VBZ life/NN .../:

The/DT place/NN was/VBD small/JJ but/CC everyone/NN in/IN there/NNP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB happy/JJ and/CC enjoying/VBG their/PRP$ meals/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT decor/NN was/VBD colorful/JJ and/CC inviting/VBG ./.
After/IN sitting/VBG down/IN I/PRP ordered/VBP a/DT burger/NN and/CC a/DT Poutine/NNP (/NNP Patati/NNP )/NNP ,/, which/WDT came/VBD with/IN the/DT mushrooms/NNS and/CC bell/NN peppers/NNS (/VBP everyone/NN else/RB ordered/JJ ,/, actually/RB ,/, the/DT same/JJ thing/NN :/: P/NNP )/NNP ./.

Now/RB for/IN the/DT Poutine/NNP ./.
Let/NNP me/VBD describe/VB it/PRP a-la/JJ Ham/NNP from/IN the/DT movie/NN The/DT Sandlot/NNP ./.
First/NNP ,/, you/PRP put/VBD the/DT fries/NNS ./.

The/DT flavors/NNS blend/NN so/RB well/RB together/IN !/.
The/DT savory/NN of/IN the/DT gravy/NN with/IN the/DT sweetness/NN and/CC freshness/NN of/IN the/DT onions/NNS and/CC peppers/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT fried/VBN goodness/NN from/IN the/DT potatoes/NNS ,/, topped/VBD off/RP with/IN the/DT mild/NN soothing/VBG nature/NN of/IN the/DT cheese/NN ,/, it/PRP equals/VBZ an/DT explosion/NN of/IN flavors/NNS that/WDT satisfies/NNS with/IN every/DT bite/NN ./.
5/DT stars/NNS for/IN a/DT cute/JJ atmosphere/NN ,/, super/NN nice/NN staff/NN ,/, and/CC great/JJ Poutine/NN Revisit/NN ?/.
Next/NNP time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN Montreal/NNP !/.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT Montreal/NNP gem/NN Tiny/NNP place/NNP ,/, 2/CD overwhelmed/VBN staff/NN ,/, small/JJ menu/NN ./.
One/CD kind/NN of/IN beer/NN ./.
The/DT servings/NNS of/IN burgers/NNS and/CC fries/NNS are/VBP remarkably/RB reasonable/JJ and/CC you/PRP could/MD even/RB say/VB health/NN conscious/NN ./.
Very/NNP small/JJ burgers/NNS and/CC the/DT fries/NNS are/VBP accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT salad/JJ ./.
Its/PRP$ not/RB that/IN bad/JJ if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB ./.
I/PRP really/RB love/VB their/PRP$ hot/NN dog/NN I/PRP have/VBP waiting/VBG a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN here/RB but/CC when/WRB you/PRP see/VBP those/DT people/NNS working/VBP their/PRP$ asses/NNS off/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB ./.

You/PRP will/MD get/VB pretty/RB cramped/VBN otherwise/NN and/CC its/PRP$ a/DT bad/JJ experienced/NN to/TO be/VB crushed/VBN in/IN line/NN ./.
Again/NNP I/PRP love/VBP this/DT place/NN its/PRP$ got/NN everything/NN going/VBG for/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ here/RB !/VBN !/NN !/.
I/PRP went/VBD there/RB at/IN night/NN because/IN Ive/NNP seen/IN the/DT huge/JJ line/NN ups/NNS to/TO this/DT place/NN during/IN supper/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ and/CC seeing/JJ thee/NN amount/NN of/IN take/JJ outs/NNS these/DT guys/NNS get/VBP I/PRP knew/VBD I/PRP was/VBD in/IN for/IN something/NN great/JJ while/IN seated/VBN in/IN the/DT small/JJ corner/NN ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ great/JJ for/IN students/NNS and/CC it/PRP also/RB advertises/VBZ many/JJ local/JJ events/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurants/NNS ,/, in/IN case/NN you/PRP 're/VBP someone/JJ looking/NN around/IN for/IN whats/NNS going/VBG on/IN in/IN town.The/NN service/NN is/VBZ very/RB private/JJ and/CC very/RB very/RB NOT/JJ intimidating/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ only/RB two/CD people/NNS serving/VBG anyway/NN (/IN one/CD cooking/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ serving/VBG )/NNS so/IN it/PRP felt/VBD really/RB nice/JJ to/TO be/VB chatting/VBG it/PRP up/RB with/IN them/PRP too/RB without/IN feeling/VBG like/IN someones/NNS just/RB trying/VBG to/TO be/VB nice/JJ for/IN you/PRP know/VBP what/WP ../NN ./.
ANYWAY/IN all/DT I/PRP 'm/VBP saying/VBG is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP always/RB go/VBP at/IN night/NN in/IN this/DT place/NN (/RB well/RB the/DT two/CD times/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB so/IN far/RB )/NN and/CC the/DT food/NN AND/NNP service/NN was/VBD great/JJ even/RB just/RB before/IN closing/NNS ,/, not/RB what/WP you/PRP can/MD say/VB about/IN most/JJS places/NNS ./.
My/NNP poutine/NN with/IN ground/NN beef/NN was/VBD really/RB really/RB good/JJ ./.
I/PRP highly/RB recommend/VBP it/PRP ./.
../NN wow/NN that/WDT was/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN ``/`` ands/NNS ''/'' I/PRP want/VBP to/TO keep/VB on/IN adding/VBG ands/NNS but/CC those/DT you/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB and/CC check/NN it../NN

GAHHH/NNP AND/NNP did/VBD i/JJ say/NN about/IN the/DT cool/NN prices/NNS to/TO this/DT place/NN ?/.
Patati/NNP and/CC Patata/NNP is/VBZ in/IN a/DT prime/JJ location/NN on/IN the/DT corner/NN of/IN st/NN Laurent/NNP and/CC Rachel/NNP ./.
The/DT poutine/NN has/VBZ a/DT homemade/NN sauce/NN that/WDT has/VBZ a/DT sweet/NN like/IN aftertaste/NN ./.
The/DT fresh/JJ cut/NN French/JJ fries/NNS are/VBP fried/VBN not/RB too/RB crispy/JJ but/CC not/RB too/RB soft/RB ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, PERFECTION/NNP ./.
With/IN a/DT generous/JJ amount/NN of/IN cheese/NN curds/NNS ,/, to/TO satisfy/VB any/DT cheese/NN lover/NN ./.
An/DT important/JJ tip/NN is/VBZ to/TO always/RB get/VB a/DT salad/NN with/IN the/DT poutine/NN ,/, (/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ almost/RB the/DT same/JJ price/NN )/NNS ./.
The/DT salads/NNS have/VBP a/DT nice/JJ variety/NN of/IN greens/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ a/DT colorful/JJ salad/NN ,/, orange/NN and/CC yellow/JJ peppers/NNS ,/, onions/NNS ,/, olives/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT crispy/NN leafy/NN lettuce/NN chopped/VBD to/TO bite/JJ size/NN ./.
The/DT salad/JJ also/RB comes/VBZ With/IN the/DT choice/NN 4/RB different/JJ house/NN dressing/NN ,/, my/NNP favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT balsamic/NN ./.
The/DT fish/JJ filet/NN is/VBZ made/VBN to/TO order/NN ,/, they/PRP cook/VBP everything/VBG right/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN you/PRP ,/, on/IN a/DT nice/JJ fluffy/NN roll/NN ./.
The/DT filet/NN of/IN sole/JJ tasted/VBN fresh/JJ ,/, moist/NN and/CC succulent/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ something/NN to/TO be/VB said/VBN about/IN a/DT fish/JJ being/VBG prepared/VBN in/IN front/NN of/IN you/PRP also/RB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ package/VBN conveniently/RB for/IN people/NNS on/IN the/DT go/NN like/IN myself/NN ./.
Best/NNP burger/NN sliders/NNS and/CC poutine/NN ever/RB !/.
Ambiance/NNP is/VBZ really/RB nice/JJ and/CC cozy/JJ ./.
Staff/NNP is/VBZ super/NN friendly/RB ./.
Price/value/NNP here/RB is/VBZ unmatched/JJ anywhere/RB ./.
Love/NNP this/DT place/NN !/.
Flying/VBG in/IN from/IN Southern/NNP California/NNP and/CC arriving/VBG late/NN in/IN Montreal/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT perfect/NN place/NN to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ poutine/NN fix/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ open/JJ late/JJ ,/, they/PRP serve/VBP beer/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT types/NNS of/IN poutine/NN are/VBP abundant/JJ ./.
If/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ crowded/VBN ,/, order/NN to/TO go/VB and/CC chill/NN at/IN the/DT park/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
I/PRP visited/VBD Montreal/NNP for/IN a/DT bachelor/NN party/NN and/CC my/PRP$ mission/NN was/VBD two-fold/JJ :/: strippers/NNS and/CC poutine/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD poutine/NN from/IN the/DT dingy/JJ places/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT streets/NNS and/CC from/IN the/DT fancy/NN restaurants/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ fancy/NN steaks/NNS ./.
Patati/NNP Patata/NNP stands/NNP above/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.
Simple/NNP recipe/NN ,/, friendly/RB service/NN ,/, bumping/JJ atmosphere/RB and/CC delicious/JJ poutine/NN ./.
What/WP more/RBR can/MD you/VB ask/NN for/IN ?/.
Sure/NNP it/PRP may/MD be/VB standing/VBG room/NN only/RB and/CC the/DT line/NN is/VBZ out/IN there/RB door/NN ,/, but/CC these/DT are/VBP n't/RB necessarily/RB bad/JJ things/NNS ./.
PS/NNP ./.
who/WP knew/NN there/NNS were/VBD such/JJ thigns/NNS as/IN a/DT ``/`` poutinery/NN ''/''
I/PRP came/VBD here/RB in/IN Summer/NNP 2013/CD (/NN twice/NN )/NN and/CC I/PRP loved/VBD it/PRP !/.
Their/PRP$ prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ and/CC I/PRP ordered/VBP take/JJ out/RP twice/NN because/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB to/TO wait/NN for/IN a/DT table/JJ ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ very/RB small/JJ and/CC can/MD only/RB seat/VB up/RP to/TO around/IN 15/CD people/NNS I/PRP believe/VBP ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP very/RB cheap/JJ (/IN I/PRP believe/VBP around/IN two/CD bucks/NNS )/IN so/RB ordering/JJ two/CD will/MD fill/VB you/PRP up/IN easily/NN ./.
Their/NNP fish/JJ burger/NN is/VBZ also/RB very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC their/PRP$ poutine/NN is/VBZ decent/JJ ./.
The/DT walk/NN from/IN central/JJ Montreal/NNP is/VBZ perhaps/RB 15-25/JJ minutes/NNS so/IN I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP since/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN to/TO see/VB on/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO this/DT restaurant/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ actually/RB pretty/RB hard/JJ to/TO spot/NN because/IN the/DT name/NN is/VBZ kind/NN of/IN hidden/JJ so/IN you/PRP might/MD want/VB to/TO look/VB it/PRP up/IN on/IN google/NN images/NNS to/TO prepare/JJ yourself/NN ./.
(/NN or/CC just/RB use/JJ GPS/NN on/IN your/PRP$ phone/NN if/IN you/PRP have/VBP data/VBN )/JJ Patati/NNP Patata/NNP is/VBZ the/DT epitome/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN ``/`` cheap/NN eats/NNS ''/'' and/CC definitely/RB should/MD be/VB visited/VBN by/IN anybody/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB people/NNS on/IN a/DT budget/NN !/.
Small/JJ place/NN ,/, really/RB simple/JJ food/NN but/CC done/NN very/RB well/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD the/DT poutine/NN with/IN mushrooms/NNS ,/, peppers/NNS and/CC onions/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
The/DT fries/NNS are/VBP thin/JJ and/CC crispy/NN and/CC sort/NN of/IN tasted/VBN a/DT bit/NN like/IN sweet/JJ potato/NN fries/NNS but/CC they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB ,/, so/RB that/IN was/VBD odd/JJ but/CC still/RB very/RB tasty/JJ ./.
We/PRP also/RB had/VBD the/DT cheeseburger/NN ./.
Great/JJ price/NN for/IN a/DT pretty/RB tasty/JJ burger/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT little/JJ small/JJ but/CC still/RB worth/JJ it/PRP for/IN what/WP you/PRP get/VBP ./.
Tiny/NNP place/NN with/IN cool/NN atmosphere/RB and/CC a/DT great/JJ serving/VBG staff/NN ./.
The/DT patatine/NN was/VBD nice/JJ but/CC not/RB as/RB amazing/JJ as/IN I/PRP 'd/VBP hoped/VBN ./.
The/DT grilled/VBD cheese/NN sandwich/NN and/CC fish/JJ sandwich/NN were/VBD both/DT very/RB good/JJ and/CC we/PRP 'll/MD costed/VBN though/IN ./.
So/RB definitely/RB a/DT recommended/JJ place/NN ./.
Self-proclaimed/JJ poutine-obsessed/JJ girl/NN checking/NN in/IN ./.
On/IN my/PRP$ latest/JJS visit/NN to/TO Montreal/NNP my/NNP friend/NN had/VBD the/DT challenge/NN of/IN bringing/JJ me/VBG the/DT best/JJS poutine/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD in/IN town/NN for/IN three/CD days/NNS and/CC was/VBD getting/JJ nervous/JJ when/WRB our/JJ schedules/NNS did/VBD n't/RB match/VB up/RP on/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD days/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT stars/NNS aligned/VBD on/IN day/NN three/CD and/CC I/PRP ended/VBD up/RP with/IN warm/NN take-out/NN poutine/NN from/IN Patati/NNP Patata/NNP in/IN my/PRP$ hands/NN ./.
While/IN this/DT was/VBD actually/RB my/JJ friend/NN 's/POS second/JJ favorite/JJ poutine/NN place/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB it/PRP over/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.
He/PRP ordered/VBD me/PRP one/CD with/IN peppers/NNS ,/, onions/NNS ,/, and/CC shaved/VBD beef/NN ./.
I/PRP usually/VBP opt/JJ for/IN the/DT traditional/JJ but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP glad/JJ he/PRP forced/VBD me/PRP to/TO go/VB beyond/NN that/IN ./.
The/DT fries/NNS were/VBD crunchy/JJ on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, but/CC gave/VBD way/NN to/TO the/DT gravy/NN and/CC became/VBD softer/NN ./.
This/DT may/MD sound/VB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP like/VBP when/WRB the/DT fries/NNS can/MD absorb/VB the/DT gravy/NN without/IN becoming/NN mushy/NN ./.
The/DT cheese/NN curds/NNS were/VBD the/DT perfect/JJ temperature/NN even/RB after/IN traveling/NN ./.
The/DT outside/NN of/IN each/DT nugget/NN was/VBD just/RB starting/VBN to/TO become/VB warm/NN and/CC gooey/NN while/IN the/DT inside/NN left/VBD a/DT cooler/NN ,/, squeakier/JJR end/NN to/TO the/DT bite/NN ./.
All/DT of/IN the/DT toppings/NNS worked/VBD together/RB ./.
I/PRP especially/VBP enjoyed/VBN the/DT fresh/NN and/CC colorful/JJ peppers/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP so/RB used/VBN to/TO poutine/VB being/VBG different/JJ versions/NNS of/IN brown/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT red/VBN and/CC yellow/JJ peppers/NNS made/VBD the/DT visual/JJ experience/NN of/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN quite/RB pleasurable/JJ ./.
I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB anything/NN to/TO the/DT interior/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ,/, service/NN ,/, or/CC really/RB anything/NN besides/VBZ this/DT one/CD dish/NN ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ poutine/NN senses/NNS were/VBD thrilled/VBN and/CC I/PRP could/MD go/VB back/RB to/TO the/DT states/NNS a/DT happy/NN girl/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ my/RB first/JJ poutine/NN from/IN a/DT regular/JJ cafe/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ poutine/NN I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD from/IN Garde/NNP Manger/NNP (/NNP read/NNP my/NNP other/JJ review/NN !/NNS )/.
so/IN I/PRP might/MD be/VB ruined/VBN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD still/RB pretty/RB good/JJ poutine/NN ./.
I/PRP also/RB got/VBD the/DT fish/JJ burger/NN ./.
What/NN was/VBD most/RBS impressive/JJ was/VBD the/DT dynamic/JJ duo/NN that/WDT runs/VBZ the/DT place/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP very/RB busy/JJ ,/, they/PRP work/VBP in/IN a/DT tight/JJ space/NN ,/, and/CC are/VBP still/RB extremely/RB cheerful/JJ and/CC friendly/RB !/.
The/DT national/JJ junk/NN food/NN dish/NN of/IN Canada/NNP is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB poutine/NN ,/, the/DT love/JJ child/NN of/IN gravy/NN and/CC cheese/NN kurds/NNS and/CC a/DT potato/NN concoction/NN worthy/NN of/IN countless/NN heart/NN attacks/NNS ./.
After/IN many/JJ encounters/NNS of/IN this/DT nearly/NN banned/VBD food/NN (/NN #/VBD 1/CD )/CD ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP willing/JJ to/TO admit/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS versions/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB had/VBD was/VBD here/RB at/IN Patati/NNP Patata/NNP ./.
This/DT greasy/NN spoon/NN has/VBZ a/DT stellar/JJ reputation/NN for/IN serving/VBG Montreal/NNP some/DT of/IN the/DT very/RB best/JJ in/IN comfort/NN fare/NN for/IN little/JJ money/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN insanely/RB crowded/VBN here/RB almost/RB every/DT time/NN I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN here/RB and/CC is/VBZ not/RB a/DT place/NN for/IN anyone/NN who/WP is/VBZ remotely/RB claustrophobic/JJ ./.
A/DT 15/NN person/NN occupancy/NN might/MD be/VB too/RB generous/JJ of/IN a/DT number/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ pretty/RB tight/JJ in/IN here/RB regardless/JJ ./.
There/EX is/VBZ barely/RB enough/RB for/IN 4/NN on/IN their/PRP$ counter/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN some/DT folks/NNS literally/RB just/RB stand/JJ and/CC eat/JJ their/PRP$ food/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN fortunate/JJ enough/JJ to/TO score/VB a/DT seat/NN each/DT time/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD n't/RB without/JJ having/NN to/TO wait/VB at/IN least/JJS 20/CD minutes/NNS ./.
Their/PRP$ burgers/NNS are/VBP good/JJ ,/, juicy/NN and/CC flavorful/JJ in/IN every/DT bite/NN ./.
Also/RB good/JJ are/VBP their/PRP$ daily/JJ soups/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN my/PRP$ recent/JJ case/NN was/VBD a/DT red/VBN beet/NN borscht/NN -/JJ totally/RB worth/IN all/DT $/$ 2/CD of/IN my/PRP$ money/NN ./.
What/WP most/RBS folks/VBZ come/NN for/IN is/VBZ what/WP everyone/NN should/MD try/VB ,/, their/PRP$ amazing/JJ poutine/NN ./.
Cheese/NNP kurds/VBZ sprinkled/VBN over/IN a/DT bed/JJ of/IN gravy/NN soaked/VBD fries/NNS ,/, makes/VBZ for/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN artery/NN clogging/VBG ``/`` salad/JJ ''/'' that/IN looks/VBZ more/JJR like/IN a/DT stew/NN of/IN potatoes/NNS ./.
Every/NNP bite/NN was/VBD savory/JJ ,/, the/DT gravy/NN was/VBD delightful/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT cheese/NN kurds/NNS were/VBD not/RB in/IN the/DT least/JJS bit/NN heavy/NN ./.
Best/NN of/IN all/DT ,/, it/PRP cost/VBD me/PRP only/RB $/$ 4.00/CD for/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN poutine/NN goodness/NN ./.
Like/IN only/RB the/DT finest/JJS of/IN Montreal/NNP businesses/NNS ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP open/JJ fairly/NN late/NN ./.

Such/IN a/DT small/JJ place/NN but/CC such/JJ big/JJ flavor/NN ./.
The/DT service/NN was/VBD prompt/JJ ,/, the/DT hamburger/NN was/VBD fresh/JJ not/RB frozen/VBN ,/, the/DT fries/NNS crispy/NN just/RB the/DT way/NN I/PRP like/IN them/PRP and/CC the/DT salad/JJ well/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT salad/JJ I/NN was/VBD there/RB for/IN the/DT poutine/NN ./.
The/DT gravy/NN was/VBD extremely/RB tasty/JJ and/CC the/DT cheese/NN was/VBD just/RB enough/RB without/IN it/PRP over/IN riding/VBG the/DT dish/JJ ./.
Good/NNP times/NNP ,/, good/JJ food/NN and/CC super/NN service/NN ./.
We/PRP will/MD be/VB back/RB ./.
The/DT poutine/NN here/RB was/VBD ultimately/RB delicious/JJ :/: really/RB beefy/JJ gravy/NN ,/, really/RB fresh/JJ (/NN and/CC delightfully/RB squeaky/JJ )/NN cheese/NN curd/NN ,/, REALLY/NNP crispy/NN fries/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD probably/RB too/RB amused/VBN that/IN my/PRP$ 32-oz/JJ serving/NN of/IN beer/NN came/VBD in/IN an/DT adorable/JJ demi/NN pitcher/NN that/WDT belongs/NNS in/IN a/DT dollhouse/NN ./.
Not/RB bad/JJ ./.
Good/NNP value/NN for/IN money/NN ,/, but/CC would/MD n't/RB be/VB running/VBN back/RB ./.
We/PRP tried/VBD a/DT burger/NN ,/, a/DT fish/JJ burger/NN and/CC a/DT tofu/NN burger/NN ./.
Tofu/NNP burger/NN was/VBD an/DT interesting/JJ concept/NN but/CC didnt/VB thrill/JJ me/NNS ./.
The/DT best/NN was/VBD the/DT fish/JJ burger/NN ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ small/JJ but/CC good/JJ ./.
All/IN the/DT staff/NN were/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC price/NN was/VBD reasonable/JJ ./.
I/PRP just/RB ordered/VBD one/CD classic/JJ poutine/NN to/TO go/VB ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD made/VBN freshly/JJ and/CC gravy/NN was/VBD hot/NN enough/RB to/TO melt/VB the/DT cheese/NN curd/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ salty/NN for/IN me/PRP ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP was/VBD not/RB my/JJ dish/NN ./.
I/PRP preferred/VBD some/DT kind/NN of/IN creative-style/NN poutine~/NN I/PRP found/VBD that/IN many/JJ customers/NNS chosen/VBN their/PRP$ burger/NN ./.
It/PRP looks/VBZ good/JJ too/NN ./.

The/DT poutine/NN looked/VBD beautiful/JJ and/CC was/VBD prepared/VBN very/RB well/RB though/IN ./.
The/DT burger/NN patties/NNS they/PRP pack/VBP are/VBP small/JJ and/CC reminiscent/NN of/IN a/DT McDonald/NNP 's/POS burger/NN in/IN size/NN and/CC shape/NN (/NN thickness/NN )/NN but/CC were/VBD seasoned/VBN well/RB ,/, of/IN good/JJ quality/NN meat/NN and/CC cooked/VBD perfectly/RB also/RB ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB had/VBD a/DT burger/NN this/DT way/NN (/NN and/CC after/IN all/DT ,/, its/PRP$ just/RB a/DT hamburger/NN )/NN but/CC I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN and/CC rather/RB delighted/VBN nonetheless/JJ ./.
They/PRP give/VBP you/PRP a/DT list/NN of/IN toppings/NNS that/IN you/PRP check/VBP off/RP on/IN like/IN an/DT order/NN sheet/NN which/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB handy/JJ ./.

Definitely/RB a/DT fun/JJ ,/, quick/JJ stop/NN when/WRB navigating/VBG around/IN this/DT beautiful/JJ city/NN ./.
The/DT poutine/NN is/VBZ delicious/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT staff/NN really/RB made/VBD it/PRP for/IN us/PRP ./.
We/PRP were/VBD five/CD tourists/NNS ,/, very/RB unsure/JJ of/IN what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO order/NN ,/, and/CC taking/VBD up/RP a/DT lot/NN of/IN space/NN in/IN this/DT small/JJ diner/NN ./.
Instead/NN of/IN being/VBG impatient/JJ with/IN us/PRP ,/, the/DT waiters/NNS found/VBD us/PRP five/CD seats/NNS together/RB and/CC talked/VBD us/PRP through/IN all/PDT the/DT menu/NN ./.
We/PRP just/RB loved/VBD it/PRP here/RB ./.
If/IN a/DT friend/NN is/VBZ visiting/VBG from/IN out/IN of/IN province/NN ,/, take/VB them/PRP here/RB to/TO show/VB them/PRP real/JJ Québécois/NN poutine/NN ./.
Rather/RB than/IN just/RB a/DT pile/NN of/IN fries/NNS ,/, gravy/NN and/CC cheese/NN curds/NNS ,/, the/DT poutine/NN is/VBZ balanced/VBN and/CC is/VBZ treated/VBN like/IN a/DT real/JJ dish/NN ,/, not/RB as/IN just/RB an/DT after-drinks/JJ carb/NN ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ artsy/NN and/CC local/JJ music/JJ festivals/NNS are/VBP always/RB on/IN the/DT walls/NNS ./.
The/DT space/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ small/JJ though/NN ,/, but/CC nearby/JJ parks/NNS make/VBP it/PRP great/-NONE- for/IN take/NN out/RP picnics/NNS if/IN the/DT weather/NN permits/NNS ./.
Pricing/NNP is/VBZ also/RB perfect/NN for/IN the/DT high/JJ quality/NN of/IN poutine/NN you/PRP get/VB ./.
After/IN our/PRP$ friends/NNS showed/VBD us/PRP this/DT little/NN spot/NN we/PRP could/MD n't/RB get/VB enough/RB !/.
Ate/NNP here/RB 3/CD days/NNS in/IN a/DT row/NN because/IN their/PRP$ burgers/NNS were/VBD THAT/RB good/JJ ./.
$/$ 3/CD for/IN a/DT delicious/JJ burger/NN ,/, you/PRP really/RB ca/VBP n't/RB beat/VB it/PRP !/.
Their/NNP iced/VBD tea/NN is/VBZ a/DT must/NN try/NN as/IN well/RB and/CC only/RB $/$ 1.75/CD !/CD !/.
Tried/NNP their/VBD poutine/NN for/IN lunch/NN one/CD day/NN and/CC to/TO be/VB honest/VBN i/NN 'm/NNS not/RB too/RB fond/RB of/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT cheeses/NNS curds/NNS were/VBD felt/VBN very/RB rubbery/JJ and/CC i/JJ could/MD hear/VB eat/JJ bite/JJ like/IN rubber/NN rain/NN boots/VBZ rubbing/VBG against/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
But/CC I/PRP still/RB highly/RB highly/RB recommend/VB getting/VBG their/PRP$ regular/JJ burger/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD enjoy/VB it/PRP in/IN their/PRP$ store/JJ (/NN if/IN there/EX 's/VBZ room/NN )/NN or/CC at/IN the/DT park/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN !/.

I/PRP took/VBD a/DT burger/NN and/CC a/DT Poutine/NNP ,/, the/DT burger/NN was/VBD alright../RB Poutine/JJ wad/NN good/JJ but/CC not/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN ./.
To/TO be/VB honest/NN I/PRP expected/VBP more/JJR because/IN of/IN the/DT hype/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO eat/VB ,/, I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB recommend/VB to/TO people/NNS if/IN they/PRP are/VBP hungry/JJ ./.
Place/NNP is/VBZ not/RB big/JJ by/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB tight/JJ and/CC it/PRP feels/VBZ like/IN you/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG to/TO everyone/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ damn/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT employees/NNS are/VBP very/RB nice/JJ and/CC they/PRP definitely/RB treat/VBP you/PRP with/IN respect/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD also/RB facing/VBG the/DT chef/NN so/IN I/PRP could/MD see/VB what/WP he/PRP was/VBD doing/VBG which/WDT was/VBD cool/NN ./.

The/DT whole/JJ meal/NN +/VBD a/DT drink/NN was/VBD only/RB $/$ 12/CD CAD/NNP ./.
Would/NNP come/VBD back/RB for/IN the/DT tofu/NN burger/NN another/DT day/NN ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS here/RB are/VBP like/IN little/JJ flavour/NN bombs/NNS !/.
You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB eat/VB just/RB one/CD ./.
The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ a/DT tiny/NN hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN with/IN very/RB limited/JJ seating/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP eat/VB in/IN they/PRP will/MD bring/VB your/PRP$ order/NN to/TO your/PRP$ table/JJ ./.

Ordering/NNP is/VBZ simple/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP get/VBP a/DT burger/NN you/PRP are/VBP handed/VBN a/DT small/JJ paper/NN with/IN the/DT various/JJ toppings/NNS offered/VBD ./.
You/PRP write/VBP down/IN your/PRP$ name/NN and/CC check/NN off/RP what/WP toppings/NNS you/PRP want/VBP and/CC then/RB pay/VB for/IN your/PRP$ order/NN ./.
The/DT wait/NN is/VBZ usually/RB pretty/RB fast/JJ (/NN about/IN 5-10/CD minutes/NNS )/RB considering/VBG they/PRP 're/VBP always/RB very/RB busy/JJ !/.
I/PRP always/VBP eat/JJ at/IN the/DT park/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN since/IN seating/NN is/VBZ tight/JJ and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN gets/VBZ really/RB hot/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT bodies/NNS inside/NN ./.
The/DT poutine/NN was/VBD also/RB good/JJ but/CC a/DT little/JJ too/NN salty/NN ./.
Seriously/RB ,/, the/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP all/DT you/PRP need/VBP to/TO fall/NN in/IN love/JJ with/IN Patati/NNP Patata/NNP ./.

1/CD star/JJ not/RB for/IN the/DT food/NN experience/NN but/CC the/DT service/NN my/NN fiancée/NN and/CC I/PRP received/VBD from/IN the/DT bearded/VBN guy/NN at/IN the/DT register/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB was/VBD n't/RB he/PRP welcoming/VBG (/IN the/DT way/NN he/PRP spoke/VBD to/TO us/PRP had/VBD a/DT vibe/NN of/IN ``/`` do/VBP n't/RB stay/VB here/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP other/JJ people/NNS coming/VBG ''/'' but/CC at/IN the/DT end/NN he/PRP overcharged/VBD me/PRP by/IN almost/RB 10/CD dollars/NNS ,/, I/PRP noticed/VBD the/DT mistake/NN once/RB I/PRP got/VBD out/RP ,/, came/VBD back/RB and/CC confronted/VBD him/PRP ./.
He/PRP acted/VBD as/IN if/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB his/JJ fault/NN but/CC ultimately/RB admitted/VBD to/TO the/DT mistake/NN and/CC I/PRP got/VBD my/JJ money/NN back/RB ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD delicious/JJ but/CC I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB come/VB back/RB because/IN of/IN that/DT prick/NN ./.
The/DT other/JJ two/CD guys/NNS were/VBD super/NN cool/NN ./.

The/DT prices/NNS were/VBD crazy/JJ cheap/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS way/NN cheaper/JJR than/IN what/WP I/PRP 'm/VBP used/JJ to/TO ./.
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP left/VBD about/IN $/$ 15/CD lighter/NN and/CC 5/NN lbs/NNS heavier/NN ,/, I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB complain/VB except/NNS for/IN that/DT amount/NN of/IN time/NN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO spend/NN at/IN the/DT gym/NN to/TO work/VB off/RP those/DT calories/NNS !/.
The/DT staff/NN is/VBZ very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC I/PRP thought/VBP it/PRP was/VBD located/VBN in/IN a/DT pretty/NN cool/NN area/NN ./.
C'est/NNP bien/NN ,/, pas/VBZ plus/RB ./.

Service/NNP was/VBD outstanding/JJ ./.
Great/NNP neighborhood/VBD with/IN people/NNS watching/VBG galore/NN ./.
A/DT must/NN visit/NN ./.
We/PRP came/VBD here/RB on/IN a/DT friends/NNS recommendation/NN to/TO try/VB out/RP the/DT Poutine/NN ./.

We/PRP were/VBD seated/VBN in/IN about/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT patatine/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT vegetarian/JJ poutine/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN burgers/NNS on/IN the/DT side/NN ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP more/JJR like/IN sliders/NNS and/CC really/RB cheap/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
I/PRP ordered/VBP the/DT tofu/NN burger/NN and/CC got/VBD a/DT really/RB filling/JJ piece/NN for/IN under/IN 3/NN $/$ ./.
The/DT poutine/NN itself/NN was/VBD way/RB better/JJR than/IN what/WP I/PRP tried/VBP once/RB in/IN the/DT US/NN so/IN I/PRP was/VBD glad/JJ I/PRP ordered/VBP it/PRP ./.
The/DT crowd/NN was/VBD mostly/RB local/JJ and/CC the/DT menu/NN is/VBZ in/IN French/NNP but/CC everyone/NN speaks/VBZ English/NN and/CC people/NNS were/VBD very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC helpful/JJ ./.
Metered/NNP parking/NN on/IN the/DT street/NN which/WDT is/VBZ as/RB good/JJ as/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ for/IN Montreal/NNP ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN going/VBG to/TO Patati/NNP Patata/NNP for/IN years/NNS and/CC I/PRP never/RB get/VBP sick/JJ of/IN it/PRP !/.
For/IN around/IN 8/CD $/$ you/PRP can/MD eat/VB a/DT satisfying/JJ ,/, tasty/JJ meal/NN in/IN a/DT timely/RB fashion/NN ./.
The/DT atmosphere/NN is/VBZ cosy/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN is/VBZ friendly/RB ./.
Ca/NNP n't/RB say/VB enough/RB good/JJ things/NNS !/.
This/DT place/NN is/VBZ wonderful/JJ ./.
The/DT definition/NN of/IN ``/`` hole-in-the-wall/JJ ,/, ''/'' really/RB ./.
There/EX are/VBP only/RB several/JJ seats/NNS and/CC if/IN you/PRP go/VBP at/IN prime/JJ dinner/NN hours/IN the/DT line/NN is/VBZ out/IN the/DT door/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ worth/IN the/DT wait/NN ./.
The/DT poutine/NN is/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN Montreal/NNP ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ favorite/JJ thing/NN to/TO order/NN here/RB is/VBZ the/DT Mediterranean/NNP Burger/NNP ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ feta/VBN on/IN it/PRP ,/, with/IN a/DT special/JJ tzatziki/mint/NN sauce/NN that/WDT is/VBZ delicious/JJ ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP small/JJ ,/, made/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ ingredients/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT fries/NNS are/VBP perfectly/RB done/RB ./.
Their/NNP salad/VBD dressings/NNS are/VBP homemade/NN and/CC are/VBP also/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT breakfast/NN menu/NN as/IN well/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP never/RB tried/VBN anything/NN off/IN of/IN it/PRP ./.
If/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT definite/JJ spot/NN to/TO hit/VB !/.
Oh/NNP yes/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ cheap/NN -/JJ you/PRP can/MD get/VB a/DT burger/NN ,/, fries/NNS ,/, and/CC salad/VBD for/IN $/$ 6/CD ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP gets/VBZ much/RB better/JJR than/IN that/DT ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT super/NN small/JJ restaurant/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ to/TO take/VB your/JJ food/NN and/CC go/VB across/NN to/TO the/DT street/NN ,/, weather/RB permitting/VBG ./.
The/DT poutine/NN is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ./.
First/NNP poutine/NN in/IN Montreal/NNP ./.
Was/NNP n't/RB too/RB bad/JJ ,/, the/DT service/NN was/VBD great/JJ though/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD just/RB poutine/JJ ,/, fries/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, lots/NNS of/IN cheese/NN ,/, and/CC good/JJ sauce/NN ./.
It/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB perfect/JJ ./.
Great/NNP hole/NN in/IN wall/JJ .../: 1st/CD time/NN i/NN ever/RB had/VBD poutine/NN and/CC was/VBD excellent/JJ !/NN !/.
!/NN
Best/NNP poutine/NN we/PRP had/VBD in/IN Montreal/NNP ./.
Much/NNP better/JJR than/IN another/DT famed/VBN place/NN (/NNS *cough*/-NONE- Resto/NNP La/NNP Banquise/NNP *cough*/NNP )/NNP ./.
Good/NNP gravy/NN ,/, good/JJ fries/NNS ,/, tasty/NN cheese/NN ./.
Our/NNP curds/NNS did/VBD n't/RB squeak/VB ,/, so/RB take/VBP that/IN for/IN what/WP it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ to/TO you/PRP ./.
Tip/NNP :/: get/VB the/DT poutine/NN with/IN the/DT peppers/NNS and/CC mushrooms/NNS ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ only/RB a/DT couple/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT same/JJ price/NN (/VBD $/$ 6/CD something/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ delicious/JJ ./.
If/IN the/DT weather/NN 's/POS nice/NN ,/, go/VB enjoy/JJ it/PRP in/IN the/DT park/NN across/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
Little/NNP cheeseburger/NN slider/NN with/IN salad/JJ and/CC fries/VBZ :/: A/DT ./.
Side/NN of/IN poutine/NN :/: B/NNP ./.
No/DT squeaks/NNS to/TO be/VB had/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT gravy/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/JJ thin/NN ./.
Fries/NNS were/VBD excellent/JJ ./.
Really/RB liked/VBD the/DT quick/JJ ,/, friendly/RB service/NN and/CC the/DT whole/JJ set/NN up/IN ./.
A/DT tiny/NN place/NN ,/, but/CC absolutely/RB brilliant/JJ !/.
Tiny/NNP burgers/NNS made/VBD to/TO order/NN by/IN hand/NN ,/, excellent/JJ poutine/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB borscht/JJ !/.
And/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ cheap/NN !/.
A/DT perfect/NN place/NN for/IN lunch/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD recommended/VBN to/TO me/PRP on/IN a/DT recent/JJ visit/NN to/TO Montreal/NNP by/IN somebody/NN who/WP follows/VBZ me/PRP on/IN Twitter/NNP (/NNP a/DT McGill/NNP alumna/NN )/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT fantastic/JJ call/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB going/VBG back/RB next/IN time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBD up/RP that/DT way/NN !/.
Great/NNP prices/NNS ,/, tasty/NN burgers/NNS ,/, fries/NNS and/CC poutine/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT record/NN ,/, my/NN only/RB other/JJ experience/NN with/IN poutine/NN was/VBD in/IN Toronto/NNP and/CC I/PRP was/VBD totally/RB underwhelmed/JJ ./.
The/DT poutine/NN at/IN this/DT place/NN is/VBZ completely/RB different/JJ and/CC much/JJ better/NN ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP slider/NN size/NN ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP get/VBP a/DT burger/NN with/IN fries/NNS and/CC salad/JJ ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB stuffed/VBN ./.
I/PRP 'll/VBP definitely/RB return/VBN next/IN time/NN I/PRP 'm/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
My/NNP boyfriend/NN and/CC i/NN wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB a/DT new/JJ poutine/NN place/NN so/IN we/PRP stepped/VBD in/IN and/CC ordered/NN ./.
The/DT man/NN asked/VBD us/PRP if/IN we/PRP wanted/VBP to/TO sit/VB down/RP or/CC take/VB out/RP ./.
Since/IN it/PRP was/VBD 11:30pm/CD we/PRP figured/VBD we/PRP 'd/MD probably/RB take/VB some/DT home/NN anyways/NNS ./.
We/PRP asked/VBD to/TO have/VB in/IN a/DT to/TO go/VB box/NN but/CC we/PRP would/MD sit/VB there/RB to/TO eat/NN ;/: less/NNP dishes/VBZ to/TO do/VB and/CC more/VB environmentally/RB friendly/RB ./.
``/`` Could/JJ we/PRP have/VBP it/PRP to/TO go/VB but/CC eat/VB here/RB instead/RB ?/. ''/''
``/`` Thats/RB exactly/RB what/WP i/NNP dont/NN want/NN ./.
Its/PRP$ only/RB for/IN here/RB or/CC take/VB out/RP ./. ''/''
With/IN that/DT tone/NN of/IN voice/NN ,/, i/NNP 'm/NNP boycotting/VBG that/IN place/NN and/CC he/PRP will/MD never/RB take/VB a/DT dime/NN from/IN me/PRP ./.
Ive/NNP done/VBD customer/NN service/NN for/IN 10/CD years/NNS and/CC thats/NNS surely/RB not/RB how/WRB you/PRP make/VBP clients/NNS feel/VBP welcome/NN ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP im/JJ better/NN off/IN giving/NN my/NN money/NN to/TO a/DT poutine/NN place/NN that/WDT actually/RB deserves/VBZ it/PRP before/IN acting/VBG all/DT pretentious/JJ ./.
Finally/RB found/VBD THE/NNP go-to/NN place/NN for/IN a/DT quick/JJ cheap/NN bite/NN at/IN anytime/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, on/IN St-Laurent/JJ ./.
They/PRP open/VBP late/JJ too/RB !/.
As/IN a/DT regular/JJ customer/NN ,/, I/PRP usually/RB go/VBP for/IN two/CD burgers-/JJ the/DT beef/NN burger/NN and/CC the/DT tofu/NN burger/NN ./.
Both/NNS are/VBP great/JJ ./.
You/PRP can/MD choose/VB add-ons/NNS on/IN your/PRP$ burger/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT staff/NN will/MD hand/VB you/PRP a/DT sheet/NN to/TO mark/NN what/WP you/PRP want/VBP ./.
The/DT burgers/NNS are/VBP small/JJ but/CC they/PRP are/VBP inexpensive/JJ ./.
Be/NNP aware/VBP that/IN the/DT buns/NNS are/VBP ciabatta/NN buns/NNS -/JJ if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP an/DT avid/JJ fan/NN of/IN brioche/JJ buns/NNS ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP tried/VBN the/DT potato/NN fries/VBZ once/RB and/CC they/PRP are/VBP great/JJ !/.
Now/RB ,/, the/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.
A/DT very/NN ``/`` plateau/NN ''/'' vibe/NN with/IN good/JJ service/NN ./.
Note/NN that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ very/RB small/JJ ,/, but/CC size/NN does/VBZ not/RB matter/VB here/RB ./.
The/DT customers/NNS usually/RB go/VBP for/IN a/DT quick/JJ meal/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB better/JJ to/TO take-out/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP do/VBP take-out/JJ ,/, you/PRP might/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB a/DT while/NN before/IN getting/NNP your/NNP food/NN ./.
The/DT kitchen/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG what/WP they/PRP can/MD to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ food/NN as/RB fast/JJ as/IN possible/JJ but/CC you/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO wait/NN ./.
Honestly/RB I/PRP always/RB wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB this/DT place/NN and/CC was/VBD disappointed/JJ .../: .I/NNP ordered/NNP a/DT poutine/NN to/TO go/VB and/CC honestly/RB you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB get/VB much/RB for/IN $/$ 5.16/CD after/IN 4/CD bites/NNS its/PRP$ gone/NN sauce/NN nothing/NN special/JJ .../: .oh/JJ yeah/JJ maybe/NN its/PRP$ the/DT olive/JJ they/PRP put/VBP on/IN top/NN that/IN costs/NNS a/DT fortune/NN !/.
!/NN
someone/NN once/RB aptly/RB described/VB the/DT poutine/NN situation/NN in/IN Montreal/NNP to/TO me/PRP as/IN such/JJ :/: ''/'' drunk/NN teenagers/NNS from/IN Ontario/NNP go/NNP to/TO La/VB Banquise/NNP and/CC men/NNP from/IN Quebec/NNP go/NNP to/TO Patati/NNP Patata/NNP ''/'' its/PRP$ true/NN ./.
this/DT place/NN rules/NNS ./.
of/IN course/NN I/PRP dont/VBD eat/JJ poutine/NN or/CC meat/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP go/VBP for/IN their/PRP$ amazing/JJ tofu/NN sliders/NNS ./.
Is/NNP this/DT poutine/NN heaven/NN or/CC is/VBZ this/DT real/JJ life/NN ?/.
I/PRP wish/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT big/JJ restaurant/NN rather/RB than/IN a/DT tiny/NN diner/NN so/IN I/PRP can/MD eat/VB there/RB more/RBR often/RB ./.
Disclaimer/NN :/: This/DT review/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN two/CD vastly/JJ different/JJ experiences/NNS that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN with/IN the/DT poutine/NN here/RB ./.
The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP had/VBD it/PRP was/VBD for/IN takeout/NN a/DT little/NN under/IN a/DT year/NN ago/IN ,/, and/CC unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB awful/JJ ./.
While/IN the/DT fries/NNS were/VBD deliciously/RB crisp/JJ and/CC held/VBD the/DT gravy/NN and/CC cheese/NN curds/NNS well/RB ,/, the/DT gravy/NN was/VBD so/RB salty/JJ and/CC olive-y/JJ that/IN I/PRP could/MD n't/RB even/RB finish/VB it/PRP ./.
I/PRP swore/VBP I/PRP would/MD never/RB go/VB there/RB again/RB ,/, but/CC out/IN of/IN curiosity/NN ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB it/PRP another/DT chance/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP went/VBD there/RB recently/RB ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO eat/NN in/IN ,/, and/CC upon/IN first/JJ bite/NN ,/, it/PRP actually/RB tasted/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./.
Perhaps/NNP it/PRP was/VBD because/IN I/PRP was/VBD famished/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP finished/VBD off/RP the/DT whole/JJ plate/NN without/IN losing/NN my/NN appetite/NN ./.
Maybe/NNP it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT gravy/NN ,/, when/WRB put/NNS on/IN a/DT plate/NN ,/, has/VBZ more/RBR room/NN to/TO spread/VB out/RP and/CC evenly/RB distribute/VB itself/PRP among/IN the/DT fries/NNS than/IN when/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB sitting/VBG on/IN top/JJ of/IN them/PRP in/IN a/DT box/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP had/VBD a/DT unique/JJ flavor/NN to/TO it/PRP that/IN made/VBN it/PRP quite/RB addictive/JJ ./.
I/PRP left/VBD feeling/VBG very/RB satisfied/JJ and/CC content/JJ with/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, long/RB story/JJ short/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ probably/RB best/JJ to/TO eat/VB Patati/NNP Patata/NNP 's/POS poutine/NN inside/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB much/JJ tastier/NN ,/, easier/VBD to/TO digest/VB ,/, and/CC feel/RB less/RBR like/IN salt/NN overkill/NN than/IN if/IN you/PRP take/VBP it/PRP to/TO go/VB ./.
This/DT was/VBD my/VBN go-to/NN breakfast/NN spot/NN while/IN on/IN my/PRP$ mini/NN get-away/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD recommended/VBN this/DT place/NN by/IN a/DT friend/NN and/CC it/PRP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB ./.
Food/NNP and/CC service/NNP were/VBD superb/NN !/.
Customer/NNP service/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ -/JJ the/DT guys/NNS were/VBD so/RB nice/JJ and/CC friendly/RB ./.
The/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN were/VBD acceptable/JJ -/JJ not/RB dirt/VB cheap/NN but/CC not/RB ridiculously/RB expensive/JJ -/JJ I/PRP 'd/MD say/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ averagely/RB priced/VBN ./.
While/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/JJ small/JJ ,/, the/DT vibe/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
Only/RB complaint/JJ -/JJ although/IN I/PRP did/VBD not/RB bring/VB it/PRP to/TO their/PRP$ attention/NN -/NN was/VBD that/IN my/NN last/JJ meal/NN there/RB had/VBD a/DT long/JJ thick/NN black/NN hair/NN tangled/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ bacon/NN (/NN if/IN you/PRP zoom/VBP into/IN my/PRP$ picture/NN -/JJ you/PRP can/MD see/VB the/DT strand/NN of/IN hair/NN over/IN the/DT eggs/NNS ,/, orange/NN and/CC bacon/NN on/IN the/DT right/NN )/NN :/: (/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB easily/RB grossed/VBN out/RP and/CC I/PRP know/VBP this/DT happens/NN so/IN I/PRP let/VBP it/PRP pass/VBZ ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT -/JJ great/JJ cute/NN place/NN on/IN a/DT budget/NN ./.
Will/NNP definitely/RB come/VBN by/IN again/RB when/WRB I/PRP 'm/VBP back/RB in/IN Montreal/NNP !/.
So/RB ,/, at/IN first/JJ you/PRP see/VB its/PRP$ small/NN ./.
If/IN they/PRP 're/VBP busy/NN ,/, its/PRP$ crowded/NN and/CC a/DT small/JJ line/NN leads/VBZ out/RP front/NN ./.
EVEN/NNP with/IN that/DT against/IN us/PRP ,/, we/PRP waited/VBD and/CC ordered/NN and/CC MAN/NNP was/VBD it/PRP worth/IN it/PRP ./.
First/NNP ,/, the/DT gentleman/NN who/WP took/VBD our/PRP$ order/NN was/VBD friendly/RB and/CC courteous/JJ ./.
He/PRP helped/VBD us/PRP decide/VB on/IN our/PRP$ food/NN since/IN it/PRP was/VBD our/VBN first/JJ time/NN there/NN ./.
We/PRP ended/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT small/JJ variety/NN that/IN included/VBD the/DT poutine/NN and/CC their/PRP$ Mediterranean/NNP Burger/NNP ./.
BOTH/NNP WERE/NNP DELICIOUS/NNP !/.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, make/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP try/VBP the/DT Poutine..it/NNP really/RB is/VBZ that/IN good/JJ !/NN
